Better?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa asked while fixing Seol Jihu\u2019s crumpled hospital gown.", "Today, Seol Jihu had an appointment with a therapist. A patient suffering from severe depression naturally needed to get their mental illness treated.", "But in truth, no such appointment had been made. The therapy was only a pretext to take Seol Jihu out. The reality was that he wasn\u2019t going to see a therapist, but a visitor.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa grabbed Seol Jihu\u2019s hand and led him outside. She glanced sideways stealthily while walking down the hallway.", "Seol Jihu was still showing zero reaction. This obviously wasn\u2019t a good sign. He used to at least act like he was annoyed, but now he was completely emotionless.", "He was walking, but it was more like he was being dragged on his feet. He seemed to be suppressing his emotions forcefully.", "And if his pent-up emotions ever burst out one day\u2026.", "Yoo Seonhwa secretly did not want Seol Jihu to meet anyone from Paradise. Given how things turned out, she wanted him to forget about everything and start a new life on Earth. But recently, she had a change of heart.", "She expected Seol Jihu to be in a bad state after losing his memories of Paradise, but she did not expect it to be this bad. His condition didn\u2019t improve after being hospitalized. In fact, he was developing aphasia and was becoming more and more reliant on drugs\u2026.", "Judging that this couldn\u2019t go on, Yoo Seonhwa accepted the request of someone who was asking to see Seol Jihu just once.", "She was clutching at straws, hoping that this meeting would initiate even a small change in Seol Jihu.", "\u201cOver here.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa stopped at a reception room. Because they were on the hospital\u2019s VIP floor, there weren\u2019t that many people in the area.", "\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting out here in the hallway. The therapist wants to talk to you one on one before the official session.\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu just standing in front of the open door, Yoo Seonhwa gently pushed his back.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s nothing serious. Just pretend like you\u2019re talking to a friend.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stepped inside. The door closed behind him. Inside the reception room was someone wearing a white suit and open-toed shoes. The person\u2019s long hair and fair skin made it evident that she was a young woman.", "One thing Seol Jihu immediately noted was her pulled-down hat and sunglasses.", "The woman raised her head and looked at Seol Jihu. Seol Jihu also stood still and looked at her in a daze.", "An awkward silence flowed in the air. Soon, the woman took off her hat and sunglasses. When Seol Jihu saw her eyes that were slightly tinged red, he frowned without even knowing why.", "[Haven't we met somewhere before?]", "He suddenly remembered what the woman he met on the rooftop said.", "That was how Seol Jihu currently felt.", "At first, he thought the woman was Yoo Seonhwa. But upon taking a closer look at her face, he realized they were clearly different. They gave off a similar aura, but it was only similar, not the same. But then again, with seven billion people on Earth, it probably wasn\u2019t surprising for one or two people to be alike.", "The reason Seol Jihu frowned was that he felt like he had seen her somewhere before, even though this was definitely the first time he was seeing her.", "\u2018Again\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu pressed his forehead, feeling an intense headache swirling inside his head. It was the same phenomenon that came whenever he tried to force himself to remember.", "Just by meeting her eyes, a powerful headache tormented him.", "\u201cAre you alright?\u201d", "At that moment, he heard the woman\u2019s voice. Seol Jihu panted with a pale face and lowered his gaze. He no longer had the confidence to keep looking at her.", "Once he stared at the ground for some time, he felt his headache subside a little.", "\u201cYour face\u2026.\u201d", "A grunt escaped Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth.", "\u201cMy face?\u201d", "The woman blinked in confusion before doing a double-take and putting back her sunglasses. Shortly afterward, Seol Jihu barely managed to look at his therapist again.", "\u201cBy any chance\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu collected his breath and eked out a sentence.", "\u201cHave I\u2026 seen you somewhere before\u2026?\u201d", "If Yoo Seonhwa knew, she would have jumped high in surprise. She had never seen Seol Jihu talk on his own accord after his hospitalization.", "Seol Jihu himself was surprised. The words had practically come out subconsciously.", "The woman also seemed surprised. Though she covered her eyes with her sunglasses, a faint smile could be seen from her lips.", "\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d", "She asked after fixing her posture. She sounded like she had her hopes up slightly.", "Feeling her expectation, Seol Jihu suddenly felt pressured.", "\u201cWould you like to take a seat?\u201d", "The woman offered gently. However, Seol Jihu did not budge from the door. The longer his silence went on, the more anxious the woman\u2019s expression became.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d", "She asked out of the blue. No, perhaps it wasn\u2019t so strange for a therapist to ask for her patient\u2019s name. However, Seol Jihu narrowed his eyes in a frown.", "For some reason, that question just now seemed\u2026.", "\u201cMy name is Seo Yuhui, by the way.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui\u2026. Seo Yuhui? Seol Jihu repeated her name in his head and was suddenly struck by a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d", "She asked again.", "\u201c\u2026Seol\u2026 Seol\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stammered.", "\u201cSeol? Your name is Seol?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s tone became sharp as if she wasn\u2019t satisfied with his answer.", "\u201cThat\u2019s not your name. Seol is your last name. I\u2019m asking for the name you go by.\u201d", "Speaking with her hands clenched, she sounded solemn as if she made a resolute determination.", "It was because she couldn\u2019t accept it.", "[\u2026It\u2019s Seol.]", "[\u2026Seol. My name\u2019s Seol.]", "The fact that he was hesitant to reveal his name meant that he really forgot everything and returned to the way he was.", "Seo Yuhui could not allow this to happen. He had to be able to say it. Being able to say his own name confidently was the first step.", "However, Seol Jihu, who did not know what Seo Yuhui was thinking, could only feel flustered. It looked like she knew his name. He just didn\u2019t understand why she was so insistent on making him say it.", "\u201cMy\u2026 my name is\u2026\u201d", "Wouldn\u2019t it be okay to just gloss over it?", "\u201cSeol\u2026.\u201d", "But despite this\u2026", "\u201cSeol\u2026.\u201d", "For some reason\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u2026He just couldn\u2019t.", "Just saying a name shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, so why was it that \u201cSeol\u201d stuck to his mouth more? And why did he hesitate to say his own name?", "There was one thing for sure. The inexplicable sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu he felt when he first met the therapist was raging like bugs were crawling on his skin. If something went wrong and this feeling burst, he felt like he would be swarmed with an overwhelming amount of pain.", "And so, he wanted to run away before that happened. How else would he avoid the terrifying sense of emptiness that came along with the painful headache?", "\u201cGo on. I\u2019m sure you can say your name\u2026?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui flinched just as she finished her sentence. Seol Jihu didn\u2019t seem to be in a good state. He was convulsing to a noticeable degree, and half of his body was already turned toward the door.", "\u201cHold on.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui got up. Just as she took a single step toward Seol Jihu\u2026 Kwang! The reception room\u2019s door burst open.", "Seol Jihu ran outside after throwing the door open and ran as fast as he could. He heard the woman cry out to him longingly, and he also heard Yoo Seonhwa call his name in a startle.", "Despite this, Seol Jihu kept running. He did not pay attention to anything else and just ran.", "He was frustrated at himself for not even being able to say his name. He was disappointed at himself for being scared without even knowing what he was scared about. It was so ridiculous and pitiful\u2026 that he felt like he was going crazy.", "Seol Jihu ran aimlessly without a destination. Then, he stopped just before he jumped down the stairs.", "A few nurses, who were coming up, widened their eyes when they saw him.", "Seol Jihu turned around immediately. He ran up the stairs without a plan. Plowing his way through the people who were dodging left and right, he arrived at the hospital\u2019s rooftop.", "When he came to a stop after running like a raging bull, glares fell on him from the surroundings. Seol Jihu looked around with an agitated face before fixing his gaze in one spot.", "Beyond the guardrails that were like the steel bars of a prison, he saw a blue sky filled with leisurely flowing white clouds.", "His panting subsided.", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "For some reason, the vast azure sky beyond the guardrails looked more limitless and refreshing than ever before.", "The stuffy feeling in his heart popped open. The flowing, beard-like clouds seemed to be beckoning at him to jump.", "A trip.", "[To somewhere no one knows.]", "A trip to the sky.", "Then, just as he began to walk as if he was enchanted by something\u2026", "\u201cJIHU!\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s body suddenly fell forward.", "Yoo Seonhwa, who had followed him to the rooftop, pounced on him. Nurses then ran up to him and put restraints on the struggling Seol Jihu\u2019s body.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Hmm?\u201d", "A small scuffle broke out.", "Despite being dragged away at the end, Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes remained fixed on the clear, azure sky beyond the guardrails.", "*", "Seol Jihu returned to his hospital room. Perhaps because he was given a sedative, he became quiet again.", "\u201cThat was rude, you know.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa feigned a smile as she looked at Seol Jihu, who was lying on his bed, staring out of the window.", "\u201cThe therapist\u2026 she was crying, you know. She went back, crying her eyes out. The shock must have been great.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa spoke jokingly, but her expression didn\u2019t seem like she was joking in the slightest.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy\u2026 for her to come all the way here\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu remained silent. Yoo Seonhwa felt like she was talking to a wall, so she stealthily lowered her eyes and grabbed her handbag with a sigh.", "Then, just as she was about to say something\u2026", "\u201cDream\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu muttered a word.", "\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cWhat was that\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cDream\u2026 I think I had a dream\u2026.\u201d", "A hoarse voice escaped his mouth.", "\u201cA dream?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head at Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s question.", "\u201cBut\u2026 I don\u2019t remember it\u2026\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s eyes spun. She wanted to respond but didn\u2019t know what was appropriate to say. She spoke after a brief hesitation.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t that how dreams are? It\u2019s not like they really happened, right? It\u2019s normal to forget once you wake up.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyebrows twitched.", "\u201c\u2026No.\u201d", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a dream\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes turned hazy.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure of it\u2026.\u201d", "After muttering like fleeting wind, Seol Jihu closed his mouth shut.", "Yoo Seonhwa listened absent-mindedly and asked him to clarify what he meant, but Seol Jihu\u2019s sealed lips did not re-open.", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve gotta go for today.

Seol Jihu was still lying on his bed, blankly staring at the ceiling.", "As if he was dreaming.", "Yoo Seonhwa quietly left the room and took out her phone. Her finger hovered above the recent calls button before she ultimately pressed it and hit the call button.", "The call connected before the dial rang twice.", "\u201cYes, hello, it\u2019s about what you said before\u2026.\u201d", "After talking for a bit, Yoo Seonhwa took a deep breath and spoke.", "\u201cWhere should I go?\u201d", "*", "Roe Scheherazade was looking outside with a bored face.", "Next to Yun Seora was a severed head with a distorted facial expression. It was the head of Sinyoung\u2019s chairman, Yun Seojin.", "How could she forget? He was the one who was responsible for her current state.", "Roe Scheherazade apathetically gazed at Yun Seojin\u2019s face, distorted with pain before moving her gaze to Yun Seora.", "A hint of interest flashed on her otherwise bored expression.", "\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade struck up a conversation while tilting her head.", "\u201cLooking at you, I suddenly got curious.\u201d", "She continued while looking down at Yun Seora.", "\u201cWhen it came to Sinyoung, I despised almost everyone. There were only two people whom I didn\u2019t hate.\u201d", "Yun Seora listened carefully while holding a blood-smeared longsword in her hand.", "\u201cOne was Sung Shihyun. The other is you.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade rested her chin on her left palm.", "\u201cSung Shihyun\u2026 had a terrible personality, but the reason I didn\u2019t hate him was that I coincidentally found out about the reason he defected and sympathized with him.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, we also rarely made contact,\u201d Roe Scheherazade added with a smirk.", "\u201cAs for you\u2026 how should I say this, I felt like I was seeing myself in you.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade suddenly tapped on the wall with her finger.", "\u201cYou were hated without doing anything wrong. You learned about my situation and tried to help me, but only got mocked by the executives for being a gutsy toy of the Yun family.

Two mothers, right? I doubt it ends there given Chairman Yun\u2019s behavior.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade snickered.", "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that, then was it for power?

It was then.", "\u201cI first met Oppa\u2026 in the Tutorial.\u201d", "Yun Seora began to speak.", "\u201cI entered Paradise with nothing but my pride guiding me\u2026 Nothing worked out at first.
