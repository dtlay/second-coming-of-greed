It was as if a misshaped boulder was dropped into a tranquil lake.", "He wanted to ask whether she was serious, but he could only hold his mouth agape.", "He couldn\u2019t find the words to speak. If Sicilia was an organization that only pursued profits like the Eva Alliance, then Seol Jihu would have been greatly disappointed and even berated them.", "But Sicilia was different. During the previous valley war, they complied with the Haramark Royal Family\u2019s conscription order without complaining and led the Earthlings from the frontlines.", "Cinzia herself had almost died fighting Unsightly Humility, and Agnes had suffered a critical injury of having both legs pulled out.", "If someone were to ask, \u2018Are you seeking freedom after performing your duties and responsibilities?\u2019 Then Sicilia could confidently answer, \u2018Yes.\u2019", "That was why Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t say anything. As Sicilia was an organization based in Haramark, he didn\u2019t have the justification to drag them into the Federation\u2019s war either.", "But it wasn\u2019t as if he could just give up and leave. As Philip Muller said, they needed the power of the Star of Sloth.", "Seol Jihu broke the silence and spoke.", "\u201cCan you tell me your reason?\u201d", "\u201cReason, huh.\u201d", "Cinzia watched Seol Jihu\u2019s constantly changing expression with an intrigued face before shrugging.", "\u201cOn the surface, it\u2019s because this might be the Parasite Queen\u2019s scheme like the last valley war. Haramark is a city that is on the frontlines, so Sicilia must be present to prepare for an ambush of a detached guerrilla force. Now, as I said, that is only the surface reason\u2026 but I suppose you are asking for my true reasoning.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared at her with a stiff expression, and Cinzia broke out into a grin.", "\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tell you. It is because I do not want to lead my subordinates into a war that is a guaranteed loss.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bit his lip.", "He knew the Parasites were in an advantageous position. That was the reason he was working so hard to overturn the status quo.", "Cinzia was only making a guess since she did not know all the details, but the way she spoke like defeat was a predetermined outcome made Seol Jihu feel uncomfortable.", "\u201cWar Hawks of the Southern Region. That is what some people call Sicilia. Do you know why?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026No.\u201d", "\u201cIt is because we won most of the wars we have led and participated in in the recent year. Although we had to compromise once near the end due to an intervention of a third-party, we never once suffered a humiliating defeat.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Participate in winning wars and avoid losing wars. I have held true to this principle for any war that is beyond our obligation to join. From the day I founded Sicilia till now.\u201d", "The languid voice continued.", "\u201cOf course, I respect your heroism. I know you are an Irregular as well. But this war just isn\u2019t it, no matter how I think about it. There is not a single appealing point.\u201d", "\u201cBut we can\u2019t just sit around and watch. Once the Federation falls, humanity is next.\u201d", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t considered both the Parasites and the Federation perishing from this war?\u201d", "Cinzia placed her chin on the back of her interlocked hands and stared at Seol Jihu fixedly.", "\u201cIf I was the head of the Federation, I would have given up a mere Tigol Fortress a long time ago. Then I would have planned for the future. That is the best they can do.\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly describe Tigol Fortress as a mere fortress.\u201d", "\u201cI can. Yes, I admit that it is of great strategic importance as a connecting point to humanity. But now that the World Tree has withered, Tigol Fortress is nothing but an oversized toy.\u201d", "\u201cMiss Cinzia.\u201d", "\u201cStop.\u201d", "As Seol Jihu tried to persuade her again, Cinzia cut him off firmly.", "\u201cDo not pester me. When I say no, I mean no.\u201d", "Seol Jihu clenched his teeth.", "\u201cI might have given it some thought had you asked me to help create a situation that could lead to victory. But you want me to send my men to Tigol Fortress without reason? Did you really think I would say yes to a request to send my precious subordinates to their death?\u201d", "Seol Jihu quietly swallowed his saliva. He could feel unrelenting willpower from each of Cinzia\u2019s words.", "\u201cIf you really want me to take action, create a situation that would convince me that victory is plausible.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cNow if you understand that, get up. I am minding my words out of respect for the things you have accomplished thus far, but know that I am being extremely patient with you right now, Representative Seol.\u201d", "She made it clear that she would have kicked him out long ago if he wasn\u2019t Seol Jihu.", "However, Seol Jihu did not get up. He knew Cinzia might reject his request. Although his heart was bitter, he had to aim for the second-best scenario now that he knew the first-best wasn\u2019t possible.", "\u201c\u2026If I could create such a situation first, I would have done so before coming here.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke calmly.", "\u201cBut the current situation isn\u2019t so good. Even if we try to do something, I don\u2019t think the Parasite Queen will sit still.\u201d", "\u201cOf course. So what?\u201d", "Her tone was curtly asking what Seol Jihu was trying to get at.", "Cinzia hated talking in a roundabout way. So Seol Jihu also cut to the chase.", "\u201cEven if you do not plan to join the war, I would like you to be on standby near the battlefield.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cI will revive the World Tree.\u201d", "Cinzia\u2019s eyebrows went up. Seol Jihu finally mentioned this detail, and a silence that was like thin ice descended over the room.", "\u201c\u2026So you\u2019re telling me\u2014\u201d", "Cinzia tilted her head up with a deep gaze.", "\u201cSee the status of the battle and confirm the revival of the World Tree before deciding whether to go into war or not.\u201d", "\u201cI am only asking you to be ready to join the battle at a moment\u2019s notice. Even if I succeed in reviving the World Tree, if\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI understand what you\u2019re getting at. You\u2019re worried that the war would be over by the time Sicilia receives news of your success and arrives at Tigol Fortress.\u201d", "\u201cThe Star of Avarice said that he cannot guarantee victory even if the World Tree is resurrected. Humanity needs to join hands with the Federation. Every Executor is a vital fighting force whose value cannot be measured.\u201d", "Seol Jihu pleaded earnestly. Cinzia crossed her arms and dropped her head. Unlike before, she didn\u2019t refuse outright. As a Magician herself, she acknowledged the possibility of crossing over to the Spirit Realm through the Astral World.", "Moreover, Seol Jihu had shown her the Seed of the World Tree and Aphriso\u2019s Sedge, proving that his plan was not unfounded.", "\u201cIf the World Tree revives\u2026.\u201d", "In the past when the World Tree was healthy, Tigol Fortress was an impregnable wall to the Parasites, even withstanding an invasion of 200 Nests and five Army Commanders.", "Of course, the Federation also had to devote all of their manpower in defending the fortress, thus resulting in the current situation from being unable to attend to the Spirit Realm.", "In any case, there was one thing that was certain. And it was that this war could go in any direction if Seol Jihu\u2019s plan worked.", "\u201c\u2026Indeed, the value of Tigol Fortress would increase drastically if your plan worked.\u201d", "Although she couldn\u2019t talk like success was guaranteed, that was where Seol Jihu\u2019s interesting suggestion came in.", "He had asked Sicilia to only stand by near the fortress, waiting until the World Tree\u2019s revival to decide whether to join the battle or not.", "\u201cEnter the battle if victory seems plausible, pull out and return if it doesn\u2019t. Although I\u2019d still have to move my troops, you\u2019re saying you will give the final say.\u201d", "Cinzia replied after thinking for a long time.", "\u201cNot a bad offer. At least, it\u2019s much better than asking us to be meat shields.\u201d", "She smiled blandly and continued.", "\u201cI will have to give it some more thought, but that at least gives me the pretext to lead my men.\u201d", "She returned a positive reply given the much more relaxed conditions.", "\u201cBut let me tell you now\u2014 Don\u2019t expect us to help just because we are there. I will issue a withdrawal command the moment I think all hope is lost.\u201d", "\u201cActually, that\u2019s why I want to ask you for a favor.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took a deep breath before continuing.", "\u201cPlease let us borrow Miss Agnes.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "\u201cWe would like Miss Agnes\u2019 help in saving the Spirit Realm.\u201d", "Cinzia furrowed her brows at the unexpected request. At the same time, Agnes\u2019 eyes lit up.", "Seol Jihu originally wanted to bring Cinzia. But that should not be done and could not be done.", "Her position made it difficult for her to make reckless moves, and given Haramark\u2019s characteristics, it was right for her to remain in the Middle World to command the Earthlings.", "That was why he asked for Agnes. If a pheasant wouldn\u2019t do, he\u2019d settle for a chicken. Though Agnes wasn\u2019t as strong as an Executor, her strength was widely recognized in Paradise as one of the best.", "\u201cYou told me before, right? That you can lend your strength to create a situation that could lead to victory.\u201d", "Cinzia looked as if she\u2019d taken a blow, her expression as if she\u2019d just been checkmated.", "\u201cYou\u2026\u201d", "Cinzia suddenly snorted.", "\u201cWas this your goal this entire time?\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say anything. He only stared at her fixedly.", "Cinzia chuckled.", "\u201cThis is why people should be careful with their words. You must have learned a thing or two from that sly fox.\u201d", "\u201cPlease. Miss Agnes being there will significantly increase the chance of the World Tree reviving.\u201d", "\u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt that. After all, the Evil-Hunting Tarantula\u2019s ability boasts exceptional power in rampaging on a battlefield. There\u2019s just one thing\u2026\u201d", "Cinzia trailed off, the corner of her lips curling up. She looked like she was contemplating her options but also like she was enjoying this situation.", "After a moment of silence, Cinzia spoke.", "\u201cHow very difficult. I just can\u2019t be sure. Really, this is the first time I\u2019ve run into a decision as hard as this.\u201d", "She shook her head left and right before glancing sideways.", "\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d", "\u201cI think it would be a good idea to go.\u201d", "Unexpectedly, Agnes replied right away.", "Cinzia exclaimed, \u201cHoh! And your reason is?\u201d", "\u201cFrom what he\u2019s told us, this plan of his seems quite solid. Given that you, Boss, didn\u2019t say anything when the Astral World was mentioned, entering the Spirit Realm through it seems like a realistic method.\u201d", "\u201cAnd?\u201d", "\u201cI also believe it is a good mission for my current situation. I have been stuck at Level 6 for quite some time now. Seeing this mission to a successful completion might be able to help me take the last step to Level 7.\u201d", "\u201cIs that all?\u201d", "Agnes continued speaking at Cinzia\u2019s neverending questions.", "\u201cMost importantly, if everyone that Representative Seol mentioned comes, then this expedition team would be a one-of-a-kind, never-seen-before in the history of Paradise. The legends whose names are only heard are gathering. I must admit that I\u2019d like to work alongside them.\u201d", "Agnes gave a firm, level-headed response befitting her character.", "Cinzia, who was listening silently, burst out into laughter.", "\u201cYou did not mention the dangers associated with going to the Spirit Realm. Is that to hide the heart of a mother who wants to help her troubled cub?\u201d", "Agnes did not reply. She quietly averted her gaze and looked outside the window. Cinzia clicked her tongue and sighed.", "\u201cThey say there\u2019s no point in raising a daughter. Now I know what it means.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not your daughter, Boss.\u201d", "\u201cI raised you like one. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d", "Cinzia waved her hand dismissively. Then, seeing Seol Jihu\u2019s nervous face, she revealed her teeth in a smile.", "\u201cFine. Do as you want. There is what I said before, and plus, the person herself wants to go.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s complexion brightened instantly.", "\u201cThank you, Don Cinzia. And you too, Miss Agnes!\u201d", "Agnes snorted. She slightly tilted her head up and spoke with a high nose.", "\u201cWhen will the expedition team depart?\u201d", "\u201cThere is no set date, but I\u2019m hoping to go as soon as possible.\u201d", "\u201cGot it. But I need time to prepare, so it will be difficult to leave right away.\u201d", "\u201cOf course. When can I expect you?\u201d", "\u201cA day is enough. I will go to Carpe Diem\u2019s office tomorrow morning.\u201d", "Once Cinzia gave her permission, the slow story progressed hastily.", "\u201cI will need to stop by the stable and borrow a carriage then.\u201d", "\u201cIs there a need to go through all that trouble? Have you stopped by the Haramark Royal Palace?\u201d", "\u201cNot yet. I was planning to go after this.\u201d", "\u201cThen it should be fine. Ask Princess Teresa for the fastest carriage in Haramark. We will get back quicker that way.\u201d", "She had a point. Seol Jihu nodded his head.", "\u201cThen\u2026\u201d", "Agnes pushed her glasses up.", "\u201cI will see you tomorrow.\u201d", "*", "After the meeting, Seol Jihu went straight to the palace. It was to see Teresa for the first time in a while and also to tell her about the outcome of the meeting.", "Teresa was waiting for Seol Jihu on a chair, her arms and legs crossed in a proud manner.", "\u201cPrincess!\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu, who was delighted to meet her, she snorted loudly.", "\u201cHmph, that\u2019s funny.\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cI put down my pride and begged you not to leave, yet you cast me aside and left anyway. And now you\u2019ve come crawling back\u2026 Hoho! The world sure works in funny ways.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWhy, do I still look like the Teresa who pitifully begged for your love? I\u2019m sorry, but the old Teresa is no longer here.\u201d", "Seol Jihu made a dumbstruck expression.", "Teresa\u2019s lips contorted.", "\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s the face! I wanted to see that regretful face of yours when you eventually came back to me! Oho~ Ohohoho~!\u201d", "She even covered her mouth with the back of her hand and sneered.", "\u201cWhat are you standing around for? Didn\u2019t you come back because you needed my strength? Come on! It\u2019s your turn now. Get on your knees and beg tearfully, just like I did back then! Say you\u2019re sorry you abandoned me! Say you realized I am a thousand times better than that useless Queen of Eva!\u201d", "Seol Jihu stood still, only blinking rapidly. On one hand, he didn\u2019t have much to say, but on the other, he was seriously concerned for Teresa\u2019s sanity. Perhaps she just ate something wrong this morning?", "As Seol Jihu continued to stare at her worriedly, Teresa\u2019s laughter died down. She glanced at him repeatedly to check out his expression before slowly smacking her lips.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Kuhum.\u201d", "As an awkward silence flowed in the air, a small cough rang out. Soon, Teresa got up from her seat and trotted forward in short, quick steps.", "\u201cOh my! Jihu! When did you get here?\u201d", "She grabbed Seol Jihu\u2019s hands, looking overjoyed. Her change of attitude truly made Seol Jihu doubt his eyes.", "\u201cLong time no see! Did you miss me? I know I did!\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes. Princess, just now, you\u2014\u201d", "\u201cAh, don\u2019t mind that. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d", "\u201cNo, how can you call it \u2018nothing\u2019? Did\u2014\u201d", "\u201cOops, you found out. You see, there\u2019s another personality hidden inside me. I call her Enchantress or Dark Teresa. She sometimes pops out against my will. Just ignore her. I\u2019ve had this illness since I was young.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "\u2018I see, so that was Dark Teresa? Then should the current Teresa be considered Light Teresa?\u2019", "\u201cAnyway, how did your talk with Sicilia go?\u201d", "Teresa asked as if she just remembered it. She was obviously trying to change the subject, but Seol Jihu decided to let it go.", "Once he told her how the meeting went, Teresa was visibly surprised.", "\u201cWow, that much\u2026 There are conditions attached, but they\u2019re still moving their troops?\u201d", "She clapped rapidly and talked like Sicilia had agreed to do something insanely generous. It seemed there was a difference in Seol Jihu and Teresa\u2019s perception of Sicilia.", "\u201cThat\u2019s great! Since Sicilia is taking action, we should be able to issue a conscription order without difficulty.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bowed slightly.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. This would technically put Haramark at greater risk, yet you\u2019re sending your army in spite of it\u2026\u201d", "\u201cEii, I\u2019ll obviously leave behind some men to defend Haramark.\u201d", "Teresa put on a confident expression.", "\u201cAnd even if the Parasites invade, we will be able to hold out until reinforcements come. You haven\u2019t forgotten about the valley fortress, have you?\u201d", "Now that he thought about it, Arden Valley had a fortress as well. He had heard about the progress of the construction during his calls with Teresa, and last time he heard, the fortress had become big enough to cover half of the entire valley.", "Of course, no one could guarantee how long it would last against the Parasites, but unless one of the Seven Armies came with their commander, it would at least buy enough time for the troops to withdraw.", "\u201c\u2026I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d", "A thin smile appeared on Seol Jihu\u2019s face. The fortress he had risked his life to defend in the past was proving to be of great help to him.", "\u201cIt would be great if you could see Father and General Sanctus before leaving. Unfortunately, neither of them are here.\u201d", "\u201cThey must be busy, huh.\u201d", "\u201cYes. General Sanctus is busy building up our military power, and Father is meeting with the chief of the Equites battalion to convince him.\u201d", "\u201cEquites battalion?\u201d", "\u201cThey are the cavalry regiment that used to be the pride of Eva. While Haramark was known for their hoplites, Eva was known for their nimble lancers. Though, they\u2019ve voluntarily disbanded.\u201d", "Seol Jihu exclaimed. Looking back, the first thing Sorg K\u00fchne did after Valhalla became Eva\u2019s partner organization was reassembling the army.", "Eva\u2019s main units had disbanded voluntarily after the death of Eva\u2019s previous king, Campbell Aria. In other words, other than the guard force maintaining public order, the past Eva did not have an army to call forth.", "\u201cAlthough most of the veteran lancers scattered, a good number of them requested refugee status from other kingdoms. That, of course, includes Haramark. These men were granted refugee status in exchange for entering the kingdoms\u2019 military.\u201d", "\u201cI see.\u201d", "\u201cYes, so we interviewed the cavalrymen of the old Equites battalion and identified their captain. Father has gone to persuade him.\u201d", "Teresa explained everything in quick succession, then finally gave a wink.", "\u2018So quick.\u2019", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t hide his surprise. He began to understand why Philip Muller was so surprised after hearing about his preparations.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t expect the Haramark Royal Family to have done all this on their own. He clenched his fists unknowingly.", "\u2018So I wasn\u2019t just beating my head against the wall.\u2019", "Back when he was looking for the spring, he felt like he was cutting through obstructing vines without any help.", "But it turned out, he was never alone. The connections he built up until now were coming together one by one to empower him.", "Thinking so, courage surged up from the bottom of his stomach and filled his heart full.", "\u201cThey left their home because they were disappointed by Charlotte Aria and enraged by the Eva Alliance\u2019s tyranny. But that doesn\u2019t mean their loyalty to the Eva Royal Family disappeared. Since Charlotte Aria and Eva have both changed, they might choose to\u2014 Hm?\u201d", "Teresa stopped in the middle. It was because she felt a pair of rough hands grab her shoulders.", "Next, Seol Jihu\u2019s face slowly closed in, and his forehead touched her own.", "\u201cWheeeew\u2026\u201d", "A long breath flowing above her head tickled her hair.", "She blinked rapidly in a fluster. But after a moment, a warm smile spread across Teresa\u2019s mouth.", "She felt like she knew Seol Jihu\u2019s intention.", "[My head\u2026 pet my head.]", "[My back too.]", "Teresa had done the same thing when the Parasites had raised their army and invaded Arden Valley. Even after the royal family issued a draft call, the Earthlings had been uncooperative.", "At that time, Seol Jihu was the one she trusted and relied on.", "Looking back, it was truly mysterious. When her mind was ready to burst from the complex emotions of worry, fear, and frustration, just burying her face in his chest and feeling his touch had calmed her down.", "Should she say that she felt an unknown sense of security?", "But now, Seol Jihu was feeling a similar emotion as he trusted and relied on her.", "Thinking this, she began to feel good. Teresa slowly raised her hand and gently caressed Seol Jihu\u2019s back.", "Seol Jihu moaned quietly as warmth began to spread on his back.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been tough, huh?\u201d", "\u201cNo, not at all\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The weight on your shoulders must be crushing you.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026To be honest, yes. But thanks to you, Princess\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI know. Of course, I know. Why wouldn\u2019t I know?\u201d", "Teresa smiled bashfully and got on her tip-toes.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much.\u201d", "Burying his face in her warm bountiful chest, she closed her eyes gently.", "\u201cWe\u2026\u201d", "Her faint whisper slowly grew fainter. Then, using the strength she used to pull Seol Jihu in, she spoke in a clearer voice.", "\u201cWe will not lose. Not this time, not ever.\u201d"]}
