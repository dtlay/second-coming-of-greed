Penance (1)", "content": ["One thing Seol Jihu noticed while walking on the Path of the Soul was that this place also had four seasons.", "It was exceedingly hot when he first entered, but now a cool breeze gently brushed against his skin.", "It was now autumn.", "But just because the season changed, it didn\u2019t mean that he did anything different.", "Seol Jihu was still stuck at the first mountain path, trying to push the immobile boulder up.", "Thankfully, he wasn\u2019t without progress. He now only had eighteen steps to go to reach the first peak, and it was steadily decreasing.", "Once the late autumn passed, the air turned colder by the day.", "Seol Jihu could see his own breath.", "Winter, and along with it a bitter coldness had arrived.", "In truth, the cold wasn\u2019t much of a problem as his body was steaming anyways from climbing the mountain.", "One time, it snowed for seven days straight.", "And when the snow solidified, the slope froze up too.", "Pushing the boulder up was difficult enough. Now that Seol Jihu had to worry about slipping as well, he was on the verge of going insane.", "Getting used to the frozen slope was painful, but the eighteen steps he had left toward the finishing line increasing to fifty was even more despairing.", "He was so frustrated at one point that he gave up on the trial for several days and focused on breaking the ice on the path with the Spear of Purity.", "However, he soon realized it was meaningless as it snowed nearly every day.", "He also heard Black Seol Jihu say, \u201cAha, so even when you\u2019re fighting an Army Commander, you\u2019re going to say, hey, it\u2019s slippery, so let\u2019s stop fighting and clean up the ground a bit before continuing. Or we can fight when the weather\u2019s better.\u201d", "Then Seol Jihu stopped and quietly went back to pushing the boulder.", "In the end, yet another season had passed by the time he got used to the frozen ground and shortened the distance to less than twenty-five steps.", "The temperature warmed up, and the mountain threw its snow-white layer off.", "Although there were no trees or flowers on the mountain, a fresh, fragrant aroma filled the area.", "It was spring.", "With the frozen ground no longer being an obstacle, the distance to the finish line should have come back to eighteen steps.", "Of course, given the effort that he put in last season, he should be able to climb up a little more, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be more than a few steps.", "He was wrong.", "One step, two steps, four steps, eight steps\u2026 fifteen steps.", "The seed planted in winter had finally bloomed.", "His strength stat had not increased to High (Low), but he could feel the change it underwent.", "The shaking of his arms and legs grew worse with each step, but the boulder moved from the spot he expected to stop at.", "Seol Jihu was climbing the slope, though with great difficulty. Even he was surprised at his own progress.", "But when he was just one step away, the boulder creaked.", "It didn\u2019t stop. Instead, it swayed back and forth before the last step just like a rocking stone. It was as if it was making fun of him.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t give up. He stomped the ground with his heels and made a small groove in the slope.", "This was a technique he picked up during the winter, which lessened the burden of the boulder\u2019s weight by a bit.", "Planting his feet into the grooves, Seol Jihu collected his breath for a moment.", "The boulder still swayed back and forth, and Seol Jihu\u2019s heart rocked along with it.", "Soon, Seol Jihu held his breath and glared at the boulder.", "He leaned forward and squeezed out every ounce of strength in his body.", "The outcome would be one of three things. His arm would bend in, his feet would slip out and the boulder would crush him, or\u2026", "\u2018Please, please\u2026!\u2019", "Next, as Seol Jihu\u2019s face distorted like a hahoe mask\u2026", "Suddenly, the weight disappeared.", "The rolling that started from his arms caused his body to dance up and down.", "\u201c\u2026Uh\u2026\u201d", "With a slosh, he belatedly felt something going over his hands.", "Swaying from the sudden disappearance of the weight, Seol Jihu narrowly grabbed ahold of himself and stepped forward.", "Once he regained his balance, he no longer saw a sloped path, but rather a flat ground.", "His left foot was straddled over the first peak.", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "There was no need to think any further.", "Seol Jihu immediately hopped up to the first peak.", "[You passed the first trial.][The restriction of class and miscellaneous abilities is lifted.][The restriction of mana is lifted.][All artifacts are unsealed.]", "Several messages popped up.", "He had seen a few of them before, but the first message was new.", "He had finally passed the first trial.", "\u201cUwaaaah\u2026.\u201d", "A groan escaped his mouth, but his expression was fuzzy with happiness.", "Seol Jihu stared at the boulder, hopped up and down on the flat ground, then looked back.", "He could see a steep, sliding slope stretching far below.", "Only now did he feel how far he\u2019d come.", "He was singing \u2018I did it, I did it\u2019 on the inside, but remained quiet on the outside. He sat on the first peak and dazedly looked down at the slope.", "A timely spring breeze blew and cooled off his heated body.", "\u2018I never thought this day would come\u2026\u2019", "Looking back, the first trial felt just like when he was in mandatory military service.", "[1]He couldn\u2019t even speak as a private second class soldier. He felt like he was trapped in a bottomless pit as a private first class soldier. Time seemed to flow insanely slowly when he was a senior private class soldier, and he even hallucinated that he was trapped in a Hyperbolic Time Chamber when he was a master private class soldier.", "But the day he was discharged from the military \u2014 the moment he took one step out of the guardhouse \u2014 the world looked different.", "Just like now.", "Seol Jihu smiled as he stared at the mountain path stained with blood and sweat.", "He was both proud and thankful.", "Though there were some difficulties, he was proud of himself for gritting his teeth and climbing all the way up here.", "\u201cIyaaaaaaaaa!\u201d", "Inspired by the indescribable sense of accomplishment, Seol Jihu shot his arms out and screamed at the top of his lungs.", "The stifling feeling in his chest finally burst open, and courage sprang up from the bottom of his heart.

It\u2019s more like you scored 59.5 and got lucky to have it rounded up to 60.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu said as he pointed to the two small grooves on the ground.", "\u201cAnyway, a pass is a pass. What you did is still within acceptable limits, so con-fucking-grats.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yeah, thanks a lot.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t mind my tone. Think about my position a bit. I had to stand here and watch you for a whole year.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu said dejectedly before pulling out another tuft of weed and biting down on it.", "\u201cWell\u2026 be strong. The second trial won\u2019t even give you the chance to round up your score.\u201d", "Hearing this, Seol Jihu looked for the boulder.", "The boulder was sitting in front of the second slope before he noticed.", "It seemed to be waiting for him.", "When the nervous Seol Jihu stood in front of the boulder, an alarm struck his ears.", "[Follow the path and climb to the second mountain peak.]", "[1. Climbing while pushing the boulder up: you must take the boulder up to the peak without leaving a single scratch on it.]", "[2.

It won\u2019t be easy to use other high-level skills while maintaining that state. A fair restriction since you can use mana again, don\u2019t you think?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was silent for a long time.", "It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t understand the messages or what Black Seol Jihu said. It was because he had no clue how to go about this trial.", "First, the second mountain path looked to be several times longer than the first.", "The slope was several times steeper as well.", "Remembering how boulders suddenly appeared in the path and the crossroads, he didn\u2019t know how he would go about taking the boulder up without a scratch.", "The second method wasn\u2019t any easier. It said he had to reach the peak before any boulders appeared, but it wasn\u2019t a distance that he could race through in one go even if he used Flash Thunder and the triple-stacked Festina Earring.", "\u201cNot easy, huh? Iya, I wonder how long you\u2019ll take to complete this one. Since the first trial took one year\u2026 two years? Three years? Ah, wait, we have to calculate in Paradise\u2019s time. 73 days? 110 days?\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu\u2019s snide remarks rang out.", "\u201cWell\u2026 it will at least be more exciting than the first trial. Instantaneous decision making plays an important role in determining life and death, you see. Quick decision and quick implementation will be the key to passing this trial.\u201d", "Seol Jihu heeded Black Seol Jihu\u2019s advice as he hardened his will to fight.", "There was no need to be scared this early on.", "It was the same one year ago.", "Though the end seemed impossibly far away, didn\u2019t he succeed in the end?", "Right, why not just face it head-on?

I can\u2019t get anywhere close to them even if I reach out my hands, so how can I dare to evaluate them?]", "Seol Jihu held his anger in, recalling what Jang Maldong said in the past.", "Even Jang Maldong separated High Rankers into true and false ones. Who was to say Black Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t do the same?", "\u201cEhew\u2026 you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not that old man\u2019s fault. How would he know you have something like Future Vision?
