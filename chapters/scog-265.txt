Right?\u201d", "Maria rejoiced when Kim Hannah took her side. Then, she sent Seol Jihu a gloating smile.", "\u201cLet me ask just to be sure\u2026\u201d", "Clack, clack. Kim Hannah walked over to Maria and placed her hand on Maria\u2019s head.", "\u201cWhen you say Golden Lion, you mean the animal, right?\u201d[1]", "\u201cHm?\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t say it to mean Buy Gold, right?\u201d", "Maria looked up at Kim Hannah with a flustered expression. For a split second, her pupils shook. Kim Hannah didn\u2019t miss this reaction.", "\u201cJeez!\u201d", "\u201cAak!\u201d", "Kim Hannah pushed Maria\u2019s head away before turning to Seol Jihu.", "\u201c\u2026Anyway, what do you think? I say you should choose between Valhalla and Golden Lion.\u201d", "Seol Jihu hesitated. Speaking truthfully, he wasn\u2019t sure if these names were okay, but they certainly had points that caught his fancy.", "Valhalla, the mythological palace and the utopia where only the most honorable and heroic warriors could enter under the Valkyries\u2019 guidance.", "Golden Lion, \u2018gold\u2019 representing the Golden Commandment and \u2018lion\u2019 representing courage and the king of all beasts.", "\u201cValhalla. It\u2019s decent. Not too much and not too little.\u201d", "\u201cGolden Lion. I like how intuitive it is. The organization\u2019s insignia will look nice too.\u201d", "The members\u2019 reactions were positive as well.", "\u201cAt the very least, they\u2019re better than The Strong or Tyrant! As for I came, I saw, I conquered\u2026! Uhuhuhuhu!\u201d", "Seol Jihu glared at the giggling Phi Sora. He wanted to choose the name he liked, but he had to be fair as the representative of an organization.", "\u201cIf we went with the name you chose, dear, I wouldn\u2019t be able to say what organization I\u2019m from out of embarrassment!\u201d", "Phi Sora hated the name that much. As someone who had suffered several times under Gula, he couldn\u2019t do the same thing.", "\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d", "In the end, he sighed and nodded his head.", "\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Valhalla or Golden Lion.\u201d", "Kim Hannah offered to put these two names for anonymous voting, but Seol Jihu suggested putting all the names mentioned up for voting as well.", "Just like that, a secret voting was held. The result: Valhalla received five votes and Golden Lion received five votes.", "And Veni, Vidi, Vici got two votes.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Everyone\u2019s gaze turned to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWow\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora couldn\u2019t hide her shock as she feigned a smile.

You have to pick a name that at least conforms to common sense! No, this is a matter of conscience!\u201d", "\u2018Common sense? Conscience?\u2019", "\u201cHe\u2019s like that because you baby him every day!\u201d", "Phi Sora cracked up as she hit the floor.", "\u201cNo\u2026 I just\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui dropped her head while stammering. Seol Jihu decided to write Phi Sora\u2019s name in today\u2019s diary entry.", "\u201cAlright, so it\u2019s 5:5\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah shook her head.", "\u201cJihu, you put all the names up for a vote so you can vote the one you like, right?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cPick again. You too, Miss Seo Yuhui.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "Seol Jihu grumbled.", "\u201cOnce you vote, that\u2019s it. What, I can\u2019t vote for the name I like?\u201d", "He wasn\u2019t wrong, so Kim Hannah didn\u2019t know what to say. It was then.", "\u201cPyak!\u201d", "A familiar chirp caused everyone to turn to the little chick. Kim Hannah muttered.", "\u201cAh, you were here too.\u201d", "\u201cPyak!\u201d", "The little chick dashed forward and stopped in front of Yi Sungjin. Once it pecked Yi Sungjin\u2019s side with its beak, Yi Sungjin groaned and twisted his body side to side.", "Kim Hannah asked just in case.", "\u201cCh\u2014 no, Arcus, you like Valhalla?\u201d", "\u201cPyak pyak!\u201d", "The little chick flapped its wings and nodded vehemently.", "\u201cHe says he likes Valhalla more. Golden Lion isn\u2019t bad, but apparently, it gives off a bad vibe.\u201d", "\u201cA bad vibe?\u201d", "\u201cYes, he says with that name, the group will fall to the abyss from one wrong choice after reaching the apex\u2026\u201d[2]", "Yi Seol-Ah translated the chick\u2019s words for the team. Kim Hannah had no idea what to make of that statement, but was satisfied with the extra vote.", "\u201cPerfect. With six votes, Valhalla is the winner. No one has any complaints, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu grumbled quietly but didn\u2019t have any objections. Just like that, the new organization\u2019s name was chosen to be Valhalla.", "Maria belatedly murmured in regret, \u201cI was gonna ask for a name usage fee or at least a naming fee\u2014\u201d", "So now, there was yet another reason to not choose Golden Lion.", "Kim Hannah wrote Valhalla in fancy handwriting, then stood up.", "\u201cI\u2019ll be off to the palace then. It shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d", "Then, she really came back in just two hours. Sorg K\u00fchne had approved the registration with blazing speed, just like he promised.", "\u201cHere.\u201d", "Kim Hannah held out a piece of paper stamped with the Eva Royal Family\u2019s insignia.", "It was the organization registration certificate.", "Seol Jihu stared at the certificate in a daze, then checked his Status Window. The affiliation\u2026", "[Your Status Window.][1. General Information]Affiliation: Valhalla", "\u2026had changed before he noticed.", "\u201cCongrats!\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke with a smile.", "\u201cNow, you\u2019re really the representative of an organization. Valhalla\u2019s representative.\u201d", "The words, Valhalla\u2019s representative, sounded strange, but he forcefully shook off the awkwardness. Now, it was time to break away from the title, Carpe Diem\u2019s leader.", "Seol Jihu clenched his fists.", "Finally, he had finally established an organization.", "And thus\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d", "Today\u2026", "\u201cThanks.\u201d", "Paradise saw the official birth of its 83rd organization.", "*", "Charlotte Aria. She was the queen of Eva and the Paradisian royalty who lived a very sheltered life.", "Of course, no one dared to say this to the queen\u2019s face, and considering Paradise\u2019s situation, saying that she was sheltered was a bit strange as well.", "Over ten years had passed since the outbreak of war. Paradise wasn\u2019t an environment where anyone could be \u2018sheltered\u2019. Still, there was a reason that Eva\u2019s queen was called \u2018sheltered\u2019.", "Strictly speaking, in Paradise, the main purpose of a woman of noble origin was to pass on her bloodline. As a result, many noblewomen married for political reasons.", "Meaning, Charlotte Aria was not someone who would have become a ruler. It wasn\u2019t as if there weren\u2019t any males in the royal family either.", "Of the previous king\u2019s two sons and one daughter, the oldest son had been crowned the heir to the throne and dutifully received the education of a future king, and the second son had been alive as well.", "That was how things were in the past, and that was how she lived her childhood.", "That was until the war broke out.", "While she was growing up being spoiled by her parents and two older brothers, an alien race suddenly invaded Paradise. The king, queen, and the crown prince all died in the chaos of war, and the alien race\u2019s overwhelming power made Charlotte Aria abandon the capital and escape to humanity\u2019s final line of defense.", "Even the Empire, which was filled with countless heroes, fell to the alien race in less than 4 years, so there was nothing a young girl, who knew nothing about politics could do other than stay inside the palace, shaking in fear.", "Thankfully, the second son, Campbell Aria, survived and took care of his younger sister with utmost care. However, he was killed in action during the war against the Federation.", "Having lost her last remaining family member, Charlotte Aria fell into depression. And as she was forced to rise to the throne without any preparation, there was no hope of the government being administered properly.", "Most of the royal family\u2019s retainers had died, and even the few who remained alive grew tired of the long war and one by one left to find their livelihood.", "In truth, Eva had lost hope the moment Campbell Aria died. Without Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s dedication and effort, Eva truly may have collapsed.", "Unfortunately, Charlotte Aria and Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s relationship had slowly turned sour during this long series of events.", "Sorg K\u00fchne had been serving the royal family even before Charlotte Aria was born, and he had dragged his old bones to help the royal family even after the war broke out.", "Moreover, he was the sole retainer who stayed with the royal family throughout all these years.", "Charlotte Aria knew this very well.", "But she had risen to the position of queen reluctantly. The war began when she was only four years old, and she had to abandon the capital to escape when she was just ten. Ever since, she had lived under Campbell Aria\u2019s protective shade.", "What could such a young girl who was now forced to face the cold reality do?", "She was already suffering from depression from losing her family. Every time Sorg K\u00fchne told her to be conscious of her position as the queen or to try to act like the previous king and second prince, an indescribable sorrow would well up inside her.", "She knew her inflexible old servant had good intentions, and she knew what he was saying was valuable advice. Even so, these matters were too complicated and burdensome for a young girl who had lived a spoiled life, to accept.", "On many occasions, she wanted to throw everything away and just run far away.", "And the person who came to her rescue was the Earthling, Evangeline Rose.", "Charlotte Aria was initially on guard against Earthlings, but began to open up to them after meeting Evangeline Rose.", "Despite not being a Paradisian, Evangeline Rose did her best for the benefit of Paradise and protected Charlotte Aria from nearby threats.", "Charlotte Aria followed Evangeline Rose like a younger sister, so much so that she often forgot her position as the queen. And when she heard of Evangeline Rose\u2019s death, she became severely depressed.", "Just like when she lost Campbell Aria, she refused to eat for several days and only cried.", "And Jung Sua was the person who appeared as the next batter.", "She had only seen Charlotte Aria a few times while following Evangeline Rose, but the two of them quickly grew closer while sharing the same pain of losing her.", "Jung Sua supported Charlotte Aria to the best of her ability, and Charlotte Aria did not reject her attention either. In fact, she accepted Jung Sua into her life as if it was natural.", "There really wasn\u2019t a better person to fill in the emptiness and loss caused by Evangeline Rose\u2019s death.", "Just like that, following Charlotte Aria\u2019s parents, Campbell Aria, and then Evangeline Rose, Jung Sua took on the role of her protector with ease.", "But now\u2026", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, queen.\u201d", "Even Jung Sua was trying to leave.", "\u201cIt looks like I have to leave.\u201d", "Jung Sua said to the queen after asking for a private meeting. Charlotte Aria slowly closed her eyes.", "\u201cYou\u2019re saying that again.\u201d", "\u201cNo, this matter will not end unless I leave.\u201d", "\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t do it, that you were being framed.\u201d", "\u201cBut you\u2019re the only one who believes in me. Everyone is saying that I\u2026\u201d", "Jung Sua trailed off. She began to sniffle from her reddened nose.", "\u201cI\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m tired of everything.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, queen. I wanted to serve you until the end, but\u2026\u201d", "Jung Sua spoke emotionally and with difficulty.", "\u201cIt looks like I couldn\u2019t become Evangeline Rose Unni. I realized it too late.\u201d", "She then smiled sorrowfully.", "\u201cThat\u2019s very interesting.\u201d", "A young, soft voice reflective of the queen\u2019s age rang out.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. You are not Evangeline Rose.\u201d", "She then spoke with an ambiguous smile.", "\u201cShe was\u2026 like an older sister to me. Her virtuous character and always serious and calm nature\u2026 they really reminded me of my first brother. She is someone I respect from the bottom of my heart.\u201d", "The queen\u2019s eyes dimmed as she reminisced about the past.", "\u201cYou are the same.\u201d", "\u201cMe?\u201d", "\u201cSua, you and I share similar pain.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria smiled innocently.", "\u201cI lost my parents from war. You said you also lost your parents when you were young, no?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "\u201cWhenever I hear your stories, it reminded me of my younger years.\u201d", "\u201cN-No, someone like me couldn\u2019t hold a candle to what you went through\u2026\u201d", "Jung Sua dropped her head at a loss for what to do like she was greatly sorry.", "A faint smile spread across Charlotte Aria\u2019s face.", "\u201cIndeed, our situation isn\u2019t exactly the same. But I am not trying to discuss who had more difficulty growing up or who suffered from more heartache. What is important is that no one else has understood me the way you do.\u201d", "1. The word \u2018lion\u2019 is \u2018Saja (\uc0ac\uc790)\u2019 in Korean, which is also the imperative verb form of \u2018To buy\u2019. So Golden Lion could also mean \u2018Let\u2019s buy gold.\u2019 ", "2. A MEMORIZE reference. "]}
