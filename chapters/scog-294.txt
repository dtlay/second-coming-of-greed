It was flailing about in a frenzy, yet Eun Yuri had succeeded in putting the spell balls in the monster\u2019s ear.

Even then, it would only be a possibility, not a guarantee.", "A survivor managed to accomplish what even the Archer of Steel wasn\u2019t guaranteed to succeed?", "It wasn\u2019t as if she sniped the Homunculus either.

A message had arrived alerting them that Stage 2 had ended and that they should gather in the central altar.", "However, Seol Jihu did not immediately head to the center of the island. Now that he thought about it, there was one more item he needed to get before entering the Neutral Zone.", "As such, he went to a nearby gacha machine, made Eun Yuri pull out the Guide\u2019s note, then put in 666 coins to pull the offering before heading to the altar.", "Several people were already gathered at the altar.

Well, passing it is another matter though.\u201d", "Phi Sora applauded Eun Yuri. She looked like she was in a good mood. But it was no surprise why Phi Sora saw Eun Yuri so favorably.
