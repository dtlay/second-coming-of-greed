(2)", "content": ["Same time.", "A woman and two men were looking down at the battlefield from a mountain ridge.", "The woman, wearing a thick coat, was the Star of Sloth, Taciana Cinzia.", "And the two men next to her were each the Star of Pride and the Star of Wrath.", "\u201cIya~! That\u2019s a pretty sweet first attack!\u201d", "A burly man carrying a greatsword on his back, the Executor of Ira, could not hide his astonishment.", "The cavalry led by Teresa was one-sidedly slaughtering the corpse army.", "However, Cinzia was apathetic as she chewed on the cigarette in her mouth.", "While it was true that the cavalry was on the winning end, at the end of the day, the enemy was only the corpse army, the cannon fodder of the Parasites.", "The enemy\u2019s main force had yet to make a move.", "\u201cI doubt the Parasites will stay still\u2026\u201d", "Thinking the same as Cinzia, the Star of Pride gazed at the enemy camp attentively.", "At that moment, the three Executors noticed a change.", "The holographic image in the sky was swaying greatly. Within the undulating screen, the Parasite Queen was shouting something while shaking.", "They couldn\u2019t hear her due to being so far away, but judging from her appearance\u2026", "\u201cWhat? She\u2019s angry?\u201d", "The Star of Wrath spoke with widened eyes.", "However, this was only the start of the change.", "Immediately after they saw the Parasite Queen\u2019s rage, the enemy\u2019s movements fell into disarray. No, should he say the Parasites became urgent?", "\u201cThe Nests are throbbing at a faster rate. The mother species are also reproducing twice as fast as before.\u201d", "The Executor of Superbia, the god overseeing the Archer class, quickly relayed the situation.", "\u201cIt looks like they\u2019re going to start an all-out war\u2026\u201d", "Soon, his prediction was proven to be spot on.", "\u201cThe Army Commanders are coming!\u201d", "With the undead army of Unsightly Humility leading the way, a total of four Army Commanders began to move.", "The burly man\u2019s jaw dropped.", "The Succubus and Banshee army flew up simultaneously, and beneath them, Blood Golems chased after the Death Knights with loud thumps.", "Not to mention, all sorts of parasites dashed out of the Parasites\u2019 camp.", "Just like he said, the Parasites were starting an all-out attack.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t this\u2026 strange?\u201d", "While the burly man was at a loss for words, the Star of Pride furrowed his brows.", "\u201cEven with the three of us here, the Parasites should still have the advantage. I doubt the Parasite Queen is oblivious to this.\u201d", "He then glanced sideways.", "\u201cSo why is she suddenly like this?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Who knows?\u201d", "Cinzia pulled out the cigarette in her mouth and let out a long puff of smoke.", "\u201cMaybe she\u2019s grown tired of playing house and is planning on ending this once and for all.\u201d", "Even as she spoke dismissively, she turned her gaze and looked down at the paper in her left hand.", "It was then.", "\u201cUuuuuhh!!\u201d", "The burly man screamed.", "Unsightly Humility\u2019s army was about to clash with humanity\u2019s well-aligned cavalry.", "Then\u2026", "\u201cThey passed through!?\u201d", "Without pouncing on the cavalry, they instantly turned translucent and phased through them.", "Fluidization. It was one of Unsightly Humility\u2019s Authorities\u2014 being able to turn his army into a state between liquid and gas.", "Because of this, the second round of boomerang blades fired under Arbor Muto\u2019s command missed, and the cavalrymen, who were determined to die fighting, were left in the dirt.", "That wasn\u2019t all. Vulgar Chastity and Exploding Patience\u2019s armies also passed by humanity\u2019s reinforcements. Even the Blood Golems took a roundabout way to avoid the human army.", "The confused cavalry tried to stop the Parasites\u2019 advance, but they had no choice but to watch the Parasite army leave as they were attacked immediately by the parasites that flew in after them.", "The main armies that had passed by the cavalry only had one destination \u2014 Tigol Fortress.", "Cinzia\u2019s eyes narrowed. Looking at the Parasites\u2019 decision in an isolated space, it wasn\u2019t all that strange.", "But just like what the Star of Pride said, their sudden change in tactics was something to question.", "\u201cUh\u2026\u201d", "The burly man blinked rapidly.", "\u201cIs this the end?\u201d", "He didn\u2019t know how many Thunders were left in the fortress, but there was a good chance that he was correct.", "The earlier battle had left the Federation\u2019s forces weakened and battered. While it was true that hundreds of Nests were supporting the attacking parasites and corpse army, the Federation could only barely hold their ground against them.", "There was simply no way they could last against the simultaneous all-out attack of the four Army Commanders\u2019 armies.", "Not unless the World Tree came back to life this instant.", "And thus, Tigol Fortress fell into a perilous situation once again.", "The silently watching Cinzia slowly raised her left hand.", "Observatio Vitae, a contract that reveals the life of its pledger.", "The contract that Teresa gave her was in a pitiful state. There wasn\u2019t a single moment where it wasn\u2019t burning hot. There were multiple instances where Cinzia was worried it would burn out completely.", "The smoldering paper had burned away until it reached the size of a thumb. But since then, it had returned to its original clean appearance, no longer burning.", "If Seol Jihu had died, this contract would have become a handful of ash. The fact that it recovered revealed that he was safe.", "And so, it wasn\u2019t all that difficult to piece together what must have happened in the Spirit Realm.", "\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201d", "The sudden change in the Parasites\u2019 actions and the recovery of the contract were more than enough evidence.", "The Parasite Queen was enraged, and the Parasites started an all-out attack. The four Army Commanders also led their armies to the battlefield, even passing by the human reinforcements as if they didn\u2019t exist.", "It was almost as if they were chased on time.", "In such a situation, what significance would the contract returning to its original appearance represent? The answer was obvious.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Of course, there was currently no reason for Cinzia to participate in the war.", "The condition for her joining the war had yet to be confirmed. In other words, the World Tree had not revived.", "However, Cinzia was no fool. She had more than enough insight to know what would happen to the Federation and then humanity once Tigol Fortress fell.", "She also knew what position the Federation and humanity would hold if the World Tree revived and they successfully defeated the Parasites.", "And thus, Cinzia realized that she was at a crossroads of extreme significance.", "Although it might not overturn the general trend, she was struck with the premonition that her choice would affect it greatly.", "\u201cHa.\u201d", "And the moment this thought crossed her mind, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.", "The fact that she had this thought showed that she saw a sliver of hope in this situation. The progress of the war had changed her previous thought, \u2018It won\u2019t matter even if I join the war.\u2019", "[I just wanted you to know\u2026]", "Suddenly recalling what Teresa said to her, Cinzia grinned.", "[That is the only hope we have left.]", "Whether it be the only hope or the final chance, she acknowledged it in the end.", "\u201cWell\u2026 I guess I was looking forward to it ever since I let Agnes go.\u201d", "Cinzia smacked her lips and put the folded contract into her pocket. Then, she spoke.", "\u201cI have a question.\u201d", "The two Executors turned to her simultaneously.", "\u201cSuppose you\u2019re playing a card game and you\u2019re about to lose. But if you hold out just a bit, you\u2019re guaranteed to get the card that will reverse the situation. What would you do?\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cWill you give up? Or wait just a little longer?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re asking us that, but I would wait.\u201d", "\u201cI see. I thought as much.\u201d", "The Star of Pride replied casually at the sudden question. On the other hand, the burly man furrowed his brows.", "\u201cWhat are you talking about? What are you gonna do about that?\u201d", "\u201cWhat am I gonna do?\u201d", "Cinzia smirked and twirled her left index finger.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d", "Then, she quickly chanted a spell.", "The two Executors, who blinked their eyes in confusion, quickly did a double-take and turned their gazes up.", "An enormous magic circle was forming above Cinzia\u2019s head.", "Of course, it was on top of their heads as well.", "The Star of Pride muttered in shock.", "\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "Cinzia shrugged and spoke.", "\u201cI\u2019ll explain later.\u201d", "At the same time, the magic circle spun and descended on the three Executors.", "Teleportation was activated.", "**", "Unsightly Humility charged forward.", "From the moment he set out as the vanguard, he ignored all else and only rushed forward.", "The creeping apprehension in the corner of his heart refused to disappear.", "What Exploding Patience said was not wrong. The Parasite Queen was not emotional in making her decisions. She must have had a reason for urging the capture of the fortress.", "Worried that this reason was related to that frightening demon, Unsightly Humility steeled his resolve.", "The Parasite Queen possessed an indomitable personality and always made cool-headed assessments of the situation.", "She was especially like so in war.", "If she did not see a chance of victory, she would have ordered them to retreat without a moment of hesitation. The fact that she ordered an all-out attack meant that they still had a chance.", "Once his thoughts reached this point, Unsightly Humility emptied his mind completely.", "From this point onward, there was only one thing he needed to do.", "He was approaching the fortress wall.", "There was no need to break it.", "He could simply phase through it.", "Then, he\u2019d climb up to the command post, and\u2014", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "It was then.", "With only about a hundred meters left to the fortress gate, a magic circle suddenly appeared in front of him. At the same time, the circle instantaneously multiplied to several hundred.", "Before Unsightly Humility could do anything about it, Battle Maidens shot up from each magic circle. They instantly got into a formation and simultaneously rushed toward Unsightly Humility!", "\u201c!\u201d", "The greatly astonished Unsightly Humility swung his longsword in a hurry.", "Although he fended off a couple of the Valkyries flying at him, soon he had no choice but to pull the reins of his mount as the Death Knights that clashed with the Battle Maidens all fell down or were knocked backward.", "Hearing the cries of the spectral horses ringing out in his surroundings, Unsightly Humility looked straight ahead.", "He then shut his mouth, seeing the woman standing in front of the gate, adorning a thick coat.", "\u201c\u2026I did not think you were so foolish.\u201d", "Pretending to be calm, Unsightly Humility clattered his teeth.", "\u201cDo you truly believe stopping me at this point will accomplish anything?\u201d", "\u201cWould I be here if I didn\u2019t?\u201d", "As Cinzia retorted glibly, Unsightly Humility fixed his grip on his longsword.", "\u201cHow arrogant of you. Did you forget about your pitiful defeat in the valley war?\u201d", "\u201cHow could I?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t see your Servant from back then either\u2026 I wonder where your confidence is coming from.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t bring her on purpose. She just can\u2019t be here right now.\u201d", "Smiling blandly, Cinzia called the Valkyries and got into a formation again.", "\u201cWell, I\u2019m thankful that you\u2019re worried about my intelligence. But it isn\u2019t as if I\u2019m lacking in learning ability.\u201d", "Unsightly Humility flinched just as he was about to rush forward. It was because Cinzia raised her arms and pointed left and right.", "Immediately afterward, two men landed on the ground next to her.", "It was the Star of Pride and the Star of Wrath.", "\u201cI figured I wasn\u2019t enough, so I called these two over\u2026 What do you think? Is this enough to satisfy you?\u201d", "Cinzia winked and then revealed her teeth in a grin.", "\u201c\u2026Damn it, you better give a proper explanation later, Taciana Cinzia.\u201d", "The young man wearing a hat gritted his teeth and nocked a chained arrow to his bow.", "\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m sure a woman as calculating as you, has a good reason.\u201d", "The burly man also had a slightly dumbstruck expression, but he soon pulled out the greatsword on his back.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Clack, clack, clack. The clattering of teeth rang out once again.", "\u201c\u2026There are other Army Commanders as well.\u201d", "Although he spoke calmly, his expression slowly darkened.", "For some reason, the gears that should be turning in perfect sync seemed to be twisting out of place at every important moment.", "\u201cYou\u2019re too late!\u201d", "Tang! Gabriel slammed down on the fortress wall as she looked down.", "She was in conflict watching Unsightly Humility relentlessly charging forth. Just as she was about to explode from frustration at the Executors\u2019 refusal to act, they finally made a move.", "She let out the breath she had been holding in as she saw them appear in front of the fortress wall, but the feeling of relief only lasted a moment.", "Soon, she opened her eyes sharply and looked up at the sky.", "Unsightly Humility might have stopped, but he wasn\u2019t the only Army Commander present.", "Abhorrent Charity was following closely behind him, and more importantly, Vulgar Chastity and Exploding Patience were unhindered as they flew across the sky.", "The only silver lining in this situation was that they could use the few remaining Thunders for an aerial interception.", "And so, just as she was about to order the attack, a Sky Fairy rushed up to her.", "\u201cU-Urgent news!\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it!?\u201d", "Gabriel reacted temperamentally from being on the edge.", "The Sky Fairy winced but soon continued with a clear voice.", "\u201cHumanity\u2019s troops have arrived at the rear gate of the fortress! There are hundreds of soldiers, and a person proclaiming to be the queen of Eva has requested to be let in!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "Gabriel\u2019s voice softened slightly.", "The Sky Fairy quickly wrapped up her explanation as Gabriel knit her brows.", "\u201cShe\u2019ll carry\u2026 what in?\u201d", "**", "\u201cThere we go.\u201d", "Roselle suddenly spoke as she looked up at the sky.", "Eun Yuri, who was sitting cross-legged in meditation, opened her eyes.", "\u201cReally, Teacher?\u201d", "\u201cYes, I\u2019m positive.\u201d", "Roselle pointed up at the sky.", "\u201cLook. The star that turned red from the invasion is regaining its blue hue.\u201d", "Eun Yuri nodded her head in a daze.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy for a dead star to come back to life.\u201d", "Roselle smiled brightly.", "\u201cRegaining its light in such a splendid fashion can only mean that the World Tree grew to adulthood and regained control of the Spirit Realm. The Spirits must have recovered their strength and come back to life by now.\u201d", "Eun Yuri\u2019s complexion brightened.", "\u201cThen!\u201d", "\u201cAll that\u2019s remaining is connecting to the Middle World.\u201d", "Roselle shook her head, unable to hide her admiration.", "\u201cIncredible. Truly incredible. To think they\u2019d really succeed\u2026\u201d", "Then, she suddenly tilted her head.", "\u201cBut it\u2019s strange. Given the situation you described, it should have been near impossible to achieve. Not unless the Parasites did something completely brainless\u2026\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t as if Roselle didn\u2019t have questions, but success was still a success.", "With this, the conditions that were out of their control were all met.", "All that remained was for them to do what was within their control.", "Taking her eyes off of the sky, Roselle looked back at Eun Yuri. She had already gotten up and was collecting her breath.", "\u201cYuri, your body and the stele\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThey should have arrived at Tigol Fortress by now.\u201d", "\u201cCharlotte must have done a good job.\u201d", "Roselle stretched.", "\u201cGreat. This teacher will make contact with the World Tree. You should go back and prepare.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yes!\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. Just do as you learned, and this teacher will take care of the rest. Fufu.\u201d", "With a soft laugh, Roselle\u2019s eyes turned hazy.", "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it~ You see, my competitive spirit has been burning since I heard about them. I wanted to fight and see just how strong they are\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cFufu, that\u2019s not all. Those sons of bitches destroyed the revenge plan I prepared for hundreds of years\u2014! Hehehehe!\u201d", "Her eyes flashed as she cackled sinisterly.", "Eun Yuri shrunk back but also nodded. At least for today, Roselle\u2019s madness-filled eyes felt incredibly reliable.", "\u201cOh my, pardon my language. My true feelings came out, hoho.\u201d", "Roselle snapped out of her momentary madness and gave a ladylike laugh.", "She then raised her hands as she stared at the anxiously standing Eun Yuri.", "\u201cNow then.\u201d", "As her two hands came together in a quick clap, Roselle gave a cute wink.", "\u201cSee you in the Middle World!\u201d", "Then.", "Chak!", "The moment she clapped\u2014", "\u201c\u2026!\u201d", "Eun Yuri\u2019s eyes shot open."]}
