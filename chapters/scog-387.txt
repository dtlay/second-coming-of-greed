You almost got caught?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cSince I\u2019ve been here once before, it wasn\u2019t difficult to set the coordinates correctly. But when I tried to teleport, mana flooded in from this building, trying to hinder my spell\u2026 I would have been found out if I was even a few seconds late.\u201d", "\u201cFrom the building\u2026? That means\u2026\u201d", "\u201cEun Yuri, was it? It should be her, one of the Magician Trio who\u2019s been hanging out with Delphine recently. Anyway, she must have sensed something because she scattered her mana around every nook and cranny of the building.\u201d", "Philip Muller smirked.", "\u201cWhat a cheeky girl. A Magician, who\u2019s not even a High Ranker, trying to compete against a Unique Ranker who\u2019s an apostle of god\u2026\u201d", "\u201cSo something like that happened\u2026 Maybe I should have let Miss Eun Yuri know.\u201d", "\u201cNo, it was unexpected for me too. And to be honest \u2014 it was fun. I don\u2019t know about you Warriors, but we Magicians have our own fights. Thanks to her, my blood started boiling after a long time.\u201d", "Philip Muller\u2019s voice carried a subtle pride. It seemed he considered this \u2018fight\u2019 a victory since he managed to teleport in without being discovered.", "\u201cAnyway, a Magician of her caliber should have a different way of thinking than most people. From what Delphine\u2019s told me, she\u2019s pursuing the limits of the Path of Mana. If given the chance, I\u2019d love to meet and discuss theories with her.\u201d", "Given Philip Muller\u2019s personality, it was rare to see him show so much interest in someone.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s expression turned odd.", "\u201cShould I arrange a meeting between you two? I can lend a hand if you want.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m trying to discuss theories, not romance.\u201d", "He refused firmly.", "\u201cI\u2019d love to meet her as a Magician, but she seems like a dangerous woman to be involved with as a man. You better be careful too.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Miss Eun Yuri?\u201d", "\u201cShe must have been annoyed that I didn\u2019t fall for the trap, so she started searching through the entire city like a crazy woman. It really wasn\u2019t something to react so badly for\u2026 It was like she was chasing after me with a knife.\u201d", "Philip murmured the last sentence.", "\u201cPlus, I have a wife. If I want to live a long life, I have to be careful.\u201d", "\u201cEh? You\u2019re married?\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? My Servant is my wife. We didn\u2019t register for marriage or anything, but we\u2019ve been living together for five years in Paradise, so we\u2019re practically a married couple.\u201d", "Philip Muller snorted as he pushed his glasses up. He looked like he didn\u2019t know why he had to explain all this.", "\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s quit the small talk and cut to the chase.\u201d", "\u201cGot it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu walked toward the desk. Knowing Philip Muller\u2019s personality, he started talking as soon as he sat down on the opposite side.", "\u201cThere are Paradisians and Earthlings within humanity\u2019s camp that are communicating with the Parasites.\u201d", "Philip Muller flinched.", "Seol Jihu crossed his legs and placed his interlocked fingers on his knee.", "\u201cI\u2019d like to ask for Mister Muller\u2019s opinion regarding this matter.\u201d", "Only now did Philip Muller take his eyes off his book. He stared at Seol Jihu with a subdued gaze.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re asking me all of a sudden, but\u2026\u201d", "He stared for some time before slowly retorting.", "\u201cI\u2019ll give my answer first. I don\u2019t think there are traitors within humanity\u2019s camp.\u201d", "Seol Jihu widened his eyes at the unexpected response.", "\u201cI thought for sure that you\u2019d agree\u2026 Can I ask why you think so?\u201d", "\u201cI thought so too originally with 90 percent certainty. But I changed my mind after the Arden Valley War.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThink about the condition that Undying Diligence put forth after he and the Parasite Army arrived at the valley.\u201d", "Seol Jihu slowly searched through his memories.", "It was something that happened almost ten years ago, but the memory quickly came back with how shocking it was.", "[Amongst you should be a human who recently began to make a name for himself.]", "[If you hand over that person\u2026 we will go back quietly. I shall promise with my name.]", "Once Seol Jihu shut his mouth, Philip Muller started talking again.", "\u201cUndying Diligence was talking about you. The Valley War, the Delphinion Laboratory Incident, the Banquet\u2026 you were the only one who started making a name for himself back then.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head, and Philip Muller continued.", "\u201cThe thing to note is that Undying Diligence did not know your name. It\u2019s hard to believe the Parasites didn\u2019t care when they went so far as to bring three of their armies to battle, and it also doesn\u2019t make sense that they would say something like that if they already knew. It\u2019s not like it was difficult to distinguish you, so why didn\u2019t they know?\u201d", "Seol Jihu understood what Philip Muller was getting at. If there were traitors amidst humanity\u2019s camp, there was no way the Parasites wouldn\u2019t have known this information. After all, with how easy it was to characterize him, the traitors would have revealed his name.", "\u201cSo it\u2019s highly likely that there were no traitors at the time that were directly communicating with the Parasites. But\u2014\u201d", "At that moment, Philip Muller came in with a huge \u2018but\u2019.", "\u201cWhether it be the past or present, I do believe there are Earthlings or Paradisians that are trying to defect to the Parasites. This, I\u2019m sure of.\u201d", "Meaning, there were people who were willing to betray humanity if given the opportunity.", "The immature, young Seol Jihu wouldn\u2019t have understood why.", "He would have angrily yelled asking how Earthlings could do something that directly went against their duty.", "But he was different now.", "Seol Jihu easily acknowledged what Philip Muller said and smiled.", "\u201cI guess there are people trying to flatter the winning side no matter where you go.\u201d", "\u201cPeople trying to flatter the winning side\u2026 That\u2019s a good way to put it.\u201d", "Philip Muller laughed blandly before turning serious again.", "\u201cThe problem is that Paradise isn\u2019t a sporting event that you pay a fee to enter.\u201d", "\u201cYes, it\u2019s a deathmatch that doesn\u2019t stop until one side perishes completely.\u201d", "\u201cExactly. To be honest, most Earthlings are probably hoping the status quo continues. Parasites leaving humanity alone and only fighting with the Federation, and the Federation barely hanging on.\u201d", "Because only then would Paradise continue to need Earthlings.", "\u201cBut there is no way this status quo will go on forever. In fact, if it wasn\u2019t for you, it would have changed long ago. Arden Valley would have been taken over; Haramark, which serves as the outpost of humanity, would have been conquered by mass-produced mutant orcs; and Eva would probably be hanging on by a thread\u2026 Humanity would have been counting down to their doom.\u201d", "Philip Muller said after a short pause.", "\u201cThankfully, things aren\u2019t so bad right now. But\u2026 in the end, Earthlings will have to make a decision one day. To fight, to escape to Earth, or\u2026\u201d", "\u201cJump to the Parasites\u2019 side and continue their activities in Paradise.\u201d", "As Seol Jihu finished the sentence, Philip Muller nodded his head. He then crossed his arms as if he said everything he had to say.", "Now, it was time to reveal the reason he asked. Seol Jihu organized his thoughts before starting.", "\u201cWhen I moved from Haramark to Eva\u2026 I made three vows.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s voice was low and calm.", "\u201cThe first was to clean up the deeply-rooted corruption inside Eva. The second was to improve humanity\u2019s relationship with the Federation. And the third\u2026 was to change humanity.\u201d", "Philip Muller listened to Seol Jihu quietly.", "\u201cAt present, I can confidently say the first and second goals have been met. But I haven\u2019t achieved the third goal yet.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cTo tell you the truth, at first, I thought things would change if I just worked hard to set an example for others. But that was the wrong expectation to have. Humanity has never had a proper fight with the Parasites, yet they were more afraid than they needed to be. This perception hasn\u2019t changed even though we won the last battle.\u201d", "\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s true that the Parasites are a powerful enemy.\u201d", "Philip Muller sighed.", "\u201cIt\u2019s true that we won the last battle as you said, but anyone with some thought would know not to be so optimistic about the future course of the war. In fact, they would be pessimistic.\u201d", "\u201cI think so too. We could only push them back in Tigol Fortress where we had an overwhelming advantage. And something like that won\u2019t happen ever again.\u201d", "\u201cThe people looking for an opportunity to defect probably don\u2019t think well of you. Because the Parasites will pay more attention to humanity with how much you\u2019ve busted them up.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s voice grew slightly louder.", "\u201cAs you said, Earthlings will have to make a decision one day. That day may not have come yet, but I\u2019m sure everyone feels that it\u2019s closer than ever before.\u201d", "\u201cAnd?\u201d", "\u201cSo wouldn\u2019t there be more antsy traitors as well?\u201d", "Philip Muller furrowed his brows like he didn\u2019t understand.", "\u201cWhat are you trying to get at?\u201d", "\u201cMm, going back a little bit.\u201d", "Seol Jihu cleared his throat, thinking that a more detailed explanation was needed.", "\u201cThe Parasite Queen has left humanity alone all this time. Compared to how they\u2019ve dealt with the Federation, they\u2019ve practically been ignoring humanity. But if you take a closer look, that isn\u2019t necessarily the case.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stretched out his arm.", "Chwak! A pile of records flew into his hand.", "\u201cMaster Ian personally compiled these records. Try giving them a read.\u201d", "Seol Jihu handed the pile over.", "Soon, Philip Muller\u2019s eyes slowly widened as he flipped through the pages.", "He could see many familiar names.", "Al Zahra, Alvaro Skroke, Eleanor Luna, Joshua Claflin\u2026 They were all Earthlings who were once renowned in Paradise. The important thing was that they were no longer in Paradise.", "\u201cOf course, I\u2019m sure some of those incidents were caused by the conflict between Earthlings. But\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThere are incidents that the Parasites had a hand in.\u201d", "\u201cYes. And if you focus on that, you\u2019ll see something in common that\u2019s very interesting.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke.", "\u201cThe Parasite Queen hasn\u2019t been ignoring humanity. She understood Earthlings better than anyone else, and she acted accordingly, throwing hints to incite certain situations.\u201d", "\u201cExplain.\u201d", "\u201cCould it be that there was no one more outstanding than me among the countless Earthlings that came to Paradise? No, I don\u2019t think so. But the problem is this. Whenever a hero appears and tries to do something, the Parasite Queen would appear.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAnd she quickly dispatched the hero. Whether it be killing them like with Joshua Claflin, corrupting them and forcing them to defect like with Marika Larisa, or coaxing them to join like with Sung Shihyun.\u201d", "Right, the Parasites hadn\u2019t neglected humanity.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that the first ranked didn\u2019t care about the third ranked.
