I wanna hug!\u2019", "It was to the point where he was confident that even if he went \u2018Screw this! I\u2019m hugging her!\u2019 and embraced her, Seo Yuhui would only let out a helpless sigh and forgive him.", "'What the fuck am I thinking?'", "While he ended up not doing anything as even he believed his thoughts were retarded, Seol Jihu was completely bewildered.", "Was it weird if he felt like his body was automatically reacting?", "He could almost understand why Chohong and Hugo ran away; there wasn\u2019t anything harder than the situation he was in.", "Upon sneaking a glance at the fine neckline of Seo Yuhui who was hard at work, Seol Jihu moaned inside and forcibly tore his gaze away.", "And as he did so, a sack placed in the corner of the room came into view.

Ingredients, huh. I almost thought\u2026\u201d", "\"Thought what?\"", "\u201cThere were all sorts of weird rumors because of these sacks.\u201d", "\u201cReally? They\u2019re really just ingredients\u2026 You can check them yourself.\u201d", "Urged by curiosity, Seol Jihu opened the sacks and found familiar things inside.", "They were normal food ingredients no matter how he saw.", "\u2018She is right.\u2019", "He had thought there would be something special inside. Receiving the answer to the question he had had for a while, his anxiety dropped significantly.", "\u201cThe residents of Ramman Village settled down faster than I expected.

That after solving the unsolvable mystery of the Ramman Village, you turned down the gold bar and asked the king to use it for the residents instead?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s cheeks flushed.", "Whether she did or didn\u2019t know Seol Jihu\u2019s complicated mind, Seo Yuhui happily chirped on.", "\u201cNormal Earthlings would find it hard to make such a decision. You must really be\u2026 a kind person.\u201d", "He stopped breathing.

Although it wasn\u2019t a big deal, it definitely felt as if he was at an important \u2018fork\u2019 in the road.", "Seol Jihu who had been standing there stunned with his hands on his chest, \"\u2026No.\"", "He unconsciously spoke out.", "\"That\u2019s not it.\"", "A slightly hoarse voice.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s eyes widened at the three consecutive denials.", "It wasn\u2019t out of humbleness; it was what Seol Jihu really thought.", "Thinking back, he felt like this ever since the Forest of Denial\u2014 no, since the Neutral Zone.", "Every time people around him praised and raised him up for being kind and amazing, he had felt an unexplainable sense of burden and discomfort.", "Seo Yuhui asked.", "\"What do you mean?\"", "\"\u2026I don\u2019t know.\"", "Seol Jihu let out a deep sigh. He knew he was speaking gibberish, but once he tried to explain, no words came out.", "Only, while it could have been his misunderstanding, he felt as if Seo Yuhui was expecting a certain \u2018image\u2019 of him, and he wanted to just say that he wasn\u2019t it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just that the sins I\u2019ve committed\u2026 they\u2019re too much to count.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bit his lips.", "\u201cI wanted to lessen the guilt I was feeling\u2026\u201d", "He continued on as if he was lamenting.", "\u201cAnd I hoped that if I kept living right, I might be forgiven one day\u2026\u201d", "Even while knowing it wasn\u2019t going to happen.", "Seol Jihu bitterly pursed his lips.", "\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not a good person.\u201d", "Seol Jihu realized he slipped up after saying that.", "What fault did she have? It wasn\u2019t that they were complete strangers, but he had unconsciously spilled out all his worries to her.", "Seo Yuhui no longer had the gentle smile on her face. She was staring at him with sunken eyes.", "Her fine lips slightly parted as if she was going to say something before closing them again.", "Feeling her quiet eyes penetrate through him, Seol Jihu lowered his head.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "He began to concentrate on cleaning, feeling like he had spoken unnecessarily.", "The conversation that had awkwardly ended only resumed when they were almost done tidying up the room.", "\"Are you free tomorrow too?\"", "Seo Yuhui was making an ambiguous smile like the one Mona Lisa had.

The new recruits are going to receive training from Master Jang.\u201d", "Then a second later, Seo Yuhui\u2019s eyes widened.", "\"Oh my! Huge Stone Rocky Mountain?\u201d", "\"Huh? Yes.\"", "\"That\u2019s great!\"", "Lightly clapping her hands, she requested to accompany him after explaining that she too had things she had to do at the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a danger zone after all. I\u2019m not too comfortable going alone so it\u2019s fine even if you view it as an official request from me.\u201d", "\"Ah, it\u2019s okay.\"", "Seol Jihu easily accepted after hearing her situation.", "\u201cWe\u2019re planning to be there for a while anyways. Since our destinations are the same, let\u2019s go together.\u201d", "He accepted her request because having her could only be beneficial to them.", "\u2018But wasn\u2019t she supposed to be a High Ranker?\u2019", "After Seo Yuhui saw him off, a suspicion arose in Seol Jihu\u2019s mind. But he quickly brushed off the thought, reminding himself of her occupation as a priest which was known for its poor combat abilities.", "As expected, Jang Maldong did not refuse but rather welcomed her.", "He wondered what someone like her would have to do in a mountain, but he did not dig further into it as it was her personal business.", "The next day.", "The Carpe Diem team boarded a carriage headed for the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain with Seo Yuhui who had come wearing a neat set of robes.", "The company was originally composed of five people, but with the addition of Phi Sora who decided to come at the last minute, the sum added up to six.", "*", "As soon as they arrived, Seol Jihu immediately headed towards the hideout that the village chief had told him before.", "They were planning to stay for at least a couple weeks, and it was difficult to find a better place to use as a base camp than there.", "The cave was occupied by six Cave Ettins, but they were all massacred by Seol Jihu who suddenly attacked them.", "The siblings shouted in surprise seeing the six monsters sent to their deaths with exactly six spear strikes.", "They knew he wasn\u2019t normal, but they didn\u2019t imagine that the skill gap between them was this big considering that they were all from the same year.", "Jang Maldong who was proudly watching from the side commented, \u201cThis is what I expected the first time we came,\u201d before proceeding to take off his gear and prepare for the upcoming training.", "\u2018Finally.\u2019", "It was time for training.", "As Seol Jihu was stretching his body while restraining his explosive desire to train, Jang Maldong approached him.", "The training was officially for the siblings, but Jang Maldong\u2019s first priority was always Seol Jihu.", "\u201cI think I can finally see the direction of your growth.\u201d", "Jang Maldong opened his mouth.", "\u201cIt\u2019s speed.\u201d", "\"Speed?\"", "\u201cYes. Especially considering your Festina Earring, Flash Step, etc. I find it highly likely that your fundamental combat style will center around on your speed. Try to think how you took down the Orc Champion.\u201d", "\u201cMaster. Then my Flash Thunder\u2026\u201d", "\"Don\u2019t be too hasty.\"", "Jang Maldong bluntly interrupted.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a little better now, but the incongruity between your mind, technique, and body still exists. Like I\u2019ve said several times, your priority should be harmonizing these three elements. Your body needs to be able to house your tsunami-like mana in order to\u2026\u201d", "Jang Maldong went on explaining for a while before suddenly turning his gaze. He saw Seo Yuhui wholeheartedly taking notes beside them.", "\u201cSo that\u2019s why. While his growth speed is fast, there is an incongruity between his mind, technique, and body\u2026 especially his mana\u2026\u201d", "She could be seen lightly nodding her head and even biting the end of her pen while deep in thought.", "\u201cAh. I almost made a mistake now that I think about it\u2026 If I had given him that drink yesterday, then his mana would have\u2026 I assumed that his base mana stat was low because he was a warrior but\u2026 Hmm\u2026 Then instead of raising his mana, I should feed him things that will enhance his physique\u2026\u201d", "And as if she felt the gazes on herself, she stopped her murmurs and raised her head.", "She waved off her hands seeing the two men stare at her.", "\u201cOh. Please don\u2019t mind me.\u201d", "\"\u2026.Well, to explain a little further.\"", "After letting out a dry cough, Jang Maldong turned towards Seol Jihu and continued.", "\u201cWhile speed is important in battle, power is also important. Flash Thunder can be viewed as an Awakening Skill that combines these two factors. The important part is that your originally attributeless mana will be imbued with the lightning attribute.\u201d", "He lifted his index finger and pointed it at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWhat comes to your mind when you see lightning strikes?\u201d", "\"That it\u2019s fast\u2026 and powerful\u2026.\"", "\"You\u2019re right. The lightning essence is one that boasts extreme speed and almost perversely strong power. It suits you in a way, and is almost tailor-made for a warrior.\u201d", "Jang Maldong continued speaking solemnly.", "\u201cThe point is that you have to make a body capable of enduring the extreme speed, allowing you to then pursue the power that comes along with it.\u201d", "Flash like lightning, and strike like thunder.", "He had the speed, but his control over it was weak. Power came afterwards.", "After pondering for a while, Seol Jihu asked.", "\u201cMaster, I may be going ahead of myself, but how do I change my attribute?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d", "Jang Maldong crossed his arms.", "\u201cAlong with everything I\u2019ve mentioned before, you must prepare to evolve your Mana Cultivation.\u201d", "\"Mana Cultivation?\"", "\u201cYes. Beyond simply gathering the mana in the atmosphere, the cultivation technique must be able to gather lightning energy, allowing you to utilize it.\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu at a loss for words, Jang Maldong smirked.", "\u201cYou little punk. Haven\u2019t I warned you before? Your training path is going to be full of thorns.\u201d", "He knew, but he stuck out his tongue as he didn\u2019t expect it to be this hard.", "\u2018When do I finish all of this\u2026\u2019", "His future seemed bleak as the premonition that he might have to spend his whole life training dawned on him, but Seol Jihu adjusted his mind and steeled himself.", "Even a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.", "No. He couldn\u2019t even take the first step yet.", "One had to have durable shoes to complete the thousand-mile journey.", "Whether it was the Flash Step, Intuition, or the Festina Earring, he couldn\u2019t properly use any of the skills he possessed. It was greedy for him to desire higher abilities at this point.", "\u201cSo how is it? It\u2019s not too late to back out yet\u2026\u201d", "The smirking Jang Maldong paused again and turned his gaze.", "\u201cLightning\u2026 Lightning\u2026. Right. Luckily I still have the Essence of Soma\u2026?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui rapidly blinked her eyes and quietly turned away to stare at a faraway peak.", "Shrugging his shoulders, Jang Maldong passed a thick rope to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cTie it around your waist.\u201d", "Seol Jihu slightly smiled, seeing the heavy logs tied on the other end of the rope.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not normal running anymore, huh?\u201d", "\u201cWe came all the way here so I\u2019ve at least got to make you do this.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say anything else and tied the rope tightly around his waist.", "\u201cDo I practice the Thrust, Strike, and Cut afterwards?\u201d", "\u201cHuhu. Try if you can. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d", "\"Alright! I\u2019ll be back!\u201d", "Without further ado, Seol Jihu dashed off.", "Keutongtongtong!", "Wincing at the loud rattling of the logs, Jang Maldong turned to the siblings who were standing straight on the side.", "\u201cYou remember what I\u2019ve told you before, right?\u201d", "The two nodded.", "Jang Maldong pointed his chin at the now far away silhouette of Seol Jihu.", "\u201cChase after him.\u201d", "In the next moment, the siblings started running after the young man.", "\u201cSungjin, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah raised her speed, leaving her brother behind who was tiredly going up the hill.", "\u201cN-Noona?\u201d", "She didn\u2019t slow down despite hearing Yi Sungjin\u2019s shout.", "Yi Seol-Ah wasn\u2019t stupid. Rather, she wasn\u2019t any less smart than Yun Seora.", "Starting with them being able to leave the White Rose, she knew exactly how big of a fortune it was to be directly trained by Jang Maldong.", "It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that any Earthling would wish for.", "'All thanks to Orabeo-nim!'", "As much as this was an opportunity prepared by Seol Jihu, she had no intention of missing out.", "So instead of looking out for her brother, she decided to follow her personal desire and chase after Seol Jihu.", "And above all, running was her specialty among specialties. She had run whenever she had felt down while she was with the White Rose, so she felt confident.", "\u2026But that confidence crashed in less than five minutes.", "No matter how much she tried, the distance between them didn\u2019t decrease at all, but instead grew larger.", "It wasn\u2019t a misconception. Seol Jihu who was running with ten large logs tied behind him was already climbing the peak that marked the first turning point of the course.", "'I-impossible!\u2019", "\"Hak!\"", "Seol Jihu let out a rough breath. His forehead showed signs of sweating, but his face still had a refreshed expression.", "\u2018This is it.\u2019", "Yes, he wanted this.", "To immerse himself in training without worrying about anything else. How long had he waited for this?", "The refreshing wind that blew his hair up made his chest feel lighter.", "\"Haha!\"", "Breaking into laughter, Seol Jihu strongly pushed out his legs.", "*", "Hell training began.", "The training intensity was beyond imagination, causing Yi Seol-Ah to break down in tears in just one day. The next day, Yi Sungjin was on the floor screaming \u2018Kill me now!\u2019 before he was caned by Jang Maldong until he fainted.", "It was painful for Seol Jihu too, but after experiencing it once beforehand, he quietly continued the training.", "The first week served as a warm-up to focus on training the physique.", "The days were simple. Early morning training, followed by breakfast and morning training, followed by lunch and evening training, followed by dinner and night training.", "After everything, Seol Jihu would float on the lake, after which he would return back to the cave to drink a healing potion and sleep.", "And this was repeated after waking up the next day.", "However, one thing had changed after a few days, and this was walking around the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain with Seo Yuhui after his evening training.", "Seo Yuhui had, at first, carefully observed Seol Jihu\u2019s training until she suddenly requested protection during her walks. Seol Jihu accepted without any hesitation.", "It wasn\u2019t bad taking a break for an hour or two after vigorously training the entire day, and besides, among their group only Seol Jihu could help her out.", "The siblings were busy falling down, while Jang Maldong had to oversee their training. Anyway, Seo Yuhui had promised to take care of their meals in compensation for escorting her, so it could only be seen as being profitable.", "In fact, he felt like they were on a date whenever they went out to look for medicinal herbs and flowers, so Seol Jihu secretly waited for Seo Yuhui to call him each day.", "There wasn\u2019t anything special that day.", "After his night training, Seol Jihu had washed himself in the lake and was coming back dripping wet.", "If he hadn\u2019t seen Seo Yuhui waving at him in the distance, he would have gone straight into the cave.", "'?'", "But after approaching her, he found her gesturing for him to come near instead of waving at him.", "As if she wanted him to come to her instead of going into the cave.", "When their eyes met, she placed her index finger on her lips, going \u2018Shhh,\u2019 before retreating backward.", "After tilting his head in confusion, Seol Jihu suddenly flared his nose.", "'This smell\u2026'", "He didn\u2019t know what smell it was, but just a whiff of it made him salivate.", "'What is it?'", "Swallowing his saliva, Seol Jihu moved towards the direction Seo Yuhui had disappeared to.", "'What could it be?'", "His face full of expectation."]}
