I\u2019ll ask them to come to the meeting room when they\u2019re up. You can come then. You know where the meeting room is, right?\u201d", "\u201cDo we need to have a meeting? Just tell me.\u201d", "Kim Hannah laughed, then stared at Seol Jihu. In the next moment, Seol Jihu felt an indescribably strange sensation.", "The craftiness Kim Hannah displayed against Eva\u2019s organizations seemed to pour down on Seol Jihu. The way she gave him an icy look, Kim Hannah almost started to look scary.", "\u201cYou.\u201d", "\u201cWha, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu barely managed to ask\u2026", "\u201c\u2026No.\u201d", "Kim Hannah retracted her gaze and flattened her brows.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Anyway, let\u2019s talk later. I need a few days to see how things develop and to organize my thoughts.\u201d", "With that, she picked up her coffee mug and got up.", "*", "Tang, tang!", "\u201cThese damned bastards!\u201d", "Park Dongchun slammed down on a table, expressing his frustration.", "\u201cThey must think they\u2019re some kind of heroes being so bold!!\u201d", "Snorting hard and his chubby cheeks trembling, Park Dongchun was very clearly enraged.", "\u201cA mere team dares to challenge us, the alliance of organizations? Gooood. If they want to die so much, we\u2019ll grant their wish!\u201d", "\u201cQuiet down.\u201d", "A woman cut him off. Though the voice was calm, a faint hint of frustration could be felt from it. Park Dongchun turned his gaze with an indignant look.", "The Royal Council often had seven representatives participating. As Sombat La-ongmanee, the leader of Royal Pattaya, died a pitiful death, there should be six people present.", "But today, there were seven people in the meeting room, just like before.", "\u201cDo you think I can stay quiet in this situation!?\u201d", "Park Dongchun shot up and shouted.", "\u201cThe VIP auction house was hit clean! The guards were all killed and not even Royal Pattaya was spared!\u201d", "Then suddenly, he grabbed the back of his neck and frowned heavily.", "\u201cThey\u2019re obviously provoking us. They want to fight! Just how much are they looking down on us, the Eva Alliance!?\u201d", "Park Dongchun looked around as if to seek agreement. The meeting room was silent. While everyone had icy expressions, they seemed to be hesitating as well.", "\u201cFight? Oh, please.\u201d", "The woman sitting at the head of the table broke the silence with a nonchalant comment.", "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be the one to say that anyway, Mister Dongchun.\u201d", "Park Dongchun flinched. But then he revealed his teeth and growled.", "\u201cYou think I sold that land just to make some profit? I had my own thoughts! Who would have thought that such a small group of people, who haven\u2019t even finished registering as an organization, would do something like that on their first day in Eva!!?\u201d", "That was true. The Royal Council suspected that Carpe Diem had a reason for coming to Eva and believed that they would do something to shake the status quo.", "The problem was that it came all too fast.", "\u201cEven the royal administrator is going around, making a mess of things\u2026 damn it!\u201d", "Park Dongchun collected his breath, then muttered in a provocative tone.", "\u201cCan\u2019t you do something?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "When a cold reply came back, Park Dongchun gritted his teeth.", "\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know. I\u2019m asking if you can do something about this situation. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m asking if you can help.\u201d", "Hearing Park Dongchun\u2019s almost shamelessly brazen words, the woman snorted dumbfoundedly.", "\u201cWhat do you want me to do in this situation?\u201d", "And her response immediately made Park Dongchun frown.", "\u201cHah, so you\u2019re just going to watch?\u201d", "His sarcastic tone made the woman narrow her eyes.", "\u201cHmph! It\u2019s obvious what you\u2019re thinking about! You\u2019re trying to\u2014\u201d", "\u201cStop, stop.\u201d", "As the atmosphere began to heat up, a brown-skinned, middle-aged man cut in respectably. He was Ochoa Cartel\u2019s boss, Omar Garcia.", "\u201cAren\u2019t we here to discuss and come up with a solution that works for everyone? If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we\u2019ll only be helping the Fox.\u201d", "He then turned to Park Dongchun and spoke.", "\u201cPlease calm down, Leader Park. I understand how you feel, but everyone here is in the same situation. We\u2019re all holding back.\u201d", "Omar Garcia was the one who received the biggest loss from last night\u2019s incident. As slave hunt and trade were his main sources of income, having the VIP auction house destroyed had affected him greatly.", "Park Dongchun let out a dry cough and sat down reluctantly. As Park Dongchun started to cool down, Omar Garcia slowly rekindled the conversation.", "\u201cRoyal Pattaya contacted me late last night\u2026 but it was too late. By the time my subordinates got there, the guards were already encircling the building. The Royal Family was just quicker.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t care what you do, just don\u2019t get caught. Didn\u2019t I make this clear?\u201d", "The woman sitting at the head of the table spoke sharply.", "\u201cThe royal administrator did things on his own, and making this a problem, he asked for an audience with the queen. It\u2019s only a matter of time before she finds out. And when that happens, she is sure to call me to confirm the truth.\u201d", "Muttering unhappily, she looked at the representatives in the room and criticized.", "\u201cHave you given any thought to how difficult you\u2019ll make things for me? Although Eva lost its former glory and became impoverished from the long, drawn-out war, the queen thinks it is still a beautiful, crimeless city otherwise. What do you think she\u2019s going to say when she learns the truth? How dare you speak that way when you\u2019re the ones who caused the problem!?\u201d", "The woman glared in one specific direction, while Park Dongchun stealthily avoided her gaze.", "\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m out of ideas. The royal administrator is managing the matter personally, saying that he\u2019s acting on the queen\u2019s behalf. Nothing we can do will change the law, and the royal administrator already snatched away the tiny methods that might have been available to us.\u201d", "Hearing this, Omar Garcia groaned. The woman continued.", "\u201cIt sounds like he\u2019s really resolved himself this time for the consequences. For now, we should remain quiet and look out for our own interests. No, not should, we must.\u201d", "She emphasized the last point, making a one-sided decision.", "\u201cAlso\u2026\u201d", "Then, she waited a brief moment before licking her lips. Looking around the room and glancing at the other representatives\u2019 faces, she said with hesitation.", "\u201cSoon, I\u2019ll contact you all about something.\u201d", "Omar Garcia, who had a bitter look until now, abruptly shot his eyes open. He wasn\u2019t the only one. The other representatives also gave her surprised looks.", "The woman who rarely showed up to meetings unless something big happened was saying she would contact them first?", "\u201cWhen do you mean by \u2018soon\u2019\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cA week at the earliest, two weeks at the latest.\u201d", "The woman gave a short reply to Omar Garcia\u2019s question.", "\u201cBy then, the decision will be made on how to deal with the currently imprisoned Royal Pattaya members\u2026\u201d", "The woman smacked her lips, seemingly wanting to say more, but she trailed off and shook her head. She was clearly indicating that she\u2019d talk about this again later.", "In truth, it was quite obvious how the rescued foreign races and captured Royal Pattaya members would be dealt with. And no matter what happens, they couldn\u2019t expect the current situation to change greatly.", "\u201c\u2026So.\u201d", "However, Omar Garcia smirked while slowly nodding his head.", "\u201cSo we just have to endure for two weeks.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cGot it. It\u2019s true that our carelessness was part of the problem, and we were going to wait and observe for the next three months anyway.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d recommend you do that as well.\u201d", "\u201cGreat. Then the Ochoa Cartel will do its best to be careful and not to trouble you.\u201d", "Drrk. The sound of a chair being dragged rang out.", "The woman got up from the head of the table and left with big strides, her silky black hair fluttering in the air. As she made her way across the room, Omar Garcia glanced at her shapely butt.", "\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for your call.\u201d", "The woman stopped.", "\u201c\u2026It sounds like you\u2019re grossly misunderstanding this.\u201d", "The woman half-turned her head.", "\u201cThe reason I occasionally participate in these meetings is to keep an eye on you all. Today, I came to give you all a warning. The same goes for why I will be contacting you later.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, of course. I fully understand.\u201d", "Omar Garcia smiled brightly. After saying, \u2018just don\u2019t get caught\u2019, she was now saying it was to keep an eye on them. Omar Garcia found the disparity between the two meanings a bit funny, but he didn\u2019t show it externally.", "The sound of footsteps continued until the door fully shut. After a brief moment of silence, Omar Garcia stretched his arms out.", "\u201cShould we get up too?\u201d", "He spoke with a far more relaxed expression than before.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need me to remind you, but let\u2019s stay on the low for the next week or two, alright?\u201d", "With that, he turned his gaze to Park Dongchun, who was sitting on his chair with a grave expression.", "\u201cAh, Leader Park, you\u2019ve met with Carpe Diem\u2019s leader during the land sale, right? Oh, I\u2019m not trying to pin the blame on you or anything, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d", "Omar Garcia spoke while waving his hand.", "\u201cI was thinking, maybe you should meet with him. After all, you\u2019re already acquainted.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t do it. Just thinking about his ugly face makes me boil. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll start spitting out curses if I see them.\u201d", "\u201cJust go. It\u2019s too early for negotiations or trades anyway. Just mention the idea.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201d", "Park Dongchun was reluctant, but he nodded his head as if he had no choice but to agree.", "\u201cGreat, if you need anything, you\u2019re free to cooperate with White Hwaru.\u201d", "The only remaining woman in the room sighed gravely.", "\u201cGot it. Since I\u2019m at fault, I\u2019ll do what I can. See you next time.\u201d", "Park Dongchun got up helplessly. Tang. The moment he closed the door behind him, the anger staining his face disappeared completely.", "After looking around left and right\u2026", "\u2018YES! I wanted to meet him once anyway!\u2019", "He cheered inwardly and ran excitedly.", "*", "Kim Hannah officially requested a meeting to be held two days later. Her attitude seemed to suddenly change in the cafeteria, but Seol Jihu thought it was his imagination and didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it.", "With not much to do, Seol Jihu stayed cooped up in his room, focusing on mana cultivation.", "Once he began, he usually spent three to four hours on average, but today, he had to cut his training short. It was because an unexpected guest had arrived at the building.", "\u201cIya~ I heard the rumors, but this sure is an impressive building. We thought we did a good job with ours, but now I almost want to rebuild it.\u201d", "The man remarking casually while looking up at the large crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling was Hao Win. He exchanged greetings with Seol Jihu before being led to the reception room by Kim Hannah.", "\u201cI was really shocked when I received the news this morning.\u201d", "Hao Win got to the point as soon as he sat down on the comfy leather couch.", "\u201cSince you were behind it, I\u2019m assuming you know what news I\u2019m talking about. But you know\u2026 how do I say this\u2026 you were a bit too wild\u2026? Or\u2026\u201d", "Hao Win swallowed his words. Seol Jihu smiled without saying anything.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you had your reason. There\u2019s no point in brooding over what\u2019s already happened anyway.\u201d", "Hao Win paused, then leaned back on the couch.", "\u201cBut I am a little disappointed.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m the one who coaxed you into moving to Eva. I didn\u2019t choose Eva just to leave Haramark. I had my own plans.\u201d", "Seol Jihu realized his mistake.", "\u201cMister Hao Win.\u201d", "He tried to say something, but Hao Win raised his hand.", "\u201cOf course, you\u2019re not obligated to follow my plan, Seol.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cBut, Seol, do you remember what we talked about in Haramark\u2019s palace?\u201d", "Seol Jihu quietly nodded his head.\u201cI took an oath to make you a King, and you accepted it. In the Neutral Zone, we were friends. But since you accepted my offer, I think I have the qualification to call myself your partner. Or rather, I thought I did.\u201d", "Hao Win smacked his lips.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just us who think this. Eva\u2019s organizations probably have the same idea. Since we moved here at the same time, they\u2019ll see us as a single entity. In other words, your actions both directly and indirectly affect the Triads.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cNow, I said all this, but the main point is that it would have been nice if you called me on the communication crystal before and just let me know. That way, I would have been able to prepare for the coming day and perhaps even assist you. As your friend and your partner.\u201d", "Although Hao Win seemed to be calm and tactful, Seol Jihu got the feeling that he had a lot of emotions pent-up inside. Hao Win wasn\u2019t being blunt given their relationship, but Seol Jihu could tell that he was disappointed.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. I at least should have contacted you. I was just too worked up at the time\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu trailed off, giving a bitter smile. He didn\u2019t think he would be admitting he acted out of impulse.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t really come here to hear you apologize.\u201d", "Hao Win locked his fingers together.", "\u201cI just want you to trust the Triads a little more. It\u2019s true that we were pushed out of Haramark, but I\u2019ll be troubled if you look down on us too much.\u201d", "Knock, knock.", "\u201cExcuse me.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui entered the room with tea, lightening the heavy atmosphere slightly. Seol Jihu and Hao Win took a quick break to lighten up, exchanging small talk that wasn\u2019t related to the matter at hand. Then, Seol Jihu suddenly grew curious.", "\u201cBy the way, you said you had plans, right?\u201d", "\u201cMn, though I was forced to throw them out of the window this morning.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m curious. Can you tell me about them?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much.\u201d", "Hao Win spoke as if it really was a trivial matter.", "\u201cI planned to make a masterpiece movie with you, pulling a hilarious prank over Eva\u2019s eight organizations. We\u2019d go out and dance PPAP[1] for the ending. Damn, and it was such a good scenario too\u2026\u201d", "Seeing Hao Win talk so regrettably\u2026", "\u201cThat sounds good too. How long were you thinking to wait to start filming this movie?\u201d", "\u201cHalf a year at the earliest, a year at the lastest.\u201d", "\u201cSo 6 to 12 months\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu mulled over the matter before shaking his head.", "\u201cThat\u2019s too long.\u201d", "\u201cIs it? I thought it was just perfect.\u201d", "\u201cI doubt the Parasites will sit back and wait during that time.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I can\u2019t really argue with that.\u201d", "Hao Win agreed easily, then spoke.", "\u201cNow that we\u2019re on this topic, I want to ask. What\u2019s your next plan?\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything concrete. But for sure\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu put more strength into his voice.", "\u201cI\u2019m going all the way.\u201d", "\u201cAll the way\u2026 You mean there\u2019s no room for negotiation or compromise?\u201d", "\u201cNo. I made up my mind after looking around Eva.\u201d", "Tak. Seol Jihu put down his teacup and smiled.", "\u201cI\u2019m going to sweep away every bug that\u2019s gnawing at Paradise. I won\u2019t spare a single one.\u201d", "Hao Win didn\u2019t answer. He neither agreed nor disagreed.", "He only stared at the smiling Seol Jihu with his abyss-like eyes.", "1. Pen Pineapple Apple Pen (for those who are unaware). "]}
