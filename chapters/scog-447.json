{"cid": "447", "title": "Chapter 447. While He is Gone (4)", "content": ["Seol Jihu was still in the hospital.", "His routine couldn\u2019t be more boring. Every day he was examined, given pills and injections, and he slept. When he wasn\u2019t sleeping, he spent all his time staring into the air.", "His doctor told him he shouldn\u2019t rely on pills and suggested reducing doses over time, but Seol Jihu had no intention of following his advice.", "It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t try. He did, but nothing changed. A splitting headache shook his brain whenever the effects of the drugs wore off. Moreover, his sense of emptiness and lack of motivation deepened, driving him further into a severe depression.", "Seeing how much pain Seol Jihu was in, his doctor once again prescribed antidepressants to him, admitting that even though it was only a temporary solution, it was what he needed at the moment.", "Yes, this was much better than before. His senses grew dull and he couldn\u2019t move his body as well as before, but at least, he didn\u2019t feel any pain\u2014because he felt almost nothing.", "If he were to develop tolerance to the current dosage, it would have to be increased. Not even his doctor was sure how long the drugs would work. Regardless, he felt grateful for the numbness caused by the pills.", "Of course, that was only in his opinion. Others could tell he was getting thinner and paler by the day.", "Today too, Seol Jihu was lying in his bed with a blank expression across his face, his eyes staring into space.", "Yoo Seonhwa peeped inside the hospital room with a worried look before clearing her throat.", "\u201cJihu~\u201d", "Trying to sound happy and bright, she entered the room, holding a tray.", "\u201cI\u2019m back. It\u2019s already lunch-time, so I grabbed some food from the cafeteria. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa chattered, as she removed the restraints that had been placed on Seol Jihu. The hospital allowed patients\u2019 restraints to be removed while their drugs were in effect, at their guardians\u2019 discretion.", "\u201cWow. There\u2019s a reason they say that SY is the best of the best. Look at this. It\u2019s huge, right?\u201d", "With a look of pleasant surprise, Yoo Seonhwa picked up a large piece of grilled shrimp with her chopsticks.", "Seol Jihu was silent. He\u2019d been staring into space ever since Yoo Seonhwa entered the room.", "\u201cLet\u2019s dig in before it gets cold. Here, I\u2019ll peel it for you.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa peeled a shrimp and brought it close to his mouth.", "Seol Jihu finally responded. He shook his head slightly from side to side to indicate he didn\u2019t want to eat.", "\u201cJust try one bite. You love grilled shrimp.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cJihu? Come on, say \u2018ah~\u2019\u201d", "Seol Jihu turned his face away from her.", "\u201cJihu\u2026.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s smile faded. She bit her lower lip and let out a long sigh.", "\u201cYou have to eat to get better\u2026.\u201d", "She murmured with downcast eyes and began stroking Seol Jihu\u2019s back with her palm.", "\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, Yoo Seonhwa leaned toward Seol Jihu.", "\u201cDo you want to go out for a walk? Maybe that will make you feel better. What do you say?\u201d", "Again, there was no reply from Seol Jihu. Nonetheless, Yoo Seonhwa pulled him up from the bed and pressed the nurse call button.", "Seol Jihu was dragged upstairs to the hospital\u2019s rooftop. A belt, which was connected to a rope in Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s hand, was tied around his waist, and two male nurses accompanied him as well.", "The sky was clear and the wind was cool.", "There were several people on the rooftop. Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes immediately met those of a person staring at him from afar, but he paid no mind to it.", "\u201cThis sure calls for a misunderstanding, huh?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa lifted her end of the rope and smiled bitterly.", "\u201cThe weather\u2019s nice~ I hope you get better soon so that we can go out and play.\u201d", "She made Seol Jihu sit on a bench before flopping down beside him. Then she began to chatter without a pause. This confused Seol Jihu. She wasn\u2019t like this when she threw the 2 million won in his face\u2026.", "Or was she?", "Seol Jihu\u2019s forehead tensed in a small frown. It was then.", "Buzz!", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s voice stopped at the same time as a vibration rang in her pocket.", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "She saw the name on the screen and glanced at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWait here. I\u2019ll get you something to drink.\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t tell if it was an important call or if it was something else, but he was better off not knowing. Anyhow, Yoo Seonhwa handed the rope to the nurse and got up.", "\u201cYes, yes\u2026. Right now\u2026.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s voice receded farther and farther into the distance.", "In the meantime, Seol Jihu sat perfectly still, his eyes staring up at the sky when suddenly someone approached him from the railing and sat down next to him.", "\u201cHey.\u201d", "A voice called him.", "Seol Jihu slowly dropped his gaze.", "There, he saw a woman whom he had probably never met before in his life, looking at him with a bright smile across her face. He could tell from the way she was dressed that she was a patient just like himself.", "\u201cYes, you.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cHaven't we met somewhere before? Ah, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not trying to hit on you. I\u2019m really just curious.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re quiet, aren\u2019t you? You remind me of myself when I first came to this hospital.\u201d", "The woman smiled when Seol Jihu remained silent.", "Seol Jihu slowly shook his head.", "\u201cNo? That\u2019s odd. You look familiar\u2026.\u201d", "The woman tilted her head slightly, but before long, she shrugged as if the issue had already disappeared from her mind. Then she raised her arms above her head and stretched.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t the weather nice today?\u201d", "With an expression as bright as the autumn sky, the woman closed her eyes to enjoy the cool breeze on her face.", "Seol Jihu was about to turn his eyes back to the sky, but instead, he stopped to examine the woman who was brushing away her hair from her face. Perhaps it was because of what she said that suddenly made him feel like he had, in fact, seen her somewhere before.", "\u201cWhen I\u2019m feeling down and low, I find that the best solution is to go on a trip. The weather\u2019s so nice, too\u2026.\u201d", "The woman opened her eyes slowly and glanced at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cShould we go?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cOn a trip, I mean. Should we just leave?\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t figure out why she was asking him of all people. He turned his gaze away from the woman, not even bothering to answer her question.", "\u201cTo somewhere, no one knows.\u201d", "But that was before she said this. Seol Jihu turned his gaze back to the woman, and she smiled.", "\u201cOver there.\u201d", "Suddenly her voice dwindled to a whisper. She quietly gestured behind her. Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes now reflected the sky and the cityscape beyond the railing.", "\u201cDo you want to go with me?\u201d", "A trip\u2026. A trip to somewhere no one knows.", "Seol Jihu stared at the sky with empty eyes. He didn\u2019t know why, but he felt intrigued by the woman\u2019s suggestion. A trip sounded nice to him.", "\u201cBut you have to make some preparations beforehand.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened slightly.", "\u201cBecause you won\u2019t be able to leave in that state.\u201d", "The woman pointed at the belt tied around Seol Jihu\u2019s waist.", "\u201cSo smile.\u201d", "Smile?", "\u201cLike this. Look at me.\u201d", "She pulled up the corners of her mouth with the tip of her fingers. Her red lips curved upward to form a smile.", "\u201cSmile even if you feel sad, and then you can go on a trip.\u201d", "He then noticed that there was no rope attached to the woman and no nurse watching her nearby.", "\u201cHow about it? When you\u2019re ready, we should\u2014\u201d", "It was then.", "\u201cJihu!\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa hurriedly jumped in between them, looking slightly angry.", "\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "The woman met Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s fierce glare with a look of innocent surprise, tipping her head slightly to the side.", "Fuming from her nose, Yoo Seonhwa turned her head to the nurse.", "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop them?\u201d", "\u201cPardon? But they were just talking\u2026 and it wasn\u2019t anything weird. They were talking about going on a trip.\u201d", "\u201cA trip?\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily stop patients from interacting with each other unless otherwise noted.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa let out a deep sigh.", "\u201cJihu. What did she say to you?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa looked down at Seol Jihu and clicked her tongue.", "\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s go back to your room.\u201d", "She grabbed Seol Jihu\u2019s arms and helped him up.", "\u2018A trip\u2026.\u2019", "While heading for the stairs, Seol Jihu glanced behind his shoulder. It turned out that the woman was also looking at him, and their eyes met.", "The woman waved and smiled brightly as if assuring him that they would meet again.", "*", "Draft calls were issued in all of the cities.", "The situation was grim.", "The Parasites, with their superior mobility, invaded both Grazia and Caligo at the same time. Sung Shihyun and Vulgar Chastity were in charge of the former while Exploding Patience and Twisted Kindness were in charge of the latter.", "Fortunately, unlike Nur\u2019s case, the two cities were able to evacuate their residents before the enemy arrived. But the fact remained unchanged that humanity lost two cities without even getting a chance to fight back.", "They had no choice. The Parasites attacked with a ferocity that the two cities couldn\u2019t possibly stand.", "The Parasite Queen\u2019s intention was clear. She was taking advantage of Seol Jihu\u2019s absence to destroy any and everything that he might come back to.", "The Federation dispatched auxiliary forces and humanity was gathering soldiers as well. However\u2026.", "\u2018We have to save at least one city\u2026.\u2019", "The situation was not in their favor. Nur and Scheherazade were already in ruins, and now two more cities were under enemy control.", "Only three cities remained.", "Both Odor and Haramark lost their use as fortresses when the enemy penetrated their rear defense. The only comforting thing about the current situation was that Eva, which was closest of all cities to Tigol Fortress, and whose fortification was almost complete, still remained intact. However, there was no guarantee that it would stay that way even after the Parasites decided to attack it with full force.", "\u201cHaaaa\u2026.\u201d", "Teresa looked down at the map spread across her desk and fell into contemplation. She was so focused on her thoughts that she failed to notice the footsteps approaching her.", "\u201cTake a look at this.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t until she saw a necklace dangling in front of her that she came to her senses.", "The necklace was beautifully handcrafted.", "Teresa raised her head. Prihi pulled his arm back, then tossed the necklace into the air and caught it again, as if to flaunt its splendor.", "\u201c\u2026Father?\u201d", "\u201cYes, it is me.\u201d", "\u201cThat necklace\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s my wife\u2019s and your mother\u2019s keepsake.\u201d", "Prihi answered calmly.", "\u201cAnd it\u2019s also a Royal Oath.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "After a brief pause, Teresa jumped back in surprise.", "Prihi snorted.", "\u201cWhy are you so surprised? You know that both you and I each have one.\u201d", "\u201cBut you said you already used it!\u201d", "\u201cI said that I would accept Valhalla\u2019s terms, but never said that I used the Royal Oath to gain the right to manage Earthlings\u2019 settings.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cBut my kind and generous future son-in-law sent the members of the Federation to Haramark without even double-checking. I trusted him not to kill his future father-in-law over this.\u201d", "Prihi winked.", "Teresa\u2019s face brightened.", "\u201cSo\u2026 you had it with you this whole time?\u201d", "\u201cMm. Well, since there\u2019s only one left, I was going to use it at an appropriate moment. I knew the Parasites wouldn\u2019t leave us alone.\u201d", "Prihi shrugged his shoulders and continued.", "\u201cThe truth is that I tried to use it many times already.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cHow could I sit still knowing my future son-in-law is in danger? I heard one Divine Wish isn\u2019t enough, but I figured I\u2019d convince them somehow.\u201d", "\u201cYou did!?\u201d", "Teresa leaned forward in excitement.", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Prihi tilted his head back calmly.", "\u201cI asked them if they could reduce the number of contribution points needed for the Divine Wish or modify the resurrection setting.\u201d", "\u201cAnd?\u201d", "\u201cThey said both can\u2019t be done.\u201d", "\u201cBut why!?\u201d", "Teresa sounded desperate.", "\u201cMore precisely, they said it would be a waste of a good Royal Oath.\u201d", "Prihi gave a bitter smile.", "\u201cAt its core, a Royal Oath is a Divine Wish. The only difference is that the gods can\u2019t refuse it.\u201d", "Which meant that Royal Oaths too had limits.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to use it if it can\u2019t achieve more than a Divine Wish can.\u201d", "Basically, a Royal Oath\u2019s maximum output was the same as that of a Divine Wish, and nothing worthwhile could be achieved with just one in regards to the problem at hand.", "\u201cWhen I heard that, I couldn\u2019t press them further. Now that I think about it, if it were really possible to wish for something of that caliber, I probably would have wished for 100 new Royal Oaths.\u201d", "Prihi muttered, looking slightly downhearted.", "\u201c\u2026What about the resurrection setting?\u201d", "\u201cSame. It can\u2019t be changed with a single Royal Oath. They said if they could, they would\u2019ve already modified it.\u201d", "Prihi smacked his lips.", "\u201cThe cause of my future son-in-law\u2019s death is the Parasite Queen\u2026. The gods said in order to change the result, I need something that could match the grandiosity of the cause, and one Royal Oath falls short by a lot.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThey kept mentioning the law of causality, the law of the world, blah, blah, blah\u2026. I couldn\u2019t understand any of it. Anyway, I began thinking about what to do next\u2026.\u201d", "Prihi fidgeted with the necklace before suddenly swinging his arm.", "With widened eyes, Teresa instinctively reached out her hand.", "\u201cI, Prihi Hussey, hereby transfer the ownership of the Royal Oath, to Teresa Hussey.\u201d", "The announcement was all too sudden.", "\u201cF-Father?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 Do think of it as your dowry. It\u2019s the least I can do as the father of a daughter who\u2019s going to marry the greatest hero of our time.\u201d", "Teresa\u2019s jaw dropped slowly.", "\u201cI noticed that you\u2019ve been falling behind your rivals ever since you two parted. Use this as an opportunity to win his affection.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "Teresa became speechless.", "Prihi smirked.", "\u201cAnyway, that necklace is now yours. Use it at your own will but with discretion.\u201d", "\u201cFather\u2026!\u201d", "Teresa\u2019s voice rose in pitch.", "Seeing his daughter\u2019s eyes sparkle with delight, Prihi spread his arms wide open with a gentle smile.", "\u201cYes, my daughter\u2026.\u201d", "And Teresa\u2026.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go tell everyone right now!\u201d", "\u2026rushed out of the room, past her father, with the necklace in her hand.", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "A gust of cold wind blew past Prihi.", "\u201cSo much for raising a daughter\u2026.\u201d", "His arms dropped to his sides.", "\u2018I miss you, sweetheart.\u2019", "His heart began to fill with a longing for his wife, who he lost during the war.", "\u2018Gee.\u2019", "But shortly after, Prihi broke into a smile.", "It wasn\u2019t as if he gained nothing.

If only acquiring a Divine Wish was easy\u2026.", "When Prihi heard from the gods that no Earthling in Paradise currently had enough contribution points to exchange for a Divine Wish, he immediately abandoned that method. It was not only dangerous but also virtually impossible to obtain the necessary contribution points during the coming war.", "So there was only one hope left\u2014he somehow had to obtain a second Royal Oath.", "\u2018Eva\u2019s already used theirs\u2026 and Nur\u2019s can\u2019t be transferred\u2026. What should I do\u2026.\u2019", "The Queen of Grazia had already used hers a long time ago to revive her dead son. It\u2019s a shame because even though she used a national treasure for her personal gain, her son died again in less than two years fighting in the war.", "Odor and Caligo\u2019s royal families used theirs to obtain the right to manage the Earthlings\u2019 settings when they first allied with the Federation.", "In the end, there was only one royal family left.", "\u2018Given the circumstances, she may have already used it.
