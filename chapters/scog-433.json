However, it was at the cost of losing Baek Haeju and other trusted comrades, leaving her to be the sole survivor.", "She only found out the identity of the man afterward.", "That the name of her savior was none other than the infamous \u2018Seol Jihu\u2019.", "That \u2018Seol\u2019 was not the name of the young man who had carried her bag several years ago, but rather his last name.", "And that the unremarkable young man who had once been used as a mere meat shield was the same person as the Spear Demon who defeated a Parasite Army Commander\u2026.", "Seol Jihu escorted Seo Yuhui to the intensive care unit at the Temple of Luxuria. When Seo Yuhui looked for him after recovering from her injuries and mental shock, Seol Jihu was nowhere to be found. He had left without saying anything as soon as he had fulfilled his promise.", "When she tried looking for Seol Jihu just in case\u2026", "\u201cWhat? Why are you looking for him? That guy is a madman, a total lunatic! He doesn\u2019t know what enough is.\u201d", "\u201cThat said, his skill with the spear is amazing. I once saw him rampaging on the battlefield. I\u2019ve never seen a man more aptly described as a demon.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s a cold-blooded man. Don\u2019t think of him as a mere Earthling.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s very violent and cruel. The Spear Demon treats everyone around him as an enemy. There must be a reason why he wasn\u2019t chosen by the Seven Sins despite his ability.\u201d", "Everyone around Seo Yuhui tried to stop her. They questioned why she was trying to meet someone who had turned his back on humanity and used his allies for his goals.", "Despite all this, Seo Yuhui did not give in and left in search of him. She didn\u2019t understand why, either.", "Why was it that whenever she thought of that man, the lust that had always plagued her vanished like a lie? And why did her heart well up with indescribable emotions?", "She would find the answer if she met him.", "Seol Jihu was in the Federation. Even though the night was deep, he was training in a forest, thick with trees and shrubbery. He was swinging his spear madly as if he couldn\u2019t bear to live without doing so.", "Seo Yuhui stood at the top of the hill, silently watching Seol Jihu sweating profusely, as he thrust and cut with his spear. She immediately wanted to go down and talk to him, but for some reason, she strongly felt that she shouldn\u2019t approach him.", "The night passed, and morning arrived. Seol Jihu\u2019s spear finally stopped when the rays of dawn spilled over the horizon.", "Seol Jihu, who had continuously moved without a second of rest until that moment, suddenly dropped his spear.", "He stood still like a stone statue for a long while before placing his hands on a large tree and dropping his head.", "And from his lowered face, silver droplets started falling.", "He was crying.", "The terrifying man called the Spear Demon was crying. He was shedding tears while repeatedly calling out Baek Haeju and Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s name.", "At that instant, Seo Yuhui realized the source of the uncertain emotions that surrounded her.", "All of Luxuria\u2019s attributes that she shared after being appointed as the Star of Lust were causing a huge ripple inside her.", "It urged her to go down quickly and comfort him.", "Yes, she was going to act according to her feelings.", "Seo Yuhui had already gotten up and was going down the hill by the time she realized this. She approached Seol Jihu, who was silently weeping and slowly stretched out her hand.", "Seol Jihu must have felt her presence as he turned around while wiping his eyes.", "It was strange. She had always rejected making contact with others, almost as if she had mysophobia. However, she felt no hesitation even as her hands wiped the tears from Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes. Instead, she felt a strong sense of longing and pity.", "\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui quietly spoke as she wiped the tears off the silently blinking Seol Jihu.", "\u201cMiss Baek Haeju isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not too late. We can save her. You and me, let\u2019s save her together.\u201d", "A glistening pair of eyes gazed back at her.", "A moment later, Seol Jihu took a few steps back. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and sniffled before nodding.", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "And he spoke.", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui softly smiled when she saw Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes regain their light.", "", "*", "", "It was the start of an odd partnership.", "As they began traveling together, Seo Yuhui gradually learned more about the person named Seol Jihu.", "She learned that he was a year older than she was, that he had a brusque personality but was surprisingly tactful, that the ramen he cooked once in a while was absolutely sensational, and so on.", "But what surprised her the most was just how much time he spent training.", "It could be said without even the slightest exaggeration that the entirety of Seol Jihu\u2019s daily life was composed of training. He trained while he walked, ate, and even while he slept.", "Once, she had suddenly heard a resounding boom in the middle of the night, and when she had hurriedly gone out to look, an enormous boulder was in the place where Seol Jihu had been sleeping. She was shocked senseless when she saw Seol Jihu tying the boulder back up on a tree before going back to sleep under it.", "\u201cWhy\u2026 why are you doing that?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Huh? Ah, I\u2019m trying to raise the rank of my Intuition skill.\u201d", "\u201cStill, isn\u2019t that a bit\u2026\u201d", "\u201cMy talent isn\u2019t that good. I need to work hard so that a certain someone doesn\u2019t worry about me.\u201d", "Seol Jihu gave a bitter smile.", "\u201cWell, not that I have anyone who will worry about me anymore\u2026\u201d", "Seo Yuhui looked at the troubled Seol Jihu with a conflicted gaze.", "In the past, when she told him to go back during their first meeting, she meant it to keep Baek Haeju from worrying. However, Seol Jihu had taken her words differently.", "He had trained with the determination to die so that she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about him. From then until now.", "It went to show just how sincere Seol Jihu was about Baek Haeju.", "Just from this alone, she could tell that Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t a bad person.", "However, how Seo Yuhui saw him and how the public saw him went in two completely different directions.", "It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t understand the reason for his rising infamy.", "Seol Jihu was often excessive to the extreme. He didn\u2019t care what means he used to accomplish his goals.", "People badmouthed him. They called him a self-centered bastard who didn\u2019t know how to cooperate with others, a greedy scoundrel blinded by contribution points, and a madman crazed with war.", "However, Seo Yuhui could not speak ill of Seol Jihu. Because she knew why Seol Jihu was like that.", "Above all, Seo Yuhui trusted her eyes. Even in reality, when it came to matters that weren\u2019t related to Baek Haeju, Seol Jihu was a very normal and an honorable man.", "People around her always told her to be careful, but she did not need to worry. It was because Seol Jihu kept a distance by himself.", "She didn\u2019t know whether it was because he was considerate of her identity as the Star of Lust. But he paid careful attention to keep himself from coming into contact with her, unlike a certain someone who would always joke about groping her breasts.", "He also did not speak more than necessary. His blank eyes that occasionally stared into space showed her that his mind was full, always thinking about Baek Haeju.", "In the first place, Seol Jihu did not think of Seo Yuhui as anything more than a helper. And every time she felt this way, Seo Yuhui became a little envious of Baek Haeju.", "One day, Seo Yuhui, bored of his silence, threw a question at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s pipster?\u201d", "Seol Jihu, who was just about to meditate after sitting cross-legged, flinched.", "\u201cHow did you hear about that nickname\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cI remember Haeju saying it once.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was delighted.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure what it means either, but it\u2019s a pet name that Haeju made for me. She\u2019s called me pipster all the time\u2026\u201d", "A smile bloomed on his face.", "So he can make a face like that. He knows how to smile\u2026 Seo Yuhui murmured to herself while nodding.", "\u201cYou must truly love Miss Baek Haeju.\u201d", "She said while gently leaning her head on her gathered knees.", "\u201cRather than love\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled as he drew his head back and looked at the sky.", "\u201cThere is something I have to say to her\u2026 something that I have to apologize to her about.\u201d", "Seeing the lonely eyes reflecting the starlight in the night sky, Seo Yuhui subconsciously replied.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened between you two\u2026 but won\u2019t Miss Baek Haeju change her mind if she found out how hard you\u2019re trying?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face sank in an instant. Seo Yuhui carefully added, in case she made a mistake.", "\u201cI sure would have\u2026 if I were her.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was silent for a long time. After a while, he replied with a short, \u2018I see,\u2019 before closing his eyes.", "Seo Yuhui smiled bitterly while looking at Seol Jihu, who started meditating. She then thought to herself, I\u2019ve never seen someone who is more of an iron wall than me.", "*", "Seol Jihu was most definitely a strong person. However, he was also fragile at times as if he might shatter at any moment.", "Seo Yuhui could not leave Seol Jihu alone and devoted herself to caring for him while she was with him.", "On the other hand, she trusted and depended on him. He was a trustworthy companion and a Warrior who was stronger than anyone else. Staying next to him helped calm her body and mind.", "That was right. The two shared a relationship of mutual trust.", "It was fun. The situation in Paradise was becoming worse by the day, but Seo Yuhui ironically felt at peace.", "She felt an inexplicable sense of fulfillment during the times when they had each other\u2019s backs and when she would lean on his back while walking forwards together, step by step.", "It was one of her few moments of happiness in Paradise.", "However, that moment did not last long.", "Their separation came abruptly.", "*", "\u201cThere\u2019s a place I need to go to.\u201d", "One day, Seol Jihu suddenly bid her farewell after meeting a Magician known as the last hope of humanity.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d", "\u201cNo. It\u2019s a place I must go alone.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cHaeju asked me to keep you safe. I can\u2019t protect you there, which means I will be breaking my promise with her.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d", "\u201cBut I do.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stood quietly for a moment before speaking in a calm voice.", "\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d", "\u201cYou said it once before. That I need to think about how not to make others worry before worrying about them.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui unwittingly shut her mouth. Seol Jihu fumbled for something in his pocket.", "\u201cIn any case, it\u2019s not much compared to the help you\u2019ve given me all this time, but\u2026\u201d", "What he took out from his pocket was a brightly shining little orb.", "\u201cThis is the divinity that I got after killing Abhorrent Charity.\u201d", "\u201cWhy are you\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIf I can somehow save her in the future, can I ask you to take care of Haeju on Earth?\u201d", "Seol Jihu continued without waiting for a reply.", "\u201cAnd even if it\u2019s not because of my request\u2026 I\u2019d like you to return to Earth before it\u2019s too late.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s heart sank.", "She knew for a fact that humanity\u2019s current situation was irreparably disadvantageous. In other words, he was telling her to escape.", "Seol Jihu handed over the divinity to her. Seo Yuhui tried to refuse, but he forcibly placed it in her grasp. Then, he retreated a few steps.", "\u201cI plan on fulfilling the agreement I made with Eun Yuri. Once I go, I might not be able to return\u2026 No, that will most likely be the case.\"", "He refused to take Seo Yuhui because it was too dangerous.", "\u201cI\u2019ll leave Haeju in your care. I\u2019m sorry for repeating this, but you\u2019re the only person I can trust.\u201d", "He wanted her to live before she got caught up in greater danger.", "\u201cAlso\u2026 thank you for everything until now.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bowed. Then, he immediately disappeared after turning his body around.", "\u201cW-Wait!\u201d", "Seo Yuhui reacted a moment later, but Seol Jihu was nowhere to be found.", "He had really left.", "Her aimlessly outstretched hand grasped at the place where Seol Jihu had just been standing.", "But all she could grasp was air.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Cold air blew past her cheeks.", "Seo Yuhui stood in a daze for a long while before her expression began to break down.", "\u201cAh\u2026\u201d", "Her eyes grew blurry.", "\u201cAh\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201d", "She had not gotten a chance to say anything.", "A stream of tears filled with sorrow fell down her cheeks and wet her trembling, tightly shut lips.", "*", "Seol Jihu had left.", "Seo Yuhui had no way of knowing what happened afterward. However, she knew that it was a failure, not a success.", "The Parasites invaded Tigol Fortress without reserve and, in the end, succeeded in capturing it. Unable to protect the World Tree, which was their final bastion, the Federation quickly collapsed.", "As soon as the Federation fell, the Parasites turned their weapons towards humanity.", "And humanity, which had been wrapped up in internal conflict until then, collapsed all too easily.", "With Eva as the start, other cities began falling, one by one.", "Eventually, humanity came to their senses and tried to fight back with the capital as their base, but Scheherazade was also easily captured.", "There was no other outcome as the bishop of the Temple of Luxuria, Roberto Servillo, defected and led the traitors to help the Parasites from the inside. In the end, the only city left standing was Nur.", "With Eun Yuri and Odelette Delphine as the center, humanity joined forces with the remnants of the Federation to prepare for their last stand.", "There was no news of Seol Jihu, but she did not want to think that he died. There were talks in the streets that he had appeared in Scheherazade.", "She knew he would appear on the battlefield as long as he was alive.", "And so, Seo Yuhui headed for Nur.", "Then, at last, the final war broke out.", "*", "A bleak wind blew in the area.", "An unpleasant stench of ash, corpses, and all sorts of disgusting odor blanketed the wasteland.", "One woman was desperately searching around the battlefield after the war was over.", "Seo Yuhui wasn\u2019t unharmed, but she did not stop her steps.
