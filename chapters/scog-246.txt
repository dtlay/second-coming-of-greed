Although he didn\u2019t have any business here, he wandered in as though he was entranced.", "Perhaps because it was the middle of the night, the temple was empty.", "As soon as the stone statue came into view, Seol Jihu stopped and bowed.", "He emptied his mind as well. He simply wanted to.", "Gula didn\u2019t initiate a conversation either. She simply reached out toward Seol Jihu\u2019s head, stroking it quietly.", "In the beautiful night, a warrior stood in front of a stone statue with his head bowed, and a goddess placed her hand on his head.", "How much time went by?

She immediately thought, \u2018No way\u2019. She quickly chased after him, and as expected, Seol Jihu was in his room, putting on his armor. They were cheap goods easily found in stores.", "Becoming sure of her suspicion, Kim Hannah darted forward in fright.", "\u201cH-Hey! Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t answer and silently tightened a leather strap.", "\u201cHeey!\u201d", "When Kim Hannah jumped up and down, throwing a fit\u2026", "\u201cThere\u2019s a tale from the Romance of Three Kingdoms.\u201d", "He finally spat out a line.", "\u201cWhen Cao Cao was in the Army of the Western Garden as the Colonel Who Arranged the Army, Jian Shuo\u2019s uncle, an influential eunuch of the Ten Attendants, broke the law.

To show me.\u201d", "It finally hit Kim Hannah that something was off.", "The Seol Jihu in front of her wasn\u2019t the Seol Jihu she knew. His usual carefree attitude was nowhere to be seen. Instead, he had transformed into a demon radiating a chilling aura.", "Almost as if he was possessed.", "It was a mistake if she could call it that. Kim Hannah wanted to enrage Seol Jihu and for him to direct that fury at the eight organizations ruling Eva.", "The problem was that she overshot the mark.", "Never in her wildest imaginations did she think he would draw his sword on his first day here.", "In fact, this was the first time that she was seeing Seol Jihu with his \u2018switch\u2019 on.

The spear was still heavy, and he could still feel resistance from it.", "Seol Jihu sighed and put down his spear. Then, just as he was about to gather his comrades\u2026 he caught sight of a red egg sitting in the middle of the doorway.", "What was it doing there? The moment he thought this\u2026", "Woong! Along with a vigorous ringing sound, formless energy burst out from the egg.", "Although his eyes could not see it, the flow of the energy spread out like a ripple. It passed Seol Jihu and touched the Spear of Purity.", "Woooooong! As the energy pulsated, a mystical phenomenon occurred. The translucent spear began to fill up with color.", "It only took a few seconds for the silvery-white light, spreading like water paint, to completely dye the spear.", "What looked like an object carved out of ice now looked like it was crafted with white snow.", "Seol Jihu unknowingly picked up the Spear of Purity, which was emitting a silvery light. His eyebrows immediately went up.", "The heaviness and resistance were completely gone. It was light like he was holding a pool noodle, and he could move it as he wished.", "He couldn\u2019t feel anything beyond this change, but what mattered was that the Spear of Purity was now usable.", "Seol Jihu stared at the red egg.", "Until now, it didn\u2019t even pretend to listen to him, so why was it allowing him to use the spear now?", "The answer was easy. The Arcus Spirit was an examiner, observing its owner\u2019s actions and permitting the spear\u2019s use as fit.", "\u2018I see.\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes flickered. This must mean that the Arcus Spirit approved of his plan.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Are we fighting someone?\u201d", "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d", "His teammates rushed inside even before they were called because loud voices had gone back and forth along with a powerful undulation of energy.", "\u201cI have something to say.\u201d", "Seol Jihu calmly spoke.", "Feeling the heavy air, everyone became quiet. Yi Seol-Ah stared at Seol Jihu with an anxious look.", "\u201cCan you\u2026 trust me this one time and follow me?\u201d", "It was out of the blue. Chohong and Hugo justifiably wore expressions that said, \u2018What crap are you spouting?\u2019", "But that only lasted a moment. After seeing the armor on Seol Jihu and the spear in his hand, they exchanged glances with each other.", "And then they turned around and left at the same time.", "By the time they came back, they were fully armed with their own equipment.", "\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d", "Chohong placed the Thorn of Steel on her shoulder and nodded.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "She agreed readily.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but you must have your reason.

A world poisoned by self-indulgence.]", "That Paradise wouldn\u2019t change just because of this.", "What the eight organizations would do, how the royal family would react, and how the Earthlings would view this matter\u2014 these things were all obvious.", "Some might say that he was acting up. That he would need to get badly burnt before he would snap out of his fantasies.", "But\u2026", "[It\u2019s good to be angry at your losses. It\u2019s not bad to scorn yourself and reflect on your actions. That\u2019s all good, but\u2014]", "[But\u2026 is that all?]", "The world wouldn\u2019t change if he stayed still.", "Do unto others as they do unto you. That was what he learned at the Banquet.", "He had told Sorg K\u00fchne.

Can I get my equipment back? Hurry.\u201d", "Kim Hannah didn\u2019t answer.

Passing through the night street, they headed to the outskirts of the city, where the VIP auction house was located.", "A shabby building came into view from a distance.", "Chohong and Hugo walked in silence. Marcel Ghionea loaded his crossbow, and Maria quickly chanted a spell.", "\u201cAre you really going?\u201d", "Phi Sora asked again with a look of disbelief. This was already the eighth time.", "\u201cAre you really going?\u201d", "The ninth.", "\u201cYou know that doing this is waging war against all of Eva\u2019s organizations, right? Are you sure you can han\u2014\u201d", "Phi Sora couldn\u2019t finish her sentence. It was because Seol Jihu glared at her with an irritated look.", "Although he didn\u2019t say anything, his intent had been delivered.", "Leave if you\u2019re going to ask again.", "\u201cHmph, I was just worried about you.\u201d", "Phi Sora grumbled in a burst of anger. And she redirected this anger to the poor building in front of her.", "Before they noticed, they were in front of the building. Because they didn\u2019t sneak around and directly approached the building from the front, the three or four guards at the entrance turned to face them.", "Rather than asking for the tenth time, the grumbling Phi Sora unsheathed the longsword she borrowed again.", "\u201cFine, but just for the record, you\u2019re the one who wanted this.\u201d", "Seol Jihu slowly nodded his head.", "In the next instant, the air around her changed. She stopped and bent her knees.", "On the other hand\u2026", "\u201cWho are these guys?\u201d", "One of the guards who detected her hostility stepped up.", "\u201cOver there, st\u2014\u201d", "Whish! Before he could even finish, a fierce wind blew forth. The guard looked up instinctively, seeing the longsword in the woman\u2019s hand flying up like a butterfly and stinging like a bee.", "Swish. The blade cut through its target like tofu. Blood flowed down from the severed surface.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Having been beheaded in the blink of an eye, the guard\u2019s body dropped down. The guard standing behind him opened his mouth in shock.", "\u201cWha\u2014\u201d", "Boom! His face exploded before he noticed. As filth mixed with brain matter and blood splattered everywhere, the two remaining guards turned their gazes in a daze.", "There, with a young man shaking his arm, a group of people was gradually coming closer.", "They could also see two Mana Spears, hurling toward them at frightening speeds.", "Boom, boom!", "With a split second time difference, their heads popped like balloons. Suddenly having lost their heads, their bodies dropped down one by one.", "Starting from this point, a terrifying storm raged up from Seol Jihu\u2019s body. The killing intent he had been suppressing shot out freely.", "And just like that\u2026", "\u201cWe\u2019re at a landfill.\u201d", "On the first night of their arrival at Eva\u2026", "\u201cEveryone.\u201d", "Carpe Diem, under Seol Jihu\u2019s command\u2026", "\u201cAnnihilate them all.\u201d", "\u2026opened fire against Eva\u2019s eight organizations."]}
