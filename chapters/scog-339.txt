With the rebirth of the Spirits that returned to void, how could they not be happy?", "At one moment, the rejoicing Spirits all turned to one direction. The commotion stopped, replaced by murmurings.", "Flap\u2026 Flap\u2026", "Under the flapping wings of the phoenix descending from the sky, a group of humans was hurriedly running up.", "They were the saviors of the Spirit Realm, who risked their lives to fight the Army Commanders.", "The young Spirits\u2019 eyes lit up.", "Seol Jihu ran.", "He was surprised to see the enormous tree that did not fully enter his line of sight and the group of Spirits that had suddenly multiplied, but he did not stop running.", "Now, there was only a single step remaining.", "Tigol Fortress must be in the middle of a bitter fight, so there was no time to be enjoying their victory with leisure.", "If they dilly-dallied for too long and let the fortress fall by being a few minutes late, it would be his greatest regret.", "So when Seol Jihu saw the five existences presumed to be the Spirit Kings, he shouted at the top of his lungs.", "\u201cTigol Fortress!\u201d", "Jumping into the lake, he shouted again.", "\u201cThe pathway connected to Tigol Fortress\u2014!\u201d", "However, he couldn\u2019t finish his sentence as several Spirits flew into his embrace as soon as he entered the water.", "\u201cW-Wait!\u201d", "[Human!

Aaaang\u2014!]", "Seol Jihu shook his arm in a hurry, and the Spirit that was pushed back blinked in shock before bursting into tears.", "\u201cAh, jeez\u2026!\u201d", "[Stop.]", "At that moment, a low voice resounded in the area.", "The Spirits all froze and fell silent. Even the sorrowfully sobbing red Spirit stopped crying.", "[Please forgive them, human.]", "Seol turned. A red blazing giant was looking down at him from the sky.", "[Fire Spirits are true to their feelings by nature, especially in situations where they\u2019re moved emotionally beyond their control.]", "Seol Jihu had never seen this giant before, but it was easy to tell that this was the Fire Spirit King, Ifrit, from the powerful energy he had.", "\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d", "As he petted the quietly sobbing Spirit\u2019s head, the Spirit smiled softly as if it never cried.", "Seol Jihu sighed before looking up at Ifrit with a burning gaze.", "[\u2026I know.]", "Ifrit nodded his head, seemingly understanding why Seol Jihu was in such a rush.", "[After reaching adulthood, the World Tree helped your group pressure the Army Commander.

He was wondering where so many Spirits came from. High-ranked Spirits that were incomparable to lowest and low-ranked Spirits were looking at him from a distance.", "[That process has ended just now as well.]", "Smiling sweetly, Sylphid continued where Ifrit left off. She no longer sounded feeble as the refreshing feeling of the wind could be felt from her voice.", "[All that is left now is\u2026]", "Ssss, ssss!", "As Sylphid was talking, the branches of the tree suddenly shook.", "When Seol Jihu turned to the center of the lake, his expression slowly changed.", "The sense of urgency inside him disappeared, and surprise took its place.", "Standing there was an enormous, magnificent ash tree that easily overlooked the entire lake. It stood majestically, looking like it was holding up the sky, and its viridescent leaves gave off a heavenly aura.", "There was also an apple-red fruit hanging on the top of the tree, looking ever so succulent. Together with the amber lights fluttering around the tree, almost as if dancing, the picturesque scenery was enough to draw out the awe of anyone watching.", "The beautiful, noble appearance of the World Tree left Seol Jihu speechless as well.", "At that moment, one of the branches gently moved down. It headed straight for Seol Jihu as if to point at him, and the leaves hanging on the twig rustled softly.", "It was almost like it was bashfully beckoning him to come closer.", "A gentle wind then blew as Sylphid waved her hand with a chortle.", "\u201cUuuuh\u2026\u201d", "As a result, both Seol Jihu and the expedition team members behind him were pushed across the lake.", "Once they landed in front of the World Tree, the tree\u2019s branches came down and tightly embraced Seol Jihu.", "Rustling up to him, the leaves tickled his cheeks. It was like a newborn baby recognizing its mother and running to her embrace.", "[You\u2019re mistaken, World Tree-nim. He is indeed the one who helped you be born, but he\u2019s human. He isn\u2019t your father.]", "Sylphid said something Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t understand, so he just stayed still.", "To be honest, it felt pretty good. When he took a deep breath of the refreshing air of the leaves, he felt his vertigo disappear like it was being purified.", "Ssss\u2026.", "\u2018\u2026Huh?\u2019", "No, it wasn\u2019t just a feeling.", "When the gently glowing light fell on Seol Jihu and the other members of the expedition team, their bodies really underwent a change.", "Both small and big wounds vanished, new skin sprouted up, and vitality coursed through their fatigued bodies. Pure, clean energy surged up from the bottom of their bodies and filled up like river water.", "Seol Jihu moaned quietly as clean mana boiled up and soothed his screaming mana circuit. It wasn\u2019t until something plopped down on his head that he snapped out of his stupor.", "Seol Jihu did a double-take before taking the thing rolling down from his head with both hands.", "What hit his head was none other than the apple-red fruit that was hanging on top of the WorldTree.", "[Oh my.]", "Sylphid, who was watching with delight, exclaimed quietly.", "[That is the first fruit of the World Tree, which can only be made after it reaches adulthood\u2026 It must have really taken a liking to you.]", "Seol Jihu fiddled with the fruit that felt cool.", "\u2018It sounds like it\u2019s amazing\u2026\u2019", "He acknowledged the World Tree\u2019s expression of gratitude and was also thankful that it gave him such a precious gift.", "But that wasn\u2019t what was important right now.", "[Worry not, human.]", "Noticing how anxious Seol Jihu was, Ifrit answered his worries calmly.", "[Do you see the lights floating around World Tree-nim?]", "\u201cY-Yes.\u201d", "[World Tree-nim is already in the process of doing what you desire. It started as soon as it finished giving birth to new life.]", "\u2018That means\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu nodded his head unwittingly.", "He wasn\u2019t exactly sure what was going on, but it sounded like the World Tree was doing its best.", "\u2018I\u2019m glad to hear that, but\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu asked.", "\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d", "[I\u2019m not sure. Connecting to the Middle World and creating a new avatar in Tigol Fortress isn\u2019t all that easy.]", "Though he said this, Ifrit gave a gentle smile.", "[But World Tree-nim is an existence rivaling a god.]", "[And because it just reached adulthood, its power is at its prime. It won\u2019t take long. A few more minutes should be enough.]", "A few more minutes\u2026", "Though it wouldn\u2019t satisfy him even if he could go right this moment, Seol Jihu swallowed his words as it sounded like that was the best-case scenario.", "[Anyway, to think it would give you the first Yggdrasil\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect that.]", "[He certainly has the qualification to receive it.]", "[I acknowledge it.]", "Ifrit nodded in agreement before fixing his posture.", "[Since World Tree-nim acknowledged you, it is only right that we also express our gratitude and respect.]", "Starting with Ifrit, the remaining four Spirit Kings moved.", "Sylphid bowed politely with her hands cupped over her bellybutton, Ea curtsied elegantly with her hand over her chest, and the others each expressed their gratitude in their own way.", "It wasn\u2019t just the Spirit Kings.", "The nearby Spirits that served the Kings also bowed.", "Seol Jihu scratched his cheek. He felt the Spirits\u2019 heartfelt sincerity, but situations like this always made him feel awkward.", "[You revived the god we serve and saved the world we live in. You have the qualification to receive our admiration and worship.]", "Ifrit emphasized once again before suddenly asking.", "[Is there anything you want in particular?]", "\u201cAnything I want?\u201d", "[We want to repay you for everything you\u2019ve done. We will not hesitate to grant any wish as long as it is within our capabilities.]", "Seol Jihu fell into deep thought.", "Even if he was asked for something he wanted, there really wasn\u2019t anything in particular.", "The one thing he could think of was asking the Spirits to give their all in fighting the Parasites, but they seemed eager to do so already.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t really think of\u2014\u201d", "But before he could finish, something butted in from the side.", "Turning around reflexively, Seol Jihu saw the phoenix craning its long neck and jumped in fright.", "\u201cW-What\u2019s up?\u201d", "\u2014Partner, lend me your ear.", "The phoenix quickly whispered, and Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "\u2014You can repeat what I said word by word.", "\u201cBut what does that mean?\u201d", "\u2014What do you think?

Do you plan to dwell on the past after the near-irrecoverable tragedy this world suffered?", "[But.]", "\u2014But, my ass. The Spirit Realm was saved. That was thanks to my partner and his companions.", "The phoenix did not raise its voice, but its mocking tone was clear.", "\u2014But these guys have to leave soon. What if the Parasites attack again? What are you going to do then?", "[That won\u2019t happen.]", "\u2014That won\u2019t happen? What, you\u2019re going to ask for help again?", "Ifrit shut his mouth.", "\u2014As you know, our saving the Spirit Realm this time was thanks to luck, a miracle that happens through multiple overlapping coincidences!", "[Mm\u2026]", "\u2014If you all weren\u2019t so stubborn, we wouldn\u2019t have needed to come here in the first place.

Remember that, idiots.", "Ifrit smacked his lips at the phoenix\u2019s sharp rebuke.", "[I have nothing to say\u2026]", "[I accept that request.]", "As Ifrit muttered bitterly, the Water Spirit King, Aqua, spoke in a serene voice.", "[What Arcus-nim said is right. We made full preparations before facing the Army Commanders, but we were defeated too easily in the end.]", "[Indeed. If we do not change, the same thing will easily happen again.]", "Sylphid agreed with Aqua and also accepted the request.", "[That is one thing we must prevent from happening. The Cave Fairies\u2019 sin cannot be washed away, but we must unseal the two lords in spite of that.]", "With this, two Spirit Kings had voted in favor of Seol Jihu\u2019s request.", "Ifrit turned to the remaining two.", "[Well\u2026 The Cave Fairies and Sky Fairies are already cooperating in the Middle World. I agree that we must prioritize our common enemy first.]", "The Earth Spirit King agreed reluctantly in a somewhat ambiguous way.", "Ea did not say anything. She simply hmphed and turned away. It was clear that she was reluctant, but she seemed to understand that it couldn\u2019t be helped.", "[Since a majority of the Spirit Kings agreed\u2026 Huuu.]", "Ifrit breathed out another deep sigh before looking down at Seol Jihu with a deep gaze.", "[Human, no, our savior.]", "He continued in a clear voice while still hesitating slightly.", "[Is that truly what you wish?]", "\u201cYes, please forgive the Cave Fairies now.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded immediately.", "[In that case\u2026 let it be so. After all, it is our savior\u2019s request\u2026 and one that is ultimately for our benefit.]", "Then, after a moment of hesitation, he spoke with determination.", "[\u2026We accept your request!]", "Baek Haeju and a few others widened their eyes in disbelief.", "[I, Ifrit, representing all Spirits, hereby promise to forgive the Cave Fairies.]", "[From hereon, Ophin\u00fc Odor shall be unsealed, thereby liberating Diffidem Odor as well.]", "[But note, this is not by our will, but wholly by the request of our savior.]", "Philip Muller\u2019s jaw dropped.
