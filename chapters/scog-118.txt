{"cid": "118", "title": "Chapter 118. Result of Stage 1", "content": ["Stage 1 resumed. If anything changed, it was that six out of the seven members took on specific roles, even if it was only a formality.", "The process was a repetition of simple actions. First, Sophie Chalet would open the door and step to the side. Then, they would go in if no enemies could be seen. If there were enemies, Seol Jihu would first throw a Mana Spear before running in and commencing battle. The group would then move to the next room once the clean-up ended.", "Even though Seol Jihu had stepped up to lend Lara and Sophie his hand, it was still true that they were lacking in abilities compared to Straight Face and Snake Eyes.", "But in reality, the speed at which they were clearing the rooms was close to that of Straight Face and Snake Eyes.", "The key to this outcome was Maria. The blonde girl generously used the spells she had been saving up until now to support Seol Jihu. Just as Kim Hannah proclaimed, Maria was a Priest whose professionalism rivaled her love for money. Although she wasn\u2019t happy with Seol Jihu\u2019s decisions, she didn\u2019t forget that he was her employer.", "Plus, Seol Jihu was a pushover who would easily throw out 80 silver coins. Unless he backstabbed her first, she had no reason to refuse to help, just because she disagreed with his decision.", "Maria wondered, \u2018If I supported him without a word of complaint, wouldn\u2019t he offer me another bag of money?\u2019 With this expectation, she focused on supporting him to the best of her abilities.", "As a result, Seol Jihu was able to easily sweep through each room. The battles could be described as overwhelming victories, especially considering Seol Jihu was the only real fighter. However, Seol Jihu himself didn\u2019t think that way.", "\u2018Thank goodness.\u2019", "He credited his success to the intense training he had in Huge Stone Rocky Mountain. Having experienced the Banquet\u2019s first stage, he was finally able to understand Jang Maldong\u2019s words.", "If he had participated in the Banquet as he was two months ago, he would have been out of stamina before he could open just 20 doors. He might have been treated like a burden no different than Lara Wolff and Sophie Chalet.", "But many things changed after the hellish training. Originally, only his Dexterity was Intermediate (Low), but with his Strength and Stamina improving to the same level, the three elements began to work together.", "It was the same with his use of mana. In the past, he had gone all out no matter how strong or weak the enemies were, but now he could control the amount with finesse.", "His repertoire had gone from being crosses, hooks, and uppercuts to finally incorporating jabs. Of course, they were only jabs from Seol Jihu\u2019s perspective. To the enemies who had to face his attacks, his jabs felt like multiple crosses coming in at once.", "In any case, his battle speed had increased significantly. Adding his long-ranged attack method in the form of his Mana Spear, the freezing effect of his close-ranged Ice Spear, and several other artifacts, the power he was displaying far surpassed that of a Level 3.", "And when Seol Jihu really charged through forty doors in a short time, Snake Eyes\u2019 evaluation of \u2018a decently useful guy\u2019 and Straight Face\u2019s evaluation of \u2018new toy\u2019 had no choice but to change.", "Although Seol Jihu fulfilled what he promised Straight Face, he continued to clear the way without a pause. This was partially because he had ample stamina left, but it was also because he wanted to show Straight Face and Snake Eyes through action that he \u2018really wanted to clear Stage 1 as soon as possible\u2019.", "He had no way of knowing how they took this subtle message, but he considered it a success since they stopped their snarky prattling.", "How much time went by? When Seol Jihu finally stopped, he had already cleared over 100 rooms. To be precise, it was 120 rooms.", "Only after clearing three times the number of rooms Straight Face asked for did the young man pause.", "\u2018This room\u2026\u2019", "The number of doors in the room went from three to two. Based on the direction he entered the room, the frontal door and the right-side door had disappeared.", "\u201cHow about we take a break? We can eat something too.\u201d", "Hearing Maria\u2019s words, Seol Jihu shook his head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I can keep\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNo, but I\u2019m not fine.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu looked around the room awkwardly, Maria continued with a dull expression, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about others. Think about the number of doors you opened. Anyone who says a word of complaint is the asshole.\u201d", "Straight Face, who was listening silently, muttered with a chuckle, \u201cHa! That sure sounds like it\u2019s directed at someone, kid.\u201d", "\u201cCall me a kid again and I\u2019ll blow your head off.\u201d Maria struck back without losing an inch. She stayed silent at first since Straight Face was doing all the work, but now that Seol Jihu had taken the lead, she had lost her reason to hold back.", "\u201cOh? Now that\u2019s not a nice thing to say. Don\u2019t people often tell you to watch your mouth?\u201d", "\u201cMind your own business. What\u2019s that got to do with you?\u201d", "\u201cYou know what\u2019s a good way to fix anger management issues? How about it? I\u2019m starting to think I want to help you fix it.\u201d", "\u201cHm, not really. You don\u2019t look stronger than Agnes anyways.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d Straight Face furrowed her brows. \u201cClaire Agnes?\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s take a break.\u201d Sensing that the conversation was heading in a hostile direction, Seol Jihu quickly intervened.", "Maria, who had her hair up like an irritated cat, harrumphed and turned away when Seol Jihu patted her back. While Maria sat down in the corner of the room and munched on dried meat, Seol Jihu fell in thought as he observed the room quietly.", "For the first time since they entered Stage 1, they had lost the ability to pick a direction. The way the frontal and right side walls were closed off, it was as if he was looking at a corner.", "\u2018Wait\u2026 corner?\u2019", "A theory popped up into his head. At that moment, a small ruckus buzzed out.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Did you finally lose your mind?\u201d", "\u201cJust let me see it.\u201d", "\u201cLook at yours. I know you drew one too.\u201d", "\u201cI only started in the middle, so I don\u2019t know the beginning part. I just need to see it for a moment. Please?\u201d", "Lara and Snake Eyes were arguing. Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know what happened, but it looked like Lara was the one bothering Snake Eyes. Until a moment ago, it looked like she wanted nothing to do with Snake Eyes and Straight Face, so what had gotten into her?", "\u201c1 minute, no, 30 seconds is enough.\u201d", "\u201cScrew off. Are you crazy? What, you gained some confidence because Prince Charming over there fondled your anus?\u201d", "\u201cDo you have to talk like that? I\u2019m asking because I want to help. Besides, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s anything hard.\u201d", "Snake Eyes chuckled as if she found Lara\u2019s statement laughable. Shortly afterward, she relaxed her arms. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not hard.\u201d", "\u201cThen!\u201d", "\u201cSure, take it.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d", "When Lara asked, Snake Eyes grinned. \u201cI hate being hassled, so just take it.\u201d", "\u201cWhere is it?\u201d", "\u201cHere~\u201d", "Snake Eyes gestured at her half-open jacket with her eyes. To be exact, she was pointing to her bountiful cleavage that boasted a deep ravine.", "Lara was startled. \u201cWh-Wh-What? Are you joking?\u201d", "\u201cNot at all~ You said you wanted to see the map I put in great effort to make. Is taking it yourself that difficult?\u201d", "\u201cIs it fun teasing people?\u201d", "\u201cYes, very. It\u2019s so fun I might die.\u201d", "When Snake Eyes snickered, Lara muttered, \u201cKeuk\u201d, and seethed in anger. Snake Eyes crossed her arms and tilted her chin up slightly.", "\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not going to take it? Then don\u2019t~\u201d", "Lara fumed, but she still brought her trembling hand up.", "Seol Jihu kept his eyes on the duo in case a problem broke out. It was then that he felt someone staring at him fixedly. When he turned around, he saw Straight Face staring at him with faint, manner-less eyes. She was right in front of him, having approached him before he noticed.", "\u201cCan we talk for a moment?\u201d", "\u201cTalk?\u201d", "\u201cYes. And let\u2019s move over to a quieter place.\u201d", "Straight Face glanced at the left door, which had not yet been opened. Then, she began to move towards it before Seol Jihu could say a word. A monster howled the moment she opened the door, but it collapsed with a mournful cry after a couple of flashes of light.", "Thud. Straight Face kicked the headless corpse of the monster before glancing at Seol Jihu and disappearing into the room.", "Even though Seol Jihu had seen her quickdraw countless times by now, it was just as terrifying now as it was in the beginning.", "When he entered the room leaving behind several gazes, he saw Straight Face sitting against the wall. In that short period of time, she had taken care of the remaining monsters in the room.", "\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Come sit.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded and sat down next to her.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Straight Face closed her eyes before slowly opening her mouth, \u201cPeople often tell you that you don\u2019t know how to read the air, right?\u201d", "\u201cYou told me to come sit.\u201d", "Hearing the young man speak like he had been wrongly accused, the young woman looked up at the ceiling. Soon, a deep sigh escaped her mouth.", "After a brief silence, she spoke again, \u201cNow that I\u2019ve seen how you play, I understand why you were so bold.\u201d", "\u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d", "\u201cYep.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, but it would still be nice if a certain someone helped out.\u201d", "Hearing Seol Jihu\u2019s subtle suggestion, a smile appeared on her face. She faced the young man and spoke with a delicate smile, \u201cI\u2019ve put some thought into it and I think you\u2019re right.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re only at Stage 1. Clearing it quickly will be convenient\u2026. That\u2019s why I wanted to ask.\u201d", "With Straight Face being oddly submissive, Seol Jihu became worried. He was being sarcastic when he asked her to help him. Now, he somewhat regretted that decision.", "\u201cYou, me, and that snake. Why don\u2019t the three of us go?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "\u201cAh, you can bring that kid too if you want. She\u2019s infuriating, but she does seem to have some skill.\u201d", "\u201cThat sounds like you want to abandon the other three.\u201d", "Straight Face smiled, \u201cYep, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. You can even include that Priest of Invidia. She might seem useless now, but we never know.\u201d", "\u201cBy that logic, Miss Lara and Miss Sophie should also\u2014\u201d", "\u201cAre you joking?\u201d Straight Face cut him off as if he had just told the funniest joke.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t take you to be a fool who would place a Warrior and an Archer on the same level of importance as a Priest.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was about to disagree and call that a flawed argument, when\u2026.", "\u201cPlus, you know more than anyone else that those two aren\u2019t useful.\u201d", "He became speechless.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to think so hard. I get how strong you are, so just support me as you did in the beginning. I\u2019ll also give it my all, and we should be able to get through this place in no time.\u201d", "Seeing that the young man had fallen silent, she continued with a look of joy on her face, \u201cIf this stage really has a time limit, or if it\u2019s advantageous to get to Stage 2 faster, wouldn\u2019t it be better to do as I say?\u201d", "She wasn\u2019t wrong. If Straight Face and Snake Eyes participated at full power, their speed would increase significantly. Maria would also be able to save her spells. However, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but think that this was all an excuse.", "Seol Jihu stared fixedly at the woman.", "\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d", "And just as he expected, she was looking at him with eyes full of anticipation. He felt like she was testing him. Although he couldn\u2019t be sure, he had a strong hunch that this woman simply wanted to see him abandon the two women or, at the very least, retract the offer he made.", "\u2018What a personality.\u2019 Seol Jihu grumbled inwardly while clearing his throat. This wasn\u2019t all too surprising. After all, he didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of expectation to clear Stage 1 so peacefully. Since he couldn\u2019t fully stitch up the wound, he expected a critical moment like this to come.", "\u201cYes, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Seol Jihu opened his mouth, \u201cI think it\u2019s better to bring them all with us.\u201d", "\u201cHnng. Well, I\u2019ll be looking forward to it.\u201d Straight Face let out a nasal hum as if she had expected this answer. \u201cSo, how are you going to console me?\u201d", "\u201cI think you mean persuade.\u201d", "\u201cWell, go ahead.\u201d", "\u201cFirst, you know that this Banquet is different from the previous ones, yes?\u201d Seol Jihu didn\u2019t want to prolong this conversation, so he cut straight to the chase.", "\u201cYou mean the fact that teams were separated.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d Seol Jihu continued, \u201cBut why? This has never happened before in the history of the Banquet.\u201d", "Straight Face didn\u2019t react. Taking this to mean that she was listening attentively, Seol Jihu got to his main point, \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed that something is strange?\u201d", "\u201cStrange?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t you think this Stage 1 is too easy?\u201d", "Straight Face\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve cleared 160 rooms so far, but none of them felt particularly difficult. In fact, they were all so-so.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThe problem is that Stage 1 and Stage 2 have never been considered easy in the history of the Banquet.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re getting at.\u201d", "As a reply, Seol Jihu began to recite a summary of all the past Stage 1s\u2014", "That the participants were allowed to enter the past four Banquets as teams, and that Stage 1 had been difficult from the very beginning. Also, according to the records, every member of a team had to work together to barely scrape by.", "\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the Banquet imposed cooperation among the members who entered through the same entrance. If we were in their shoes, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to abandon a team member so easily. After all, unless someone was a total troll, every head would be important.\u201d", "However, this Banquet was the opposite. Teams were separated, and Stage 1\u2019s difficult rate dropped significantly.", "\u201cMaybe the difficulty dropped because of the separation of teams.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a possibility, but it\u2019s too convenient of an answer.\u201d Seol Jihu shook his head at Straight Face\u2019s counterargument. \u201cCooperation was the only factor that remained unchanged in the past Stage 1s and 2s. This Banquet is the first time the need to cooperate disappeared. I believe that this is a trap.\u201d", "Although Straight Face did not notice, her eyes were widened to a circle. Her previous statement had been a lighthearted teasing, but the answer surpassed her imagination and made her mind reel.", "\u201cSo\u2026.\u201d Straight Face murmured as if she was talking to herself, \u201cWe\u2019ll fall into the trap the moment we abandon someone.\u201d", "\u201cExactly.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201d Straight Face tilted her head slightly and mulled over the idea. She was intelligent and surely wasn\u2019t a fool. She didn\u2019t take Seol Jihu\u2019s words lightly.", "\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying\u2026 but it does sound a bit forced\u2026.\u201d She tilted her head side to side before asking a sharp question, \u201cWhat made you think this?\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips. He couldn\u2019t just say, \u2018Because this entire area has the color of the Golden Rule.\u2019 He had to make her understand some other way.", "He didn\u2019t need to think for too long. Since what the white-hairband girl said gave him the idea in the first place, he could just tell her about that. Of course, he couldn\u2019t just say to her face, \u2018You\u2019re the self-centered maverick.\u2019 So, he changed the words around a little.", "\u201cCounterparts, is it\u2026.\u201d Thankfully, what the frail girl told him was enough to pique her interest.", "Straight Face rubbed her chin more seriously than ever before. After thinking for a long time, she glanced at the young man who was anxiously waiting for an answer.", "\u201cOur prince,\u201d leisurely sweeping her hair back, she opened her cherry-red lips, \u201c\u2026sure has a way with words.\u201d", "\u2018I wish you\u2019d stop calling me a prince.\u2019 Seol Jihu smiled bitterly.", "\u201cIyaa~ This is hard.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep tugging them along. It will only be until Stage 1 ends.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right, but\u2026. With my personality, letting them hitch a free ride is\u2014\u201d", "It was then\u2026.", "\u2014Woooooooow!", "Before Straight Face could even finish her sentence, a loud cheer broke out in the room next door.", "The duo\u2019s gazes went up simultaneously."]}
