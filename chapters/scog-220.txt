But realizing that it had something to do with whatever she would bring up next, Seol Jihu listened carefully.", "Roselle must not have been expecting an answer as she continued calmly.", "\u201cMagic refers to the act of using mana, a power unique to humans, to carry out incomprehensible feats. Witchcraft is the technique of manifesting all kinds of phenomena by borrowing the power of supernatural existences or other mystical powers.\u201d", "She continued explaining clearly and concisely.", "\u201cWhat I call sorcery is a new discipline that combines these two together.\u201d", "She then turned her head and smiled at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cIt is also the reason I came to be called a witch.\u201d", "Seol Jihu reflected on what she said before asking.", "\u201cYou mean\u2026 you, Lady Roselle, founded the discipline of sorcery?\u201d", "\u201cYes. When I was alive, the Empire treated me as a heretic and a thorn on the side because of it.\u201d", "Roselle spoke as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal, and Seol Jihu had a puzzled expression.", "\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t witchcraft a discipline too?\u201d", "\u201cThe Empire as a nation was built with magic as its foundation.\u201d", "Roselle replied with an unprecedented stiffness.", "\u201cA nation of magic, by magic, and for magic. They only allowed their people to walk the path of a Mage. All other disciplines were targets to be eliminated.\u201d", "Roselle furtively bit her lip.", "\u201cWitchcraft was especially persecuted. Not only did its practitioners not worship the Empire\u2019s gods, but individual worship of idols was also regarded as sacrilege during that period\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu finally caught a glimpse of why Roselle resented the Empire so much. While he couldn\u2019t be certain, it seemed Roselle suffered something similar to a witch hunt when she was alive.", "Wasn\u2019t that why she wanted to uproot the Empire, whose foundations were based on magic?", "\u201cLet me say this in case you are misunderstanding me. I do not hate magic. Whether it be magic or witchcraft, I believe that they are both fascinating disciplines. I simply hated the Empire\u2019s sole emphasis on magic.\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026 then couldn\u2019t you have just left the Empire and take asylum elsewhere?\u201d", "\u201cWhere? The Empire\u2019s influence was spread throughout the entire continent. What nation would have accepted me? My only choice would have been to live in exile in a hideout where no one could find me.\u201d", "Roselle heaved out a small sigh.", "\u201cAs long as you are born a citizen of the Empire, you must follow its laws. Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wrong. But, I absolutely could not abandon witchcraft. For one reason.\u201d", "Roselle hesitated for a long time, then seemingly made up her mind and spoke.", "\u201cYou see, I am not a native inhabitant of this world.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was taken aback by her shocking confession.", "\u201cLet me rephrase myself. I was certainly born and raised in Paradise, but the Grazia House\u2019s ancestor is not from this world. She was an inhabitant of another world but was banished to Paradise after getting wrapped up in an incident.\u201d", "Roselle shrugged.", "\u201cThough it may be hard to believe, it is true. The records left behind by our ancestor clearly said so.\u201d", "Seol Jihu realized that this wasn\u2019t anything to be surprised about. Thinking about it now, he was in the same position.", "\u2018Still, another world\u2026.\u2019", "Suddenly intrigued, Seol Jihu asked.", "\u201cWhat is that world called?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2014 The records say it is called Hall Plane[1].\u201d", "\u201cHall Plane\u2026 Then how did your ancestor end up getting banished to Paradise?\u201d", "\u201cMy ancestor seemed to have been both the hero and saintess of that world. Joining hands with three comrades, she overcame all sorts of obstacles and hardships to save humanity. It is truly a fairytale-like story.\u201d", "Roselle explained slowly as if she was telling a folktale to a child.", "\u201cBut the after story of the fairytale was awfully cruel.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cOnce everything ended, the Magician of the party revealed his lascivious desire for the Fairy Queen. Not only did he kidnap the Fairy Queen, but he also kidnapped the Hero, whom she was engaged to, and held them captive in his base.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was taken aback. The story that was full of hopes and dreams suddenly turned into a tragedy.", "\u201cSaintess Grazia, who later found out what happened, led her troops to the traitor\u2019s base to rescue her two comrades. Unfortunately, the rescue ended in failure. Not only were her troops defeated in an overwhelming fashion, but dimensional travel was forcefully cast on the Saintess. In essence, she was banished from her world.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "Seol Jihu belatedly realized his mistake. He had ended up asking more than what was necessary because he was intrigued.", "Smiling bashfully, he spoke.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "\u201cNo, this is one of the reasons I revolted against the Empire.\u201d", "One of the reasons for revolting. As soon as Seol Jihu heard these words, he came up with a conjecture.", "\u201cLady Roselle\u2026 Did you want to return to Hall Plane?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You\u2019re very perceptive.\u201d", "Roselle smiled gently.", "\u201cYes, I did. But rather than yearning to go\u2026 I probably wanted to escape reality. I was also curious and didn\u2019t really like this world.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cBut dimensional travel isn\u2019t easy, you know? Rather, it\u2019s something that mere mortals wouldn\u2019t dare to dream about.\u201d", "She was right. Earthlings were able to enter Paradise through the power of Paradise\u2019s gods. In other words, one would have to have power on par with gods to be able to accomplish something similar.", "\u201cI came to a conclusion after long deliberation. That if I couldn\u2019t leave this unfair world, I would change it myself. For the sake of future generations, I would provide a climate where anyone can share their knowledge and understanding of any discipline. And to do that, the Empire, which built itself atop the path of magic, had to be destroyed.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s brows perked up.", "Changing the world.", "Those words continuously echoed in his ears.", "\u201cThat\u2019s why I attempted to combine magic and witchcraft. Because at that moment, I wished for a new, formidable power that no one else had. Of course, other people told me I was crazy and did their best to stop me, but\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s incredible!\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t hide his admiration. Roselle blinked blankly, pausing mid-sentence.", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cSo you tried something no one else has ever done and succeeded in pioneering an independent field!\u201d", "What Roselle said truly held great significance to Seol Jihu. He was struggling to become a True High Ranker, and he felt like he finally found a lead.", "That wasn\u2019t all. The two of them were surprisingly similar in more ways than one.", "Seol Jihu also wanted to change Paradise, expelling the Parasites and a portion of humanity in the process.", "But seeing how flustered Roselle was, Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "\u201cAh, did I say something rude\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cN-No\u2026 I\u2026 I just didn\u2019t expect you to really think that\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen such a reaction.\u201d", "Roselle stuttered greatly.", "\u201c\u2026My apologies. In the past, everyone had the same reaction when I said this.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d", "\u201cThat I was full of myself.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve also heard \u2018crazy bitch\u2019, \u2018insane\u2019, \u2018screw off\u2019, and \u2018aigoo~ girl, you\u2019re driving me crazy!\u2019\u201d", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t sure about the others, but he felt like he knew who said the last line.", "\u201cErm\u2026 this is the first time I\u2019ve been praised\u2026 W-What I\u2019m saying is that it was pretty nice.\u201dRoselle stole glances at Seol Jihu, then cleared her throat and put on airs.", "\u201cKuhum. Yes! It is indeed incredible! Miracle bestows the bridge known as chance to those who strive. With heaven\u2019s providence, I was able to open up a new realm. You don\u2019t understand how deeply moved I was when I first chanced upon the Origin\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOrigin?\u201d", "\u201cThe Origin is\u2026\u201d", "Roselle quickly shut her mouth in the middle of her speech.", "\u201cThe Origin is\u2026\u201d", "She hesitated. It didn\u2019t look like she was hesitant to tell him. Rather, the concept seemed too difficult and boundless for her to explain with simple words.", "After a long time\u2026", "\u201cThe rising of the sun and the setting of the moon.\u201d", "Roselle quietly opened her mouth.", "\u201cWhen the moon rises, the sun sets. Water flows down from top to bottom. The fundamental principles and the causes of the natural phenomena of the world are known as the Origin.\u201d", "She seemed more serious and careful than ever before.", "\u201cIn truth, even I don\u2019t know much about the Origin. Of course, I am proud of my achievement in making contact with it as a mere mortal, but from the perspective of the entire universe, I had already set one foot in the door.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was suddenly relieved to not have chosen the path of a Magician. It was because he didn\u2019t understand a thing Roselle just said.", "\u201cI only gained the most basic qualification to explore it\u2026\u201d", "Roselle suddenly stopped pacing around. Seol Jihu noticed that his surroundings had gotten dark. They must have arrived at a specific destination while absorbed in their conversation.", "\u201cThis is\u2014\u201d", "The place seemed to be a royal chamber of sorts, and Roselle was walking up a staircase leading to an altar.", "\u201cThe spring of bottomless wisdom and the proof that I touched the edge of the Origin.\u201d", "A fist-sized orb was floating by itself on the square altar, radiating a delicate glow of a firefly.", "Roselle stood in front of the altar and caressed the glowing orb preciously. Next, she turned back to Seol Jihu and revealed the identity of the light with a flushed voice.", "\u201cI call this the Eternal Light of Wisdom.\u201d", "She then continued.", "\u201cI\u2019ve thought a lot about it, really.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI had only two wishes in my life\u2014 dimensional travel and the fall of the Empire. But I failed to achieve them both.\u201d", "One was a wish that she could not fulfill, and the other was a wish that could not be fulfilled.", "Roselle tilted her head up and stared at the ceiling.", "\u201cHow should I say this\u2026 I haven\u2019t felt such a sense of loss for a long time. I went so far as to employ an expedient to become an immortal existence, all to wait and wait again\u2026\u201d", "Roselle\u2019s deeply-rooted hatred had served as a driving force that allowed her to persevere. But with Seol Jihu telling her the truth, her hatred now had nowhere to go.", "If she had a living body, the shock would have relegated her to the bed, sick.", "\u201cThe fall of the Empire is an undeniable truth. There is no longer a reason for me to exist. But\u2026\u201d", "Roselle stared blankly before opening her mouth.", "\u201cI also hated the idea of simply disappearing in vain.\u201d", "With a bitter expression, she stroked the Eternal Light of Wisdom.", "\u201cI mean, wouldn\u2019t you feel the same way? The Grazia bloodline ended in my generation. The name disappearing in both Paradise and Hall Plane without leaving behind a trace\u2026 that\u2019s too sad and frustrating.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI devoted my life, sacrificing my mind and body to achieve what I did.\u201d", "Afraid of losing the fruit of years of labor and effort. With that, Roselle closed her mouth.", "Seol Jihu maintained his silence as well. Not wanting to disappear into the mists of history. Seol Jihu could empathize with this.", "\u201cSo I decided. Now that things have come to this, I will at least leave behind proof that I, Roselle La Grazia, existed in this world. I will leave behind a trace of the House of Grazia.\u201d", "After a long silence, Roselle stared at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cSo, I have just one request for you.\u201d", "She finally got to the point.", "\u201cCan you bring me someone with talent in this discipline?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened at her unexpected request.", "\u201cDiscipline?\u201d", "\u201cYes, someone who can accept the Eternal Light of Wisdom. Simply put, someone to become my successor.\u201d", "Seol Jihu subconsciously stared at the orb of light. A powerful attraction seemed to suck him in, so he quickly averted his gaze.", "\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2026.\u2019", "Her request this time was a thousand times easier than something as absurd as asking to destroy the Empire, but just how many people would understand the value of this orb of light? After all, even he wasn\u2019t so sure.", "\u201cIf someone accepts that light\u2026 mm, how should I say this\u2026 will that person become different from an ordinary Magician?\u201d", "\u201cDifferent?\u201d", "Roselle\u2019s voice went up at once. The way her cheeks turned red, it almost seemed like Seol Jihu just insulted her. But knowing that Seol Jihu didn\u2019t mean any harm, she stopped at a simple snort.", "\u201cIt will be more correct to say they\u2019re distinct.\u201d", "She spoke firmly as if it wasn\u2019t worth mentioning a second time.", "\u201cOf course, I can\u2019t say the realm I achieved is the best. But the Eye of Heaven, which can catch a glimpse of the Origin, is an innate power that only a few chosen are born with, and the Third Eye, which can even see through this heaven, is a heaven-beyond-heaven power. There is no need to even mention it. At least, when we\u2019re talking about human capabilities.\u201d", "It was yet another thing that didn\u2019t make any sense. Seol Jihu blamed himself for asking something he shouldn\u2019t have.", "\u201cSince the Eternal Light of Wisdom is largely affected by one\u2019s bloodline, their innate qualities greatly affect their affinity to it. But that doesn\u2019t mean a random person can acquire this ability through effort. Even the few who have talent must endeavor for a lifetime just to have a chance of grasping it.\u201d", "She babbled on, then glanced sideways.", "When Seol Jihu sang about how great she was, putting her on a pedestal, she hunched her shoulders and shook her head. Then, she strutted her chest out.", "\u201cGoing back to the main point, my successor would be in a different position. He or she would only need to take my mastery in sorcery in full. With my help, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.\u201d", "Just as Seol Jihu was about to ask, \u2018What about me?\u2019", "\u201cOf course, I would be elated if he or she had a natural talent, but I would really love for this person to be hard-working and constantly striving to study this discipline.\u201d", "But after hearing what she said next, he swallowed his words.", "There was a saying that having too much was as bad as having too little.", "He was struggling to reach the realm Jang Maldong told him about, so he had no confidence in being able to digest the Eternal Light of Wisdom.", "Most importantly, he wanted to pioneer a new realm, rather than following in the tracks of a realm that someone else created.", "\u2018Wait.\u2019", "At that moment, Seol Jihu suddenly thought of something and flinched.", "\u2018Isn\u2019t that coming up?\u2019", "Soon, the March Neutral Zone, which currently held unprecedented attention of Paradise, would open.", "If Seol Jihu could recruit a talented Earthling, he would be able to have Paradise\u2019s sole Sorcerer as his comrade.", "It was only then that Seol Jihu realized how great a fortune he had chanced upon.", "\u201cIt looks like our interests coincide.\u201d", "Roselle smiled, having read Seol Jihu\u2019s thoughts.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll accept this young lady\u2019s request, yes?\u201d", "\u201cYes. But it may take a while.\u201d", "\u201cYou can take your time.\u201d", "Roselle replied with a bitter smile.", "\u201cI have waited for hundreds of years already. Waiting a few dozen more won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d", "\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to wait that long.

Anyway, I\u2019m glad.\u201d", "Roselle looked relieved.", "\u201cSo once I find the successor, I just have to bring them here?\u201d", "\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d", "Roselle stared at the pendant hanging on Seol Jihu\u2019s neck.", "\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for us to keep in touch?\u201d", "\u201cIs there a way we can do that?\u201d", "\u201cOf course!\u2019", "Roselle shouted with a bright, cheerful expression.", "\u201cSorcery has the power of creation as its foundation. It can achieve all sorts of wondrous things!\u201d", "Skipping toward Seol Jihu, she placed her hand on his Pendant before taking it off. Once a faint trace of light momentarily fogged up the jewel, she smiled furtively.", "\u2018What did she do?\u2019", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not so shameless as to force myself in when there\u2019s already a lady of the house.\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked back as always. Roselle chuckled, then looked down.", "\u201cIt looks like your comrades have finished packing up the inheritance.\u201d", "\u201cAlready?\u201d", "\u201cYes, they are grumbling about you not coming back.

I am not trying to flatter you. The taste of a heartfelt praise is really\u2026\u201d", "She trailed off, then asked with a beaming smile.", "\u201cAh, right. I gave up on the pendant, so please, do forgive me if I show up in your dreams every once in a while.\u201d", "Now what did this mean?", "Seol Jihu raised a question, but Roselle didn\u2019t answer. She simply put on a strange expression.", "\u201cFufu, your comrades are getting anxious.\u201d", "Roselle slowly raised her arms.", "\u201cThen, until the next time we meet, I pray for your well-being.\u201d", "Her dreamy voice flowed out like music.
