Fire!!\u201d", "It was the same for the flurry of arrows that flew in parabolas.", "The spectral army even phased through the bodies of Haramark\u2019s infantry, crossing their line of defense and swinging their weapons freely.", "At a glance, it looked like thousands of Flones were charging forward.", "\u201cYou thought we would clash with you?\u201d", "Unsightly Humility beheaded a screaming soldier while bursting out with laughter.", "\u201cI don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t!
