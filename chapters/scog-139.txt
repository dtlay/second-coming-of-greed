Coincidently, Jang Maldong was sitting on the office sofa as if he had been waiting for him.", "\u201cSo I heard you want to be the team leader?\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared at him with a dumbfounded expression after Jang Maldong spoke up. Jang Maldong\u2019s face reddened, realizing he had gone ahead himself.", "\u201cChohong told me.\u201d", "Seol Jihu let out an empty laugh.

She has an innate talent as an Archer, not to mention that her learning speed is also extremely fast.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re praising her unceasingly. But can you say the same if you hadn\u2019t known her?\u201d", "\u201cYes. And Seol-Ah\u2019s evaluation was done by Agnes, not me.
