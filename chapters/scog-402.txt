You could get hurt!\u201d", "A man stood in amazement near the construction site where the Dwarves were busy tearing down buildings and rebuilding them from scratch.", "\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. Wait, did you just say you\u2019re a trainee? No way! I\u2019ve been in the construction business for more than twenty years, and let me just say, your skills are far too amazing for a trainee.\u201d", "\u201cHmph! Twenty years is nothing. And don\u2019t make me laugh! The master blacksmiths are on their way here, and when you see their work you\u2019ll want to take back what you just said!\u201d", "\u201cR-Really? Do you mind if I watch? I won\u2019t bother them. I\u2019ll even run errands for them!\u201d", "\u201cHmph! Didn\u2019t I just say it\u2019s dangerous here? If you really want to help, go sit under the shade over there and bring us some beer during the break!\u201d", "The young Dwarf\u2019s tone was blunt, but not malicious.", "Rather, he seemed flattered by the human\u2019s praise, made apparent by the smile tugging at the corner of his lips.", "Seol Jihu watched the Dwarf and the human and nodded before moving on.", "The construction site wasn\u2019t the only place where exchanges between the Federation and humanity were taking place.", "On the street, an Earthling woman took a piece of chocolate out of her pocket and carefully handed it to a crying Foxman child in his mother\u2019s arms.", "The Foxman child, drawn to the sweet scent, stopped at once and began sniffing, his eyes wide open. The child licked the chocolate on the woman\u2019s palm as if he had never tasted one before.", "As a huge smile spread across the child\u2019s face, the mother thanked the woman, who then waved shyly at the child.", "Those who were watching couldn\u2019t help but smile.", "Seol Jihu, too, smiled softly and continued down the street.", "\u2018They really are amazing.\u2019", "Looking down at the neatly paved sidewalk, Seol Jihu was filled with awe.", "The Dwarves began with construction the day they arrived in Eva.", "Worried that the Dwarves might overexert themselves, Seol Jihu had suggested they rest a few days before starting work. But the answer he received from the Dwarf craftsman was unexpected.", "[You want us to rest in this building? Don\u2019t make me laugh.]", "[I know you said that out of consideration for us, but do you have any idea how we feel right now?]", "[It\u2019s like we have a diary full of our embarrassing secrets spread wide open on the table for everyone to read.]", "[In other words, we can\u2019t stop thinking about it. There\u2019s no way we can rest knowing that the diary is still out there, so we\u2019d rather take care of it first.]", "Seol Jihu no longer felt the need to stop them when he saw the satisfied looks on their faces after they had taken all the bricks off from the sidewalk, polished them, then put them back one by one.", "In any case, thanks to the meticulous nature and delicate skills of the Dwarves, Eva became more and more beautiful day by day.", "Of course, they couldn\u2019t have repaired 80 percent of all roads in a week without the Eastern Spring Merchants, who provided them with the necessary resources, and the royal family of Eva, who opened up the pre-secured territories, including the royal sites, to the members of the Federation.", "In addition, the Sky Fairy\u2019s shop was due to open in about two days, thanks to the huge wealth Seol Jihu had offered Eva.", "Kim Hannah worried that the change might be too radical but nevertheless did not oppose it.", "She knew that the success of Seol Jihu\u2019s plan depended on how well the Federation adapted to Eva and how prosperous Eva became.", "\u2018Still\u2026.\u2019", "After a tour of the city, Seol Jihu, standing in front of Valhalla\u2019s front gate, smiled bitterly.", "\u2018They didn\u2019t have to make them so big and magnificent.\u2019", "The Valhalla building was huge from the start, but now its splendor was comparable to the Taj Mahal after the Dwarves added various ornaments to it.", "\u2018Hmm? What\u2019s that?\u2019", "Seol Jihu frowned while looking around the construction site.", "Vidalif was carving a huge stone statue in the garden by himself.", "He seemed completely focused on his work as he moved his hands with the utmost caution, sweating profusely.", "The statue seemed like it would be a good addition to the garden, but somehow it looked familiar.", "The statue was of a man holding a spear, bending his arm back above his head.", "\u2018Wait. Is that me?\u2019", "Seol Jihu began to blink rapidly.", "He couldn\u2019t be sure with just the hair and the face, but the Spear of Purity and other equipment were definite giveaways.", "The Dwarf was most definitely carving a statue of Seol Jihu aiming his spear at the Parasite Queen.", "There was no way Seol Jihu could stop him now.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face turned red.", "\u2018Damn it. Of all the models he could have chosen, why did he choose me?\u2019", "He shook his head and looked down at the rice cakes with a sigh.", "\u201cHey, rainbow rice cake. You agree with me, right?\u201d", "\u201cKkiing?\u201d", "The white rice cake with black stripes tilted its head.", "*", "Haramark\u2019s most popular pub, Eat, Drink, And Enjoy was bustling with people as always.", "\u201cValhalla\u2019s been annoying lately.\u201d", "A man sitting at a log table grumbled softly, pouring liquor into his cup.", "\u201cThey want to manage our settings? Are they really Earthlings like us? I just don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re supporting Eva\u2026.\u201d", "He emptied the contents of his cup into his mouth and frowned.", "\u201cI mean, isn\u2019t their target Sinyoung? Why should we suffer in the process?\u201d", "Two other men at the same table nodded in agreement.", "\u201cAnd now the Federation wants to settle in Eva\u2026. I have no idea what\u2019s going on anymore.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. Aside from everything else, the fact that the Federation wants to settle in Eva\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a bad thing.\u201d", "When the man complained again, the only woman at the table of four remarked carefully.", "One of the men looked at her, as if he had just remembered something.", "\u201cThat\u2019s right, you said you visited Eva the other day. How was it?\u201d", "\u201cHuhu. Get ready to have your mind blown away.\u201d", "With a grin, the woman took off the bow on her back and placed it on the table, as if she had been waiting for this question.", "The men widened their eyes.", "\u201cOh? You changed your bow?\u201d", "\u201cThe day I arrived in Eva was the day the Sky Fairies\u2019 shop opened up. I was curious, so I went to take a look and ended up buying some of their stuff.\u201d", "\u201cIs this bow any good?\u201d", "\u201cYou have no idea. My old bow doesn\u2019t even compare to it. You see, the wooden part of this bow is made from the branches of the World Tree.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cSurprised, eh? You know that the World Tree is a sacred ash tree, right? When you fix an arrow on this bow, it\u2019s instantly infused with an anti-evil attribute that has a very powerful effect on the Parasites, not to mention undead monsters. So how could I resist?\u201d", "The woman beamed and the man exclaimed in amazement.", "\u201cWow\u2026. It must have been expensive.\u201d", "\u201cNo, it actually wasn\u2019t as expensive as I\u2019d expected.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "\u201cYeah. It did cost more than the longbow but was still very affordable. They didn\u2019t deliberately break the World Tree\u2019s branches, but only used branches that had naturally fallen during its growth. And I got a grand opening discount, too.\u201d", "\u201cIs this all you got?\u201d", "\u201cOf course not.\u201d", "The next thing she showed them was her quiver, and inside it were arrows with colorful feathers.", "\u201cTa-da. Take a look! These arrows have been infused with the power of the Spirits.\u201d", "\u201cSpirits?\u201d", "\u201cYup! It\u2019s made from Fallen Angels\u2019 feathers infused with the five Spirits\u2019 power. With this, I can shoot fire arrows and wind arrows like Magicians do. So, what do you think? Pretty cool, huh?\u201d", "The eyes of the men looking at the bow and arrows began to glow with admiration.", "\u201cBut my biggest achievement\u2026\u201d", "The woman was far from done.", "She grabbed a particularly long arrow from the quiver and carefully held it up for everyone to see.", "\u201c\u2026Is this. This is a limited edition arrow\u2014they only had ten in stock. They held an impromptu archery competition and allowed only the top 10 customers to purchase one arrow each. I managed to secure one by placing ninth.\u201d", "There was something ominous about the way the arrowhead glowed blue under the light.", "The man gave a light chuckle.", "\u201cWhy is this such a big deal? I see the arrowhead is blue.\u201d", "\u201cOh, it\u2019s Thunder.\u201d", "\u201cW-What?\u201d", "The man\u2019s eyes shot open and he quickly pulled himself back.", "The other two did the same.", "The woman burst into laughter and waved a hand.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. It\u2019s made from the same material but safe.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s only a little bit mixed in the arrowhead, so technically it\u2019s not even a Thunder. Still\u2026.\u201d", "The woman smiled and carefully rubbed the arrowhead with her thumb.", "\u201cIn terms of destructive power, it doesn\u2019t even compare to the other arrows. Hit a weak spot, and even a Medusa will explode.\u201d", "She raised the arm holding the arrow in a shooting position.", "\u201cOne visit to Eva, and you\u2019re head over heels for it.\u201d", "The man who was the first to complain said nonchalantly.", "\u201cMaybe you should just move there.\u201d", "The woman paused.", "With a sigh, she carefully placed the arrow back into the quiver.", "\u201cWhy do you have to say it like that?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t you know that what you\u2019re doing right now is helping them? First, you visit Eva, and now you\u2019re advertising their merchandise! How could you, with everything that\u2019s going on? Are you out of your mind?\u201d", "\u201cWhy would I be out of my mind? I\u2019m just expressing satisfaction with what I bought. Should I be lying about how I feel?\u201d", "The woman said in a firm voice.", "\u201cAnd technically, Valhalla did nothing wrong.\u201d", "\u201cI never said they did. But why are they meddling with our\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s because Sinyoung is doing nothing to root out humanity\u2019s defectors. Recent events have proven that there are traitors among us, and I believe they should be eradicated.\u201d", "\u201cWow. Who could\u2019ve imagined that one visit to Eva would make you a Valhalla advocate?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not their advocate. I\u2019m just saying they\u2019re pretty reasonable.\u201d", "The man mocked, but the woman remained calm.", "\u201cAnd the Seven Gods designated only criminals as targets for the settings evaluations. We haven\u2019t committed any crime, and we never will. So this doesn\u2019t affect us.\u201d", "The woman shrugged.", "\u201cHmph. Except we will. They\u2019re saying if we don\u2019t respond to their draft call, we\u2019ll be branded as criminals.\u201d", "The man snorted.", "\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026. But their decision does make sense.\u201d", "She put her hand on the new bow.", "After a moment of hesitation, she spoke with a sigh.", "\u201cActually\u2026 well, I haven\u2019t decided for sure, but I\u2019m thinking of joining the war.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while. You\u2019re right. I might have changed after visiting Eva.\u201d", "The woman continued.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck at Level 4 for some time now. Are we going to stay like this forever? Level 5s get a completely different treatment. Shouldn\u2019t we aim for High Rank before it\u2019s too late?\u201d", "\u201cBefore it\u2019s too late?\u201d", "\u201cYes, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d", "The woman cleared her throat.", "\u201cListen. From now on, Paradise will revolve around Eva and other cities that accept the Federation. Why? Because of this.\u201d", "She tapped on the bow and the quiver.", "\u201cRemember what it was like to buy new equipment until now? Every time we leveled up, the price of equipment soared. But from now on, better equipment will be sold at a much lower price.\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to cave in to Valhalla to buy Eva\u2019s weapons. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a limit to who can buy and who can\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cSure, there might be cherry pickers like you. But what about the others? Even I\u2019m convinced that this is a sweet deal. Can you be sure there are no more people like me?\u201d", "The man didn\u2019t seem particularly impressed.", "His expression remained flat.", "\u201cThe situation has never been better. Humanity\u2019s been winning against the Parasites for years and now the Federation is with us. More and more people will join the war, seeing that there is hope for victory.\u201d", "\u201cSo you\u2019re saying we should cave in to Valhalla\u2019s demands?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m just saying that we should go along for the ride. You guys do know that the easiest way to earn contribution points is through war, right?\u201d", "The three men nodded in unison.", "\u201cWell, just think about it. There are many more like us stuck at Level 4. What if half of those people join the war, and 10 percent of them become High Rankers?\u201d", "The woman stopped and shifted her gaze from side to side. One of the men, the quick-witted one, stiffened immediately.", "\u201cDo you think even then High Rankers will be treated the way they are now? No, because it\u2019s only natural that demand decreases as supply increases. Currently, Level 5 is considered an ace in any organization, but its value will drop in the future.\u201d", "An upturn in the skills of Earthlings. Not to mention Level 4s, even Level 5s were likely to lose value.", "\u201cThe leaders of most cities are already following Valhalla. Because for them, opening up their cities is much more advantageous whether we like it or not.\u201d", "The woman swallowed hard.", "\u201cScheherazade is still resisting, of course, but who knows what kind of decision Sinyoung will make? And, even if Scheherazade doesn\u2019t change, all that\u2019s waiting for them down the road is destruction.\u201d", "Some fish stay in small rivers while others travel to the sea.", "Those heading to the sea naturally become strong in the face of many adversaries, while those remaining in the river do not change.", "Just like how Valhalla became stronger than Sinyoung.", "\u201cDo you think even then we\u2019ll be able to enjoy Paradise as we do now? I don\u2019t. People are going to look down on us for not participating in the war, and we\u2019ll probably struggle to get a seat in expeditions as well\u2026. We\u2019ll be walking on eggshells the entire time.\u201d", "The two men seemed convinced by the woman\u2019s words.", "The remaining man, who was the first to complain, lowered his head.", "\u201c\u2026I understand what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, he spoke in a slightly softer tone.", "\u201cBut joining the war is a bit\u2026. I was told that the Parasite Queen and the Army Commanders were all gods. How can ordinary humans like us kill gods?\u201d", "The woman smiled as she realized what the man was worried about.", "\u201cI understand. Participating in the war is in itself a risk. But do we really have to take more risks than we can afford?\u201d", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. How can humans beat gods? So we should just avoid them from the start.\u201d", "The man looked at the woman with a dumbfounded look on his face.", "\u201cDo you get what I\u2019m saying? Why should we fight them? There\u2019s an Earthling who\u2019s already killed an Army Commander, and there are plenty of strong people in the Federation.\u201d", "The woman raised her hands and continued.", "\u201cWe should let monsters fight other monsters while we deal with enemies that fit our level. I mean, we can easily beat the lowest-ranked species even now. And if we had more weapons like this? I think we can defeat even stronger ones. And if by any chance, my arrow actually does hit a Medusa\u2026.\u201d", "With the Thunder arrow in her hand, the woman trembled and her eyes sparkled.", "\u201cThese are from the Sky Fairies\u2019 shop, but soon the Dwarves, Cave Fairies, and Beastmen will also open up shops of their own. What do you think?\u201d", "\u201cSo\u2026.\u201d", "The man smacked his lips.", "\u201cWe should move to Eva?\u201d", "\u201cNah. I\u2019m just saying we should go together. I don\u2019t think moving there will be necessary.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cSee, I heard this rumor from a reliable source\u2026.\u201d", "The woman signaled her comrades to gather.", "The three men leaned close to the woman.", "\u201cThe next city to be opened up is likely to be Haramark.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? But isn\u2019t Haramark controlled by Sicilia?\u201d", "\u201cJeez. Don\u2019t you know that the day Valhalla announced its position, the leader of Sicilia flew to Eva immediately to butter up Valhalla?\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "\u201cYou really are oblivious. Do you know they even cut off ties with an ally organization? And Cinzia has already negotiated with Haramark to accept Valhalla\u2019s terms as long as they limit their supervision to criminals.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t believe Sicilia. It was only a few years ago that they started a civil war because they didn\u2019t like the royal family.\u201d", "\u201cThe situation has changed. They\u2019ve been steadily involved in wars since becoming a representative organization. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re glad that Valhalla stepped in this time.\u201d", "The woman lowered her voice further.", "\u201cAnyway, the next city to open will either be Odor or Haramark.

Sinyoung would become one of many mundane organizations out there.", "Just as Valhalla overtook Sinyoung in just two years, this was sure to happen.", "If she did nothing, Sinyoung would fall behind.", "She had to do something before it was too late.", "Something\u2014that would enable Sinyoung to regain its former glory.", "Yun Seohui had never been much of a risk-taker, but right now she had no choice.", "She put her hand on the communication crystal and called her secretary.", "Not long after, a young man, not the HR director, entered her office, stiff with tension.", "\u201cYou called me?\u201d", "\u201cContact\u2026.\u201d", "Yun Seohui bit her lip, exhaled her breath, and started again.", "\u201cContact Valhalla.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d", "Yun Seohui raised her head in a flash.", "She hated repeating herself.", "\u201cI said, contact Valhalla.
