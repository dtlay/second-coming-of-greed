Two fully-naked mounds\u2014 right in front of his eyes.", "As for his nose\u2026.", "Subconsciously smelling the scent of skin, Seol Jihu slowly and sluggishly moved his gaze upwards. And soon, Phi Sora entered his view, her face clearly wrangled with drowsiness and irritation.", "\u201c\u2026There\u2019s something I\u2019m reaaaally dying to know.\u201d", "Perhaps because she was still drunk on sleep, Phi Sora spoke with a hoarse voice.", "\u201cYou look like you\u2019re shocked out of your mind, so why the hell do you keep smelling me for?\u201d", "It was then that Seol Jihu realized that he was taking deeper breaths than necessary. The thought, \u2018Because I like the smell of roses\u2019, crossed his mind for a second.", "\u201cUwaaaaah!\u201d", "Seol Jihu screamed and shot up so hard that he fell backwards.", "\u201cHah!\u201d", "Phi Sora clicked her tongue as she watched Seol Jihu flail his arms and slip away from the bed.", "Thud.

Seol Jihu placed his hand on his chest and took a deep breath.", "Calm down. Calm down.", "After inwardly muttering to himself several times, he spoke up.", "\u201cExplain.\u201d", "He sounded as though he\u2019d been wronged.", "Phi Sora, who was stretching her left arm and covering her yawning mouth with her right hand, looked as if she was struck dumb.", "\u201cExplain what?\u201d", "\u201cFrom the beginning to the end. Everything.\u201d", "\u201cOh, sure. You blacked out in the middle of drinking soju, suddenly started crying, then vomited all over me while I was carrying you.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Come again?\u201d", "\u201cWhat a joke! If you\u2019re weak to alcohol, you should have drunk in moderation. You puked out everything you ate on me, you know? Pork belly, soybean paste stew, rice, naengmyeon\u2026 ugh!\u201d", "Phi Sora shuddered, as if just thinking about it infuriated and disgusted her. Meanwhile, Seol Jihu looked around the room dazedly.", "He could see several clothes neatly hanging on a nearby hanger.", "\u201cI dragged your ass to a motel and cleaned your clothes and hung them up. Shouldn\u2019t you be thanking me? Do you have any idea how many times I wanted to just chuck you down on the ground and leave?\u201d", "As Seol Jihu had no memory of any of this, he was simply dumbstruck by Phi Sora\u2019s recount of the previous evening.", "\u201cStill\u2026 sleeping on the same bed is\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d", "Phi Sora shouted angrily.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you have any conscience?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cYou think I slept on the same bed because I wanted to? I wanted to sleep separately, you know!\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head in confusion as Phi Sora was talking like this wasn\u2019t her fault.", "\u201cI was nice enough to give you the bed, yet you kept climbing down and clinging onto me. So I thought, \u2018Ah, he must like sleeping on the floor\u2019, and switched spots, but then you kept crawling up and clinging onto me there as well. So then I wrapped myself up in the blanket and went to the couch to try to get some sleep, but you even chased me there and clung onto me.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAnd, excuse me, but are you a newborn baby? Why do you keep shoving your face into my breasts? Did you not get any love growing up? Or did you get possessed by some titty-loving ghost? Jesus!!\u201d", "Papapapa! While Phi Sora spat out everything she\u2019d suffered last night, Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "\u201cWell\u2026 I am a middle child, and have an older and a younger sibling\u2026 so I didn\u2019t get as much attention and love growing up\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOoooh, I see\u2026 my bad, I didn\u2019t know that\u2026 NOT! What does that have to do with anything??\u201d", "Phi Sora shot back with fire in her eyes. Seol Jihu let out a dry cough.", "\u201cKuhum, I don\u2019t remember well.\u201d", "\u201cI knew you would say that. Wait right there.\u201d", "Phi Sora quickly took out her phone and threw it over.

After silently pressing the delete button, he slipped the phone to Phi Sora, who was looking down at him with crossed arms.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d", "\u201cWhere the heck did this guy come from!?\u201d", "An angry voice struck Seol Jihu\u2019s ears. He coughed meaninglessly again.", "\u201cAnyways, you\u2019re saying nothing happened?\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s expression turned odd at Seol Jihu\u2019s relieved voice.", "\u201cWhy, you thought I devoured you or something?\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to put it that way\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite. You\u2019re the one who devoured me.\u201d", "\u201cWhat??\u201d", "Seol Jihu jumped in a startle.", "\u201cI mean~ You kept making advances~ You\u2019re fit and pretty good looking, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gotten drunk, so I got a little excited~\u201d", "Phi Sora muttered as she twirled the ends of her hair. Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped.", "\u201cBy the way, dear, your stamina is surprisingly good. You were like a beast. Auu, my stomach still hurts from all the pounding\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora mumbled as she rubbed her lower belly, then burst out laughing when she saw Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "\u201cAah! Your face! Priceless!\u201d", "She giggled, then kicked the blanket off.", "\u201cSee, you react like someone who has a girlfriend.\u201d", "After hopping off the bed, she stretched her arms out, not knowing any shame.", "\u201cAwoooo~ Okay, I\u2019m going to wash up first. Let\u2019s go get some hangover soup.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You were really kidding, right?\u201d", "\u201cWho knows~?\u201d", "After smiling with her eyes, Phi Sora walked into the bathroom, muttering, \u201cAh~ Why is my body so sore~?\u201d", "Chwaaaa\u2014", "Only when the pitter-patter of the shower water rang out did Seol Jihu realize he had been played.", "\u2018That woman\u2026!\u2019", "*", "\u201cUek\u2014\u201d", "While eating dried pollack soup, Phi Sora suddenly cupped her mouth.", "Seol Jihu asked in surprise while in the middle of drinking some soup.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "Phi Sora lowered her hand, then tilted her head.", "\u201cI suddenly feel nauseous\u2026 is it morning sickness?

He was vexed.", "He understood how difficult he made things for Phi Sora last night, but she was having too much fun or perhaps even venting.", "\u2018You dare\u2026\u2019", "You dare to pull a prank on someone whose official nickname is Prankster?", "I\u2019ll show you what a true prank is in a bit\u2014", "Seol Jihu vowed to himself as he finished the dried pollack soup.", "After the meal, Phi Sora stuck her phone out.", "\u201cGive me your number.\u201d", "\u201cMy number?

But Seol Jihu really didn\u2019t remember his number.

Alright, give me a call before you go back. I\u2019ll text you, so you better reply.\u201d", "Phi Sora said what she wanted to, then turned back while waving her hand.

He didn\u2019t feel so bad.", "All he did was bicker with Phi Sora, eat, and wake up, but the unbearable sense of loneliness had almost vanished.", "He felt like his empty chest had been filled with something.", "\u2018Well, now that things turned out like this, should I make some preparations before going back?\u2019", "Seol Jihu turned in a cheerful tune.", "\u2018I have a new friend now too.\u2019", "Although he did not realize this himself, he was even humming joyfully from his nose. His footsteps as he left the alleyway were much lighter than yesterday.", "Seol Jihu looked around his room as soon as he came back. His phone was lying around in the corner.", "After plugging it into the charger and pressing the home button, he was a bit taken aback.

This is Phi Sora.]", "Starting from the most recent message from Phi Sora, he had quite a backlog of unseen messages.", "[Oppa, I heard you woke up. Are you feeling better?]", "[It\u2019s me.

He was shocked at how calm he was, given that he had waited so long for his family to contact him.", "It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t feel sorry or grateful, but he was not trembling from nervousness and fear either. He did not even feel any excitement or hope.", "He just felt\u2026 calm.", "If he had to put this feeling into words, it would be something like, \u2018It\u2019s finally here?\u2019", "He had made great strides compared to the past when he was too afraid to even check his phone and tossed it to the corner of the room.", "\u2018I guess settling the problem of my background is important too.\u2019", "Only now did he have this thought. Seol Jihu stared at the message for a long time before finally clicking the home button again.", "He then found a name from his list of contacts and pressed the call button.

Seol Jihu who was in the middle of eating jajangmyeon[2] shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s open!\u201d, and a ponytailed woman carrying two small boxes stormed into the room.", "Throwing off her high-heels with a kick, she stomped forward and threw a box at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWelco\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Thwack. Seol Jihu drew a blank as the box struck his head.", "\u201cWhy\u2019d you hit me?\u201d", "\u201cMom?\u201d", "Thwack. This time, he was hit by the other box.", "\u201cMom?\u201d", "When he looked up, he saw Kim Hannah looking down at him with a chilly gaze.", "\u201cDo you wanna die? How dare you call a maiden, who hasn\u2019t even married, that.\u201d", "Rubbing his head, Seol Jihu suddenly sniffed. A savory smell wafted out from a greasy box. It had to be fried chicken.", "\u201cWow, you bought me this?\u201d", "Rejoicing, Seol Jihu ignored the box labeled \u2018porridge\u2019 and grabbed the other small box.", "Kim Hannah spat out unhappily.", "\u201c\u2026Why don\u2019t you eat the porridge first?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t wanna.\u201d", "After showing her the empty bowl of jajangmyeon, he shook his head and opened the box of fried chicken.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been having nothing but porridge day in and day out. I\u2019m sick and tired of it now.\u201d", "\u201cCan you at least think about the person who went out of her way to buy it for you and try it out?\u201d", "\u201cNo, just seeing it makes me wanna throw up.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Damn it, then I bought it for nothing.\u201d", "Kim Hannah grumbled briefly before looking around the room and widening her eyes.", "It looked like he ordered from a Chinese restaurant[3], but there was a surprising number of empty bowls stacked on top of each other.", "Two bowls of jajangmyeon, two bowls of jjamppong[4], two bowls of fried rice, one bowl of sweet-and-sour pork\u2026", "Kim Hannah counted the bowls one by one with a frightened look on her face. Seeing Seol Jihu take a bite out of the chicken, she was even more shocked.", "\u201cHey\u2026 did you eat all of this by yourself?\u201d", "\u201cHm? Oh, yeah.\u201d", "\u201cThe hell\u2026 And your stomach can handle it?\u201d", "\u201cMy stomach\u2019s totally fine.\u201d", "Seol Jihu showed off taking a bite out of the chicken, and Kim Hannah gasped.", "\u201cWhat\u2026 but you\u2019re not even the Executor of Gluttony\u2026. This is too strange. That goddess, did she already mark you?\u201d", "\u2018Mark?\u2019", "Unsure what Kim Hannah was talking about, Seol Jihu just continued to nibble on chicken.", "Seeing the young man devote his attention to eating, Kim Hannah sighed and sat down next to him. She was worried that he might have developed some sort of post-war trauma\u2026", "But judging by the way he was munching on the chicken leg, it was hard to think this was the same person who returned alive from that terrifying war.", "\u201cYou look better than I thought.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cI thought you\u2019d be lazing around like a shut-in.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed as he continued eating. What Kim Hannah was describing almost came true, but he had an unexpected change of pace. Because of it, his appetite had returned as well.", "\u201cAh, what about the thing I asked you about?\u201d", "\u201cI brought it, but\u2026.\u201d", "Kim Hannah glanced at her handbag.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cYou said you\u2019d do this on your own. Remember last time? You slammed the door on me after I told you to do something.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I said I\u2019d continue receiving your help.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled bitterly at Seol Jihu\u2019s words. They weren\u2019t quite on the same page. From Kim Hannah\u2019s perspective, Seol Jihu was a hard-to-figure-out person.", "For one, he would shine brilliantly in Paradise but suddenly become weird when he returned to Earth. He was especially clueless when it came to his relationship with his family. She had seen him dig a hole for himself on more than one occasion.", "That was why she told him she would take care of his family relationship as his guardian, but Seol Jihu had suddenly requested to cancel this arrangement.", "He said he would take care of it on his own, and that she only needed to provide him the necessary information.", "Kim Hannah was half in doubt when she heard him request the information calmly, but now\u2026", "\u2018He changed again.\u2019", "She felt like he changed a bit when the Banquet ended, but after the war this time, the change was clearer.", "If there were two Seol Jihus, one in Paradise and one on Earth, it was almost as if the Seol Jihu in Paradise was overwriting the Seol Jihu on Earth.", "She wasn\u2019t sure whether this was a good thing or a bad thing\u2026 but if his talent as Paradise\u2019s problem-solver could be carried over to Earth, then she had a strong feeling that a way out would be found in his troubling family relationship.", "1. I have no clue what this goalkeeper thing is. Maybe it\u2019s a reference to some well-known spam. ", "2. Black bean sauce noodles. ", "3. Not actual Chinese food.
