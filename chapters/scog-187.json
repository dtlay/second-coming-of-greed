She then heaved out a long sigh before nodding her head.", "\u201cAlright, go ahead.\u201d", "She agreed, much to Seol Jihu\u2019s surprise.", "How should he start? It was a fairly sensitive topic, so Seol Jihu had some hesitations. In the end, he decided to reaffirm her future plans first.", "Her thoughts might have changed since the last time they talked. After all, some pretty significant incidents had taken place since then, and it had also been a while back since they had their talk. If this were the case, there was a chance Seol Jihu was worrying about nothing.", "He asked blatantly.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThe reason that you\u2019re staying with Carpe Diem.\u201d", "Phi Sora retorted with a glum look.", "\u201cEven though I never spelled it out, I thought I showed you more than a few times through my actions.\u201d", "This likely meant her plans had not changed.", "\u201cI just can\u2019t understand why. Someone like you should easily be able to enter a bigger organization than Carpe Diem.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d", "Phi Sora agreed without sounding arrogant in any way.", "\u201cBut it will be hard to find a place with the same atmosphere as Carpe Diem. And to be honest, I think Carpe Diem is a good match for me.\u201d", "\u201cGood match?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not my style to enter an already established team and put my spoon in the utensil box. Dear, did you know that I entered Paradise as a Red Mark?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head, remembering seeing this info in her Status Window.", "\u201cYou know how men are like, right? They always go on about how hard it was for them being in the army, but they also say it wasn\u2019t so bad. I kind of understand what they mean. It was really hard when I first entered Paradise. Working like a dog, being scorned at like a slave\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora smirked before putting her pinky in her glass and swirling it around.", "\u201cI risked my life countless times and, in the end, I got everyone to shut up with my skills alone. That was surprisingly fun.\u201d", "The word fun got on Seol Jihu\u2019s nerves slightly, but he didn\u2019t really pick a problem with it. After all, in a gaming environment there were people who enjoyed the process of reaching the max level rather than starting out at the max level and sweeping through everything.", "That was probably what she meant.", "\u201cAnd in a way, I think I grabbed the perfect time to join the team.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? With you around, Carpe Diem\u2019s potential for growth is infinite. There\u2019s a chance it will become a massive organization that people wouldn\u2019t be able to get in even if they wanted to.\u201d", "Phi Sora took her pinky out and sucked on it.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think about this, but I think I can offer a lot to the current Carpe Diem. And if I play a pivotal role in a team that\u2019s just now starting out, I might be treated as a founding contributor in the future.\u201d", "\u201cFounding contributor?\u201d", "\u201cYep. Unless I\u2019m mistaken in my judgment of your character, you wouldn\u2019t mistreat me when you eventually become the head of an organization that acts as one of the pillars of Paradise.\u201d", "Phi Sora smiled as if just thinking about this made her happy.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her honest confession.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it too early to be dreaming of a rosy future?\u201d", "\u201cOne can dream. I\u2019m confident.\u201d", "Well, her confidence was justified, given that she was the core member who grew the White Rose guild.", "Taking Phi Sora\u2019s skills into account, Seol Jihu should be welcoming her with open arms. But there were a few things that stopped him from happily grabbing her hand.", "To be frank, Phi Sora, in Seol Jihu\u2019s opinion, was an Earthling who was more suited to being a leader than an officer.", "\u201cCan\u2019t you just form your own team, Miss Phi Sora? With your experience, you have more competent\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "But before he could even finish his sentence, Phi Sora waved her hand and denied it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I hate compliments, but I think you\u2019re overestimating me. I know me. I\u2019m not fit to be a leader.\u201d", "She shook her head and continued.", "\u201cMoreover, I won\u2019t be leading anyone in that place ever again. Why? Because I don\u2019t want to. Ever.\u201d", "She reaffirmed her decision, emphasizing her point and even repeating the word ever twice.", "While Seol Jihu was taken aback by her unexpectedly intense denial, a hint of sorrow flit past Phi Sora\u2019s face.", "Although it only lasted a split second, Seol Jihu did not miss this show of emotion and finally guessed what she was really feeling.", "\u2018A trauma.\u2019", "Because of a single wrong choice, she had indirectly caused the deaths of the comrades she had shared joys and sorrows with. This must have changed her outlook somehow.", "Seol Jihu had mixed feelings, but he soon shook them off by shaking his head.", "He wanted to draw a strict line between his public and private life.", "Though it was hard to say he was making a good effort at that, he decided to tell Phi Sora the truth as well.", "\u201cI know you told me not to talk about this topic, but let me say this. Thank you so much for participating in the war. I\u2019m sincerely grateful.\u201d", "\u201cThank you for saying that. I was worried you\u2019d make fun of me since I was knocked out in one blow after boasting so much.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head. That was the furthest thing from his mind.", "The appearance of the Seven Armies was something no one had expected, and an Army Commander wasn\u2019t any ordinary being.", "Seol Jihu had also heard that Phi Sora refused to rat him out until the very end, even though Undying Diligence promised not to kill her if she complied.", "In other words, she had been loyal as a comrade. Just like the saying, someone\u2019s true nature can only be seen in extreme situations, Seol Jihu now saw Phi Sora in a different light.", "At the very least, she was a thousand times better than the bastard who shot his hand up and shouted to try and reveal his identity.", "\u201cYou ignored me at the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain too. Looks like it was worth risking my life.\u201d", "\u2026Well, her temper seemed to be the same though.", "Seol Jihu clicked his tongue inwardly, then spoke up.", "\u201cThe reason I wasn\u2019t pleased with you then was due to Seol-Ah and Sungjin. As you can guess, the two of them don\u2019t feel comfortable around you. They even fear you to a certain extent. I\u2019m sure you know why.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I do.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, considering Bok Jungsik and Miss Phi Sora\u2019s relationship, I understand why you acted like that at the time. But only the reason, and nothing more.\u201d", "At that moment, the shrugging Phi Sora\u2019s eyebrows twitched slightly.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is that this past political relationship can no longer affect the siblings. Because Carpe Diem doesn\u2019t have factions.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d love it if Miss Phi Sora can get along with the Yi siblings, but\u2026 I know that isn\u2019t something I can enforce. But I\u2019m hoping the relationship will improve so that it won\u2019t affect our future missions\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu examined Phi Sora\u2019s facial expression as he talked. Up until this point, her face was a little stiff, but he didn\u2019t catch any glaring changes.", "It was a rather positive reaction given her nickname, so Seol Jihu slowly continued what he was saying.", "\u201cSince we\u2019re talking about this\u2026.\u201d", "He poured soju into his empty glass and continued.", "\u201cWhat do you think about apologizing to them? In my opinion, Seol-Ah and Sungjin will accept your apology if you\u2019re sincere about atoning for your actions.\u201d", "Because he was preoccupied with something else, he couldn\u2019t see Phi Sora\u2019s eyes twisting into a frown momentarily.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about it, I can help too. They\u2019re kind, so once I talk to them, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d", "Tak! The clang of a utensil being slammed down rang out.", "Seol Jihu, who was in the middle of tilting his glass of soju, looked up with blinking eyes.", "Phi Sora was staring at him with an enraged expression.", "\u201cMiss Phi Sora?\u201d", "\u201cI just don\u2019t understand it\u2014\u201d", "She complained immediately.", "\u201cI mean, don\u2019t fight, don\u2019t argue, don\u2019t purposely make them uncomfortable. I would have accepted those, but what? Apologize? Atone?\u201d", "She suddenly began to bitch. Seol Jihu stared at Phi Sora with a dumbfounded look.", "\u201cFine, I\u2019m the sinner. I committed a grave sin.\u201d", "Seol Jihu narrowed his eyes.", "\u201c\u2026What did you say?\u201d", "His tone got a notch deeper.", "\u201cI said I committed a grave sin!\u201d", "When Phi Sora yelled sharply, several gazes fell on her. Seol Jihu\u2019s mood sank.", "\u201cYou\u2019re talking like you don\u2019t think you did anything wrong.\u201d", "\u201cNo? When did I say that? All I\u2019m asking is why I should be the one walking on eggshells!\u201d", "\u201cFunny. If you don\u2019t like walking on eggshells, why did you make the Yi siblings do the same thing?\u201d", "\u201cBecause they deserved it!\u201d", "Phi Sora shot her eyes open and shouted defiantly.", "\u201cMiss Phi Sora.\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows.", "\u201cDo you not want to talk to me?\u201d", "\u201cYou call this talking? It\u2019s a one-sided command!\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI was going to hold it in, but I just can\u2019t bear to hear it anymore.\u201d", "Pew! Phi Sora spat out a sigh before starting her engine.", "\u201cThose kids, they should be thankful all they had to do was walk on eggshells. Well, since you\u2019re on their side, I\u2019m sure you want to go \u2018ooh~ my babies~\u2019. But will you be able to act the same way if they\u2019re complete strangers? I mean, have you ever thought about the matter from my perspective?\u201d", "The reason Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t saying anything back\u2026", "[You\u2019re praising her unceasingly. But can you say the same if you hadn\u2019t known her?]", "\u2026was because of what Jang Maldong had said to him in the past.", "\u201cYou said you understand why I acted that way? No, not at all. You don\u2019t know a thing.\u201d", "Seol Jihu reined in his own temper and crossed his arms.", "\u201cThen what\u2019s the reason?\u201d", "\u201cReasonsss. There are too many to count.\u201d", "Phi Sora took a short breath, crossed her arms just like Seol Jihu, then tilted her chin up arrogantly.", "\u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t like the fact that they were brought in by that Bok bastard.\u201d", "\u201cThe girl could have come alone, but she insisted on bringing her younger brother along and made us use twice the necessary amount of contribution points.\u201d", "\u201cAnd, becoming a Level 2 in just three months? Aigooo~ With how much Bok Jungsik invested in her as White Rose\u2019s future, only a retard wouldn\u2019t reach Level 2 within that time.\u201d"]}
