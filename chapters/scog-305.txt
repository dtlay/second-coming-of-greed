Guidance (2)", "content": ["The Saintes Mesures of Sidus guided Seol Jihu to the prison within the Eva Royal Palace.", "He didn\u2019t know why it made him come here, but he decided to go in regardless.", "When he opened the door and entered, he came face to face with a man, who seemingly was the prison warden. He stared at Seol Jihu fixedly for two good seconds before shooting up from his chair.", "\u201cAigo! What\u2019s Valhalla Representative doing in a humble place like this\u2026\u201d", "While Seol Jihu was wondering how to respond, the man continued right away.", "\u201cAh, did you come together?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d", "\u201cThe earlier visitor went in a while ago. I can guide you inside if you\u2019d like.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head without thinking. The warden must have misunderstood, but it also sounded like there was someone who came to the prison before him. Someone who was close enough to him for the warden to know.", "\u201cThis way, please.\u201d", "Seol Jihu followed after the warden, who was taking his keys off his waist, all the while wondering just who it could be.", "The inside of the prison was surprisingly decent. Seol Jihu was expecting to see dark and damp cells, but the place was actually quite habitable.", "But as they went down to the first floor and then the second floor, the scenery changed completely. Everything beyond a meter was shrouded in total darkness.", "The air was damp and unpleasant, and the walls were covered in moss and looked wet from moisture. Although Seol Jihu had no problem seeing, thanks to eating the Golden Wind Phoenix, ordinary people would have to rely on a torchlight to cross this darkness.", "\u201cKind of eerie, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "The warden laughed as he walked ahead.", "\u201cThe guards try to avoid going down to the second floor. It kind of feels like something\u2019s going to jump out at you, huh.\u201d", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cHaha, sometimes I feel bad for the prisoners who are in solitary confinement on this floor.\u201d", "Right, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for anyone to go crazy if they were locked up in this dark and isolated place for long.", "Seol Jihu asked while nodding his head.", "\u201cIs the second floor like a special prison?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Where a prisoner ends up depends on their sentence. The ones who will get out soon stay on the ground level, and the ones who committed a comparatively heavy crime get locked up on the first floor. To be honest, it\u2019s quite hard to get sent down to the second floor.\u201d", "The man cleared his throat before continuing.", "\u201cThe criminals who end up here are people who committed unforgivable crimes against Paradisians and Earthlings, or those who should not be set free in the outside world. They\u2019re generally well-known criminals who end up on the Red Notice.\u201d", "\u201cIt must be pretty hard to get out then once you\u2019re here.\u201d", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s impossible. You can get out if you\u2019re dead. You\u2019ll just be a spirit then.\u201d", "Seol Jihu chuckled at the warden\u2019s joke.", "\u201cAh, there she is.\u201d", "They finally arrived at their destination. Following the warden\u2019s finger, Seol Jihu saw a familiar back. Though the hallway was a little dark, Seol Jihu could tell who it was just by seeing her ponytail and office attire.", "\u2018Why is Kim Hannah here?\u2019", "A question arose in Seol Jihu\u2019s mind, but he halted his steps.", "\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d", "\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll leave the door open until you come up.\u201d", "The warden nodded courteously before turning around and walking away. Seol Jihu stealthily walked over to the other side.", "Kim Hannah looked a little strange. She was standing in front of a tightly shut prison door without moving an inch. She must be in deep focus as she didn\u2019t notice Seol Jihu walking up behind her.", "After weighing his options\u2026", "\u201cYo!\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke loudly as he poked Kim Hannah\u2019s back.", "Surprisingly, Kim Hannah didn\u2019t yell or scream. But judging by how she went stiff and hissed out a gasp, she was definitely startled.", "Seol Jihu asked while being disappointed by her reaction.", "\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s head creaked back, clearly lost for words. Perhaps because daylight didn\u2019t enter this place, her face looked pale.", "\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah shook in a mixture of surprise and anger before finally heaving out a sigh.", "\u201cEhew. I almost died from a heart attack. I should be asking you that question. What brings you here?\u201d", "\u201cI have something to do.\u201d", "\u201cSomething to do?\u201d", "\u201cYep. What about you? What were you doing?\u201d", "Saying so, Seol Jihu walked closer to the rusted iron door.", "\u201cHey, hey.\u201d", "Kim Hannah tried to stop him, but Seol Jihu was already peeking inside the cell through the rectangular hole used for serving food.", "\u201c\u2026Euk.\u201d", "He furrowed his brows immediately afterward. The first reason was that a foul stench mixed with all kinds of odors wafted out. The second reason was that he could only see black and red colors.", "At that moment, the reddish-black color blinked. Realizing that it came from a bloodshot eye, Seol Jihu stepped back in a fright.", "\u201cSave me!\u201d", "The door shouted. No, a voice was heard from inside.", "\u201cSave me. Save me! Please let me out! I was wrong. Please, please\u2026\u201d", "A desperate voice mixed with sobbing rang out. As Seol Jihu stared at the door in a daze\u2026", "\u201cAh, jeez\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah pressed her forehead with a hint of frustration. Her reaction was like someone whose embarrassing secret was revealed.", "After a moment of silence, Kim Hannah grumbled.", "\u201c\u2026I was enjoying my hobby.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t say anything. I definitely told you about it and even got permission.\u201d", "\u201cPermission?\u201d", "\u201cJung Sua, I mean.\u201d", "[That Jung Sua. Can you let me deal with her?]", "[I\u2019m going to make her shit blood.]", "\u2018Ah.\u2019", "Seol Jihu finally realized why Kim Hannah was here, what she was doing, and just who was imprisoned in this cell.", "It was the previous representative of Evangeline\u2014 Jung Sua.", "Seol Jihu knew she was in prison. He just didn\u2019t know she was on the second basement level. Calming down, he looked at the door once again.", "\u201cSave me\u2026 Please let me out\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "To be honest, she didn\u2019t really look like Jung Sua. It might be because he could only see a small part of her, but the way she clung to the door and mumbled endlessly, a screw seemed to have gone loose in her head.", "\u201cWow, just how much did you torture her?\u201d", "\u201cI never tortured her.\u201d", "Kim Hannah replied in a deadpan voice.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t lay a single finger on her. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d", "She paused and hesitated for a long time before spitting out the truth helplessly.", "\u201cI changed the condition of her cell a little.\u201d", "\u201cCondition of her cell?\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked past the bawling Jung Sua and studied the cell. He immediately became lost for words.", "He was wondering why it smelled so bad. The floor of the cell was wet with wastewater, and all kinds of filth and trash were floating in the pool.", "He couldn\u2019t see anything other than that. Not even a bed.", "\u2018So this is where all that foul stench is coming from\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s stomach churned just by imagining eating and sleeping in such an enclosed filthy cell.", "\u201cAnyway, why are you here? Do you have business with her?\u201d", "Seol Jihu snapped out his daze at Kim Hannah\u2019s question. Why did the Saintes Mesures of Sidus guide him to Jung Sua? What did she know?", "\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say\u2026 I won\u2019t enter Paradise ever again\u2026 That\u2019s right! You can just kill me!\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared at the blabbering Jung Sua. To be honest, he didn\u2019t really expect her to know something. Even though she was the representative of an organization, as an Earthling, she was nothing more than an ordinary opportunist.", "But it was then.", "\u2018Wait.\u2019", "The name of a woman suddenly crossed his mind. Evangeline Rose, the original founder and representative of the now-disbanded organization.", "Jung Sua pursued only her own advancement of status, but Evangeline Rose was different. Though the effectiveness of her methods was debatable, Seol Jihu had heard on multiple occasions that she was an Earthling who truly worked for the interest of Paradise.", "In that case, the story was different. After Evangeline Rose\u2019s death, Jung Sua successfully took over the empty representative position. This meant that Jung Sua had a fairly large authority within the Evangeline organization before Evangeline Rose\u2019s death.", "There was no way a bottom-rung member would be smoothly promoted to the highest position, even if Charlotte Aria supported her. It was likely that Jung Sua had at least a team leader\u2019s position.", "In other words, Jung Sua must have watched Evangeline Rose from a close distance.", "\u2018The Guardian of Eva, huh\u2026\u2019", "Looking back, it wasn\u2019t just once or twice that this happened. Whether he liked it or not, after he moved to Eva, what Seol Jihu was trying to do was invariably intertwined with what Evangeline Rose tried to do, like when he busted the Eva Alliance or when he recruited Eun Yuri.", "So there was at least a little chance that this matter was related to Evangeline Rose as well.", "In that case, there must have been something she was working on, even if it was only a little bit.", "Seol Jihu spoke, recalling the question he raised a long time ago.", "\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes!\u201d", "Jung Sua nodded her head crazily. She looked ready to answer anything.", "\u201cI\u2019ll be straightforward. Do you know why Evangeline Rose participated in the Banquet?\u201d", "\u201cThe Banquet\u2026?\u201d", "Jung Sua\u2019s face contorted pitifully.", "\u201cI-I have no clue. I don\u2019t think anyone knows why. Evangeline Rose always acted on her own\u2026.\u201d", "She wasn\u2019t wrong about that.", "[Unni\u2019s personality was like that. She didn\u2019t trust others easily and always tried to do things alone.]", "Evangeline Rose\u2019s younger sister described her as a lone hero as well.", "[She was indeed an outstanding person. But to tell you the truth, I did not like her that much.]", "[Evangeline Rose was an Earthling who had principles and also the ability to achieve her goals.]", "[But she\u2026 how should I say this\u2026]", "[She did not have any expectations. Rather than leaving it to you guys, I\u2019d rather take care of it myself. She was always like that.]", "Sorg K\u00fchne said something similar too.", "So, Seol Jihu decided to broaden the range a little more.", "\u201cTell me if you have a suspicion or a guess. Even if it\u2019s not about why she participated in the Banquet, it\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s related.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know anything\u2026 Anything related, anything related\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu could feel the anxiousness in her voice. Jung Sua scowled. She was murmuring repeatedly while racking her brain. It seemed she really wanted to escape this place.", "But no matter how long Seol Jihu waited, the clue he wanted did not appear. It didn\u2019t look like Jung Sua was hiding anything either.", "\u2018\u2026Maybe I guessed wrong.\u2019", "Just as the disappointed Seol Jihu turned around and thought about looking for other clues, Jung Sua\u2019s eyes suddenly shot open.", "\u201cT-The Magician!\u201d", "She shouted as if to grab onto a lifeline that was disappearing.", "Seol Jihu paused.", "\u201cMagician?\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes! The Magician! Adam Galaev! That person tried to stop Evangeline Rose from participating in the Banquet!\u201d", "\u201cAdam Galaev\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah, who was quietly watching until now, chimed in.", "\u201cHe worked inside the Evangeline organization in the past. He was more like an honorary member than an official one.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of him?\u201d", "\u201cYeah. But one day, he left Evangeline for an unknown reason. This was long before the last Banquet opened, so it doesn\u2019t really make sense time-wise\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu glanced at Jung Sua, who was still clinging onto the door.", "\u201cNo, not at all!\u201d", "Jung Sua hurriedly shouted.", "\u201cIt\u2019s true that he and Evangeline Rose went separate ways, but they didn\u2019t break off completely! They continued to exchange letters afterward! Evangeline Rose might not have replied, but I know she received them! I saw them with my own eyes!\u201d", "\u201cHmm. What did the letters say?\u201d", "\u201cI-I don\u2019t remember well\u2026 Something about the Banquet being ineffective\u2026 That they should join hands\u2026 He was basically saying that his method was correct, but I\u2019m not sure exactly what he meant\u2026\u201d", "Jung Sua stammered with doubt, but Seol Jihu\u2019s ears perked up.", "\u2018Method.\u2019", "[Well, I really can\u2019t blame her given the state of the government affairs back then, but I think it was wrong of her to part ways with the one and only Magician just because she did not agree with that person.]", "Come to think of it, Sorg K\u00fchne had said something like that as well.", "Seol Jihu finally found a lead. Of course, he would need to dig deeper into it to be certain.", "\u201cLetters\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes. You said anything is fine, right?\u201d", "Jung Sua looked relieved once Seol Jihu showed signs of being interested. She let loose a long sigh and regained her composure slightly.", "\u201cCan you tell me more? About the letters, I mean.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 mmm\u2026.\u201d", "Jung Sua pretended to be in conflict before speaking in a furtive voice.", "\u201cIf you can let me out\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face changed colors.", "\u201cI-I mean! I don\u2019t really remember well! So if I go out\u2014\u201d", "Jung Sua continued in a fluster, but Seol Jihu turned away. He didn\u2019t have the energy to deal with Jung Sua\u2019s hard-to-get play. Since there was an expert on the scene, entrusting the matter to her and backing off seemed best.", "\u201cKim Hannah.\u201d", "Perhaps judging that this was no longer a private place, Kim Hannah fixed her posture.", "\u201cYou heard everything I said just now, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes, Representative.\u201d", "\u201cEven the tiniest detail is important. Dig out everything she knows about Evangeline Rose.\u201d", "Jung Sua\u2019s complexion distorted miserably.", "\u201cYou can do it, right?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. But\u2014\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m about to leave.\u201d", "Hearing this, Kim Hannah shut her mouth. It seemed she didn\u2019t want others to see her enjoying her hobby.", "Seol Jihu turned back.", "\u201cWait! Wait! I\u2019ll tell you! Please don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t leave me alone with this person!!\u201d", "Jung Sua belatedly shouted, but Seol Jihu left without hesitation.", "*", "It was late at night when Kim Hannah returned. Seol Jihu expected her to take a few days, so she came back earlier than he expected.", "She said she could have come back even earlier but got delayed to investigate something.", "\u201cThese are Evangeline Rose\u2019s personal items. Jung Sua\u2019s infatuation with role-playing came in handy.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke as she placed down a bag on the table.", "Seol Jihu gave it a glance.", "\u201cRole-playing?\u201d", "\u201cYes, she must have thought she needed to know Evangeline Rose well if she were to play out her role. That\u2019s why she was keeping all of her personal items under the pretext of transfer of duties.\u201d", "\u201cKeeping them where?\u201d", "\u201cIn the temple storage. Ah, she also had some hidden assets, so I retrieved them to add to Valhalla\u2019s company fund.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled sweetly, saying that she took everything from Jung Sua\u2019s temple storage in exchange for letting her out.", "Seol Jihu marveled. He ordered her to dig every last detail out of her, and Kim Hannah did exactly that.", "\u201cWhere\u2019s Jung Sua?\u201d", "\u201cI sent her off properly. That was the promise. Well, what happens to her on Earth is none of my business.\u201d", "Kim Hannah made a suggestive comment before rummaging through the bag. Was Seol Jihu mistaken in thinking that she \u2018sent her off properly\u2019 to the afterlife rather than home?", "\u201cFirst, these are the clothes and underwear that Evangeline Rose wore while she was alive. Her jackets are here too.\u201d", "Kim Hannah said as she took out several clothes.", "\u201cDon\u2019t joke now.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not joking. You said grab anything and everything, right? For the record, a capable Archer can discover many clues just from what someone wears.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d", "After thinking about it for a moment, Seol Jihu nodded his head, thinking that it made sense.", "\u201cCall Ayase Kazuki over. An Archer of his caliber should be able to tell us something. And also\u2014\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked askance after saying calmly.", "\u201cI thought somebody would like it.\u201d", "\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a pervert? I don\u2019t enjoy any random girl\u2019s clothes, you know.\u201d", "Kim Hannah stared fixedly at the protesting Seol Jihu. Though she had many things she wanted to say, she shook her head.", "\u201cAnyway, there are all kinds of items here\u2026 but you should probably look at this first.\u201d", "Kim Hannah placed her hand on the table. Three neatly folded papers were sitting on it.", "\u201cThese are the letters Jung Sua talked about.\u201d", "The letters Adam Galaev sent Evangeline Rose.", "Right, these were what Seol Jihu wanted. Scanning them briefly, he noticed they were quite long.", "Seol Jihu quickly started reading.", "\u2014To my beloved Evangeline Rose,\u00a0I\u2019ve thought about a lot before picking up my pen.

Galaev", "\u2014I received your letter well. I understand that you will not change your mind about participating in the Banquet. I also understand that you do not trust my plan.

In a way, it seems we are both the same.", "", "What I want to tell you is that you need to trust others more, especially those who share your values and wish for your well-being.There is a limit to how far you can go on your own.

Galaev", "\u2014Beloved Evangeline Rose, I apologize for the late reply. I must admit, reading that you will no longer reply has made me sad.

That things have been working out in strange ways recently. That we need to act in haste.", "I do not know how Haramark\u2019s recent valley war affected you mentally.
