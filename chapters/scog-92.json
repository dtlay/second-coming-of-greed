{"cid": "92", "title": "Chapter 92. Addiction", "content": ["One could say that an organization was a societal group in which people gathered under the banner of achieving a common goal. Members of an organization understood each other through frequent interactions and gave their effort in accomplishing a shared goal. Such organizations prioritized profit the most, and given the unique nature of Paradise, different groups were called different things.", "One thing to note was that a group\u2019s name did not reflect its power in any way. Usually, the number of organization members determined its title. Small-scale or independent organizations were called teams, groups, crews, societies, or associations, while mid and large-scale organizations were called alliances, guilds, unions, or companies.", "Put this way, Paradise\u2019s temple was also an organization. The Temple of Luxuria was an organization of Priests who served the goddess of lust. Described in more detail, this organization once held the biggest influence in all of Paradise.", "Of course, this was all a glory of the past. That was when both Seo Yuhui and Sung Shihyun were active. To be precise, the Temple of Luxuria was at the height of its glory before these two Executors split up after a falling out.", "Sung Shihyun left for Sinyoung after this incident, and Seo Yuhui announced her retirement from Paradise. Naturally, the Temple of Luxuria\u2019s influence plummeted. But just like the saying, \u2018an old eagle is better than a young crow\u2019, the Temple of Luxuria still could not be looked down upon. Given its nature as a temple, there was no need to worry it would fail either.", "It was just that its current influence was lacking compared to when it was led by two Executors. Naturally, Priests who could not forget the past glory constantly sought out to revitalize the group.", "For example, today. A Level 6 Bishop wearing a miter visited Haramark\u2019s Temple of Luxuria for this exact reason.", "\u201cPlease help.\u201d", "He knelt on the ground. He knew very well that the person he was talking to would feel bothered by his actions. The Bishop\u2019s status wasn\u2019t so low as to kneel so frivolously, and he definitely wasn\u2019t the type to enjoy such indignant actions. In fact, he was someone who liked to flaunt his authority. However, the woman in front of him was more than worthy enough for him to endure minor humiliations such as this.", "\u201cThe Order\u2019s caste system is breaking down. Please return to guide us, Executor.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "A gentle voice cut him off.", "\u201cI will not return to the Order of Luxuria.\u201d", "She sounded firm as if there was no room for negotiations. However, the miter-wearing man didn\u2019t back down.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you promise? That you would return if we make an expedition to the Delphinion Duchy\u2019s laboratory.\u201d", "\u201cI certainly did.\u201d", "The woman retorted clearly.", "\u201cBut the expedition is no longer needed. The laboratory has been destroyed completely, and all members of the rescue team returned alive. The Order never set out on the expedition, yet you\u2019re asking me to keep my side of the promise?\u201d", "Her logical response put the man at a loss of words. The woman was well-known for keeping every promise she made. As someone who had watched her for a long time, the Bishop knew that better than anyone else. He had prodded her just to be sure, only to end up being put into his place.", "\u201cMiss Seo Yuhui, you may have resigned from your position as an Executor, but you know that Goddess Luxuria has not allowed it.\u201d", "\u201cYou are mistaken. She allowed me.\u201d", "\u201cBut don\u2019t you still possess the Apostle\u2019s Authorities? I\u2019m sure you know what that means.\u201d", "\u201cI made my intentions clear. You are better off asking her personally if you are curious why she has not taken the Authorities away.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Please, our Order and Lord Luxuria are both rejoicing at the news of your return.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re an Earthling, I\u2019m sure you know about how contracts are made within Paradise. I am also just another Earthling.\u201d", "Hearing Seo Yuhui\u2019s unyielding position on the matter, the Bishop stared at the floor and bit his lower lips. It had been a long time since he experienced her iciness. Seo Yuhui was known as the Ice Queen within Paradise precisely because no man had ever succeeded in wooing her, including the famous Sung Shihyun.", "But having served by Seo Yuhui\u2019s side for a long time, the Bishop knew that wasn\u2019t all there was to it. Although Seo Yuhui was benevolent and generous, she never approached someone beyond what was necessary and didn\u2019t allow anyone to approach her beyond what was necessary.", "This didn\u2019t apply to only her romantic life but all facets of it. A man lured in by her outer magnanimity would surely run into her iciness one day. Although most knew they stood little chance, they remained hopeful that they might just melt her heart.", "\u201cWe have long fallen out of our relationship with the Temple of Gula. Now that you are no longer with us, the number of deserters is increasing by the day.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper to call them \u2018deserters\u2019. Besides, I was never happy with the way the Order exerted influence on other organizations by using the Priests\u2019 rare healing capabilities and its unique status as a temple.\u201d", "\u201cB-But you must know why that was necessary. Even now, outside organizations are trying to steal our Priests away with sweet talk. Some are even using them to interfere in our internal affairs.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui didn\u2019t say anything in response. The temperature of the room suddenly plummeted. The Bishop must have been pressured by Seo Yuhui\u2019s cold gaze as he dropped his head until his miter almost touched the ground.", "After staying silent for a long time, Seo Yuhui finally opened her mouth.", "\u201cThat\u2019s quite a problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "Flinch. The man trembled. His heart skipped a beat. Could it be?", "\u201cBut that has nothing to do with me.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui quickly put down any hopeful thoughts in the Bishop\u2019s head.", "\u201cI have already left the Order. In a way, I guess I am also an outsider.\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cSo it is none of my business what the Temple of Luxuria is up to or how it is faring.\u201d", "\u201cAre you\u2026 are you truly saying you will abandon the Order and remain a bystander?\u201d", "\u201cYes, and one more thing.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui replied without a moment of hesitation.", "\u201cWhat we talked about today? You can make it public.\u201d", "Her words caused the Bishop to blink his eyes in shock.", "\u201cI\u2019ll repeat one more time. What we talked about today, you can use it however you want. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201d", "The Bishop was about to raise his head and ask but froze stiff on the spot.", "\u2018What?\u2019", "Cold sweat flowed down his back. The woman who was modestly sitting on the couch was now in front of him. Seo Yuhui leisurely reached out her arm, took off the Bishop\u2019s miter, and carefully brought it to her eyes.", "\u201cSo.\u201d", "She studied the shining jewel decorating the center of the miter.", "\u201cPlease, don\u2019t bother me any more than this, Miss Yun Seohui.\u201d", "She gave a refreshing smile. Pzzt! The jewel\u2019s light flickered off. This meant one of two things - the other side had either severed the connection or destroyed the crystal. Of course, both Seo Yuhui and the Bishop knew it was the latter.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, the Bishop revealed his teeth.", "\u201c\u2026You knew.\u201d", "\u201cI noticed that you changed the miter\u2019s jewel. I know you aren\u2019t the type to change something like that so easily.\u201d", "\u201cHoh, with just that?\u201d", "\u201cWhether it be liquor, clothes, or friends, you always say you prefer old ones.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui placed the miter back on the Bishop\u2019s head before returning to her couch. She then continued.", "\u201cGo back.\u201d", "With just those two words, the Bishop knew that the thin thread of connection they still shared was cut off. He had nothing to say and could only stand up helplessly.", "\u201cDo you not blame me?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, after all.\u201d", "\u201cI see.\u201d", "\u201cRather than being devoured bit by bit, it might indeed be better to join hands with Sinyoung.\u201d", "\u2018So she knew everything.\u2019 The Bishop let out a bitter chuckle.", "\u201cI know I am in no position to say this, but please, I would be eternally grateful if you came back.\u201d", "\u201cMy answer is the same no matter how many times you ask me.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui never lost her gentle smile from the beginning to end of this conversation. In the end, the Bishop sighed dejectedly and turned around to leave. It was then.", "Click.", "The door clicked open. The Bishop looked up reflexively and saw a young man trudging into the room.", "\u2018Hm?\u2019", "His face was full of drowsiness. His eyes were barely open, and judging from the way he looked around in a daze, it seemed the young man had woken up only a moment ago. The young man was walking half-asleep, but he didn\u2019t look like he was sleeping walking.", "After appearing out of the blue and looking around the room, the young man\u2019s gaze suddenly landed in one place.", "\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d", "The Bishop asked belatedly, but his word immediately came to a stop. Tap, tap, tap, tap. Like a baby with some sort of a sensor on his hands, the young man quickly crawled to his target. Once he reached the couch, he buried his face in Seo Yuhui\u2019s laps.", "\u201cOh?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui, who had been watching the young man in a daze, muttered out in surprise.", "\u2018What?\u2019", "The Bishop was even more shocked. He had never seen Seo Yuhui allow someone to approach her so easily. Not even once.", "\u201cGeez\u2026 again?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui made a troubled expression, then\u2026.", "\u201cI told you to sleep quietly\u2026 ehew.\u201d", "She clicked her tongue and gently stroked the young man\u2019s hair. She seemed to be at a loss for what to do, yet she was clearly patting him willingly. Seeing the young man rub his cheek on her thighs with a happy smile, the Bishop was shocked once again. Not only did Seo Yuhui allow him to approach her, but she even let him touch her?!", "\u2018Im, impossible!\u2019", "He almost wanted to scream out, \u2018That\u2019s blasphemy!\u2019 He began to doubt whether the woman in front of him was the Ice Queen he knew.", "\u201cAh, this is my fault.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui must have seen the Bishop\u2019s culture-shocked face as she heaved out a deep sigh.", "\u201cI-It\u2019s Miss Seo Yuhui\u2019s fault?\u201d", "\u201cYes, I spoiled him a bit too much and he developed a habit\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui mumbled in embarrassment.", "\u201cExcuse us.\u201d", "She got up from the couch as if the situation couldn\u2019t be helped.", "\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back to your room. Hurry.\u201d", "Drag, drag. The young man was dragged out of the room, his arms still interlinked around Seo Yuhui\u2019s waist as he made his exit.", "The Bishop stood still for a long time without moving a single muscle.", "*", "Chohong had headed to the border region for Seol Jihu. She shook off countless voices holding her back and ran to the border, but she had no intention of jumping in recklessly.", "It was just that Chohong had baseless confidence that Seol Jihu was alive. She was planning on patrolling the border region in case she might be of help in his escape.", "If she didn\u2019t do at least this, she felt like she would regret it for the rest of her life. However, she received news of Seol Jihu\u2019s return less than a day after her departure. Immediately, she turned her carriage around.", "As soon as she arrived in Haramark, she ran to Luxuria\u2019s temple. She grabbed the Earthling working as the reception lady by her collar and strangled Seol Jihu\u2019s whereabouts out of her. As soon as she kicked the door open and burst into the room he was staying in\u2026.", "\u201c?\u201d", "She could see the young man sitting on a bed. She studied him carefully, and indeed, it really was him. She panted to catch her breath\u2026", "\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d", "But her mouth automatically closed in the next moment. She had many things she wanted to say to him, but her mouth refused to open now that he was in front of her.", "She was both happy and sad. A part of her even wanted to beat him to a pulp. It was a strange, confusing feeling.", "\u201cSay something.\u201d", "After exchanging glances for a long time, Chohong finally spoke up.", "\u201cWhat are you looking at? You forgot my face in just a week?\u201d", "She spoke curtly out of embarrassment, but Seol Jihu showed signs of being confused and taken aback.", "\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d", "He stammered a bit before quietly muttering.", "\u201cWho\u2026 are you?\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s brows twitched.", "\u201cWho are you, you said? You\u2026 are you mad? Is there a problem with your brain?\u201d", "Seol Jihu then put on a dejected look.", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "\u201cW-What?\u201d", "\u201cI, I recently got into a huge accident.

You\u2019re just messing with me again, aren\u2019t you!?\u201d", "She shouted angrily, but her voice of shaking. Her heart began to pound as a sense of unease crept up inside her. The way Seol Jihu massaged his temples really made him look like he was confused.", "\u201cBy any chance\u2026 do you know me?\u201d", "When he carefully asked her this, Chohong\u2019s legs almost gave in.", "\u201c\u2026You\u2026.\u201d", "She suddenly remembered the moment before their attempted escape.

Everything is just a mess\u2026.\u201d", "Chohong collected her breath. She couldn\u2019t believe it; no, she didn\u2019t want to believe it.

Her throat trembled as her eyes flickered with a cold gleam. Seol Jihu could even sense a murderous intent rising up in the air.

In truth, Chohong could have easily shaken him off, but she couldn\u2019t do so since she knew he was injured.", "Soon, after he barely managed to drag Chohong to the bed, he rubbed his palms together and begged for forgiveness. He had no excuses to offer, and after putting himself in her shoes, he truly felt apologetic.", "As he was listening to Chohong\u2019s endless cursing, the sound of the door opening rang out.

Ah, yes.\u201d", "\u201cWho the hell cares about fruits? I brought some liquor, so let\u2019s have a party.\u201d", "\u201cAre you mad?

Otherwise, I\u2019m going to explode from anger because of that bastard!\u201d", "Maria and Chohong bickered as usual, and Agnes calmly peeled fruits on the side. Seol Jihu never expected Maria and Agnes to both come visit him. However, those two weren\u2019t the only guests. In fact, they were just the beginning.", "Thud!", "A black man kicked the door open just like Chohong. He stomped into the room and immediately embraced Seol Jihu.", "\u201cSeol!

At the same time, a big grin emerged on his face when he thought they all came to see him. He tried to hold back his joy, but his mouth refused to listen.", "\u201cHaha.\u201d", "In the end, joyous laughter escaped his mouth. Chohong grumbled, asking what the hell he was laughing about, but his laughter continued without stopping.", "\u2018This is fun.\u2019", "He didn\u2019t know why, but Seol Jihu found this moment surrounded by people happy. He was so happy that he wanted time to stop. It was to the point that he\u2026 didn\u2019t want to go back to Earth."]}
