{"cid": "205", "title": "Chapter 205. The Lucky Charm Soul", "content": ["Weighing the importance of things \u2014 it meant to distinguish between what was important and what wasn\u2019t, and to get one\u2019s priorities straight.", "In truth, what Seol Jihu wanted to do the most was to train. As he had just advanced to Level 5, he wanted to quickly learn the skills befitting a High Ranker. He also wanted to re-harmonize his mind, body, and technique, which hadn\u2019t made any progress in a while.", "But there was something that was even more important \u2014 to transform Carpe Diem from a team to an organization.", "To do this, he had to move to Eva, where he promised to meet Hao Win, but Jang Maldong had placed three conditions he had to fulfill before then.", "Since he had already won over an influential organization, that condition was fulfilled.", "Jang Maldong telling Seol Jihu to organize the team before spreading Carpe Diem\u2019s influence meant to have a solid foundation and wasn\u2019t anything too difficult.", "But Seol Jihu had no choice but to accept the cold reality at the condition of acquiring enough funding for expansion.", "In truth, Seol Jihu had never been short of money ever since his arrival in Paradise. Well, except for when he was trying to recruit the Yi siblings.", "He had amassed quite a wealth, but it was a different story if the talk wasn\u2019t on an individual scale, but at an organizational one.", "Jang Maldong had once criticized Earthlings for playing real estate in Paradise. Meaning, land trade was just as popular here as on Earth.", "Strictly speaking, Paradise\u2019s land wasn\u2019t for buying or selling. All territory within a city was under the permanent jurisdiction of the Royal Family in charge of the city.", "However, some Royal Families set aside land for themselves and the livelihood of Paradisians, issuing land transaction permits for the remaining land and allowing Earthlings to buy and sell them.", "While the permit only gave Earthlings partial rights to the land, these rights also included the right to construct buildings.", "In other words, the Royal Families only traded the right to the ownership of land, with Earthlings having the right to the buildings built on top of them.", "This wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing if not for the rich and powerful having total control over Paradise. The influential organizations of each city acquired large regions of land from the Royal Families and made money by reselling these to other Earthlings.", "That was why concepts such as building-for-sale and monthly rent existed in Paradise.", "The Royal Families were rather speechless as they witnessed these events. They had signed a long-term lease for the land for reasonable prices, but buyers of the land were having a blast playing with money.", "Of course, this was yet another problem of the Earthlings.", "\u2018If only we could just chase them all out\u2026.\u2019", "In any case, the need for money was unchanged, so Seol Jihu racked his brains for a long time.", "\u2018I still have the Golden Eggs, so we should be good for now\u2026 no, monthly rent is a no-go.\u2019", "Renting a building and paying a monthly amount for its use could be doable for a few months, but they would quickly run into a wall. In reality, Seol Jihu was troubled by the fact that it was hard to liquidate most of the valuable items he possessed.", "The cleanest method was directly trading with the Royal Family\u2019s administration to receive a long-term lease and construct a building themselves.", "The problem was that the price of land wasn\u2019t cheap, and the added price of erecting a building easily pushed the total cost into billions.", "\u2018I should have said yes when he said he\u2019d help.\u2019", "Seol Jihu now regretted declining Hao Win\u2019s offer to help them move. He had spoken with courage, wanting to do this himself, but he now realized it was nothing more than bravado.", "\u2018Should I look for a place on the outskirts of the city?\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s worry deepened.", "*", "Flone was the first one to notice Seol Jihu\u2019s worries. Recently, she had been spending most of her time next to Seol Jihu. To be precise, she was spending more and more of her time in the pendant.", "Although she merrily wandered about when she was first released, there wasn\u2019t much to see within a limited space. When there was nothing new to see, her interest in going out naturally dwindled.", "Her boredom was so unbearable that she was starting to get discontent at Seol Jihu for only wandering around the same places every day.", "But because Seol Jihu\u2019s mood was almost permanently downcast, she found it nigh impossible to express her dissatisfaction.", "She could see at a glance that his face was wrought with worry.", "Even today, he had spent quite a bit of time standing in front of the plaza\u2019s noticeboard, sighing his heart out. He then returned home before clutching his head and rolling around on his bed grunting.", "Eventually, Flone asked, unable to bear seeing him so distressed.", "[What\u2019s wrong? Are you worried about something?]", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t react.", "Flone tilted her head before plucking a tree branch and poking him with it. Only then did Seol Jihu raise his head.", "\u201c\u2026That hurts.\u201d", "[Why the frown? You better spit it out now!]", "Hearing\u2019s Flone intimidating talk, the crest-fallen Seol Jihu opened his mouth.", "\u201cIt\u2019s because of money. I need money, but I don\u2019t have any\u2026.\u201d", "Blurring the end of his speech, he gritted his teeth before shouting, \u201cStupid money, money, money!\u201d", "Flone tilted her head and asked.", "[Money? Can\u2019t you go get some?]", "Seol Jihu gave a dull smile.", "\u201cI need a good amount. Well, every little bit counts, so it\u2019s true that I could save up enough until I eventually meet my goal. I just don\u2019t know how long it will take\u2026.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t as if Carpe Diem always had a mission, and even if it did, it was impossible to meet his goals with just the mission completion rewards.", "Seol Jihu rolled around some more on the bed and murmured.", "\u201cI need a way to make enough in one go\u2026.\u201d", "[No, I mean\u2014]", "Flone spoke as if she was frustrated.", "[I was going to ask you about this anyways. Since you said you need money, why not go get it!?]", "\u201c?\u201d", "Noticing that something was up, a question mark popped up Seol Jihu\u2019s head.", "Flone pointed at the pendant.", "[This, I mean! This! Grandpa\u2019s secret!]", "Seol Jihu finally stopped rolling.", "[Remember how Grandpa said he hid all of the family\u2019s wealth before going to the emperor\u2019s villa?]", "[Don\u2019t be surprised. He said this pendant has the coordinates of the hidden wealth!]", "Was it when he first heard about the Parasite army\u2019s advance? Barely remembering what he heard back at the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain, Seol Jihu shot up from his bed.", "\u201cThe inheritance!\u201d", "[Yeah!]", "Seol Jihu turned towards Flone. When he stepped forward with his eyes blazing, Flone shrunk back.", "[W-W-What? You\u2019re scaring me.]", "\u201cFlone\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu grabbed Flone\u2019s hips tight. Suddenly caught, Flone wriggled, telling him to let go.", "\u201cPlease\u2026 I really need\u2026 ah, can I have it?\u201d", "[Yeah, it doesn\u2019t have an owner anyways.]", "\u201cBut it\u2019s your inheritance.\u201d", "[I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m dead anyway. Feel free to use it however you want.]", "Seol Jihu became dazed. Sometimes, Flone talked about being dead too nonchalantly. Well, perhaps he shouldn\u2019t care so much about it either seeing as how she didn\u2019t consider it a big deal.", "[That\u2019s only if you can find it though.]", "Seol Jihu was about to jump in happiness before being struck down by Flone\u2019s words. He suddenly had a feeling that it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.", "[Grandpa said he hid his wealth in five different places.]", "\u201cHe split them? Why?\u201d", "[What do you mean? What idiot hides all their wealth in one place?]", "When Flone asked back, Seol Jihu became speechless.", "[Grandpa was super careful, you know? Even that greedy emperor gave up trying to find these places!]", "Right, they were talking about the wealth of the entire Rothschear family. Since the Rothschears were famous for their immense wealth, Seol Jihu could only imagine how much Flone\u2019s grandfather had hidden away.", "[He said he separated them by type\u2026 hnng.]", "Groaning like a puppy, Flone escaped Seol Jihu\u2019s hands and flew towards the wall. There was a huge map hanging there.", "[The first place is here!]", "Quickly rushing forward and checking the map, Seol Jihu\u2019s expression sank. This was because Flone\u2019s index finger was pointing at the heart of the Empire.", "\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you say he hid them outside the Empire?\u201d", "[You know what they say, it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s right beneath your nose.]", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201cThat place is a bit\u2026. The Parasite Queen is there. If we go, I can promise you we\u2019ll be dead before we even get there. Absolutely.\u201d", "[Really? What a shame. Important documents and account records are buried there\u2026.]", "Flone muttered in disappointment, but Seol Jihu\u2019s expression became a bit brighter. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t know their real value until he saw them, but these documents didn\u2019t sound so important to him now. After all, it wasn\u2019t as if he was going to live in the Empire.", "[Then the next one is\u2026]", "Flone\u2019s finger slid down the map.", "Seol Jihu clasped his hands and prayed earnestly.", "Please don\u2019t let it be in the Parasites\u2019 territory.", "However, Flone\u2019s index finger pointed at the Parasites\u2019 territory again. Although they were no longer in the territory of the old Empire, it was a rear area that was far apart from the human territory.", "[This is where antiques and offerings are buried.]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes shot open.", "\u201cOfferings? Your grandfather kept offerings separately as well?]", "[Of course. The Rothschear family served the Goddess of Chastity (Castitas) of the Seven Virtues. We were in charge of holding Ceremonies every season.]", "\u201cThen the quality of those offerings must be amazing.\u201d", "[That goes without saying. The Goddess of Chastity really liked items with holy power, so I remember Grandpa always making special requests for them from the temple.]", "Seol Jihu swallowed hard.", "This place was in a different situation than the first place, and the inheritance buried there was difficult to give up.", "Although it being inside the Parasites\u2019 territory still weighed on his mind, it wasn\u2019t as if there wasn\u2019t a way around it.", "Since Paradise was round, couldn\u2019t he get there in a roundabout way somehow\u2026?", "[Oh, and this is where gold, silver, and other treasures are buried.]", "Seol Jihu paused his train of thought and looked at the map again. This place was also in the Parasites\u2019 territory, but it was still the frontier area.", "Perhaps Seol Jihu had gotten a bit bolder after going to the ancient emperor\u2019s villa, because he felt this place wasn\u2019t so out of reach.", "[If you want to carry everything back, you\u2019ll probably need about ten large carts.]", "Flone spoke proudly, clearly wanting to boast about the wealth of her family.", "\u2018That much\u2026?\u2019", "[The treasures there might really be forming a mountain! So? So?]", "Flone chattered, hurriedly asking for his reaction.", "Seol Jihu stared at her fixedly before\u2026", "\u201cHic.\u201d", "\u2026suddenly crying.", "Flone jumped in shock.", "[Y-You\u2019re crying!? Why are you crying!?]", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head immediately.", "\u201cI\u2019m just happy\u2026 my worries were solved in an instant\u2026.\u201d", "[Things must have been hard for you until now. I mean, that\u2019s what it looked like.]", "Flone patted Seol Jihu\u2019s head. He wiped his tears before nodding.", "\u201cI\u2019m happy. I really am. Now I can find a place to call home, buy a new spear, a new armor, and\u2026\u201d", "[Spear?]", "\u201cYeah\u2026 The one I used to have broke during the war\u2026.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t even remember when it broke. But when he woke up, the spear was nowhere to be found. He was later told that the spear was shattered completely, and there was no need to even mention his armor.", "[Great. Then what about this place?]", "Seol Jihu sniffled while following Flone\u2019s finger. This was the only place that wasn\u2019t in the Parasite\u2019s territory.", "\u2018Wait.\u2019", "Something about the location was strange. It wasn\u2019t the Parasites\u2019 territory\u2026 but a border region\u2026", "With the Federation.", "[The Rothschear family\u2019s valuable items are buried in this place, so it should have a weapon that catches your fancy.]", "Suddenly growing curious, Seol Jihu asked.", "\u201cWas your family a merchant family?\u201d", "[\u2026What?]", "Flone replied a beat late. She seemed slightly angry.", "\u201cI got curious all of a sudden. With how wealthy they were, I was wondering if they were famous as a weapon merchant.\u201d", "[Weaaaapon merchaaant?]", "Her voice instantly turned sharp.", "[No way! You say the Rothschear family became famous through selling weapons!?]", "Flone jumped.", "[Meanie!? How could you say something like that? Do you think it\u2019s possible for a family in charge of Ceremonies to be merchants?]", "Seol Jihu became speechless, seeing how Flone was acting like she had been insulted greatly.", "Although he couldn\u2019t understand why she was so mad, he apologized for offending her.", "\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not knowledgeable about these things\u2026.\u201d", "[You really don\u2019t know a thing, huh! Fine, I\u2019ll tell you just once, so listen up!]", "Flone yelled like a pouting kid and continued.", "[The Rothschears are one of the four deeply-rooted families, who founded the Empire. They\u2019re also a duke, which only the founding contributors of the Empire can become.]", "\u201cFour families?\u201d", "[Gorgonu, crowned as the emperor and known as the Heart of the Empire! Rhetinhen, the Shield of the Empire! Monpansha, the Eyes and the Head of the Empire! And Rothschear, the \u2018Spear of the Empire\u2019!]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "[What\u2019s buried here is our family\u2019s sacred artifact!]", "\u201cWait, you mean\u2014\u201d", "[That\u2019s right! I\u2019m talking about the Spear of Purity, which Goddess Castitas has bestowed our founding patriarch! You thought I was talking about some items to sell at an auction?]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped.", "A weapon bestowed by a god?", "He couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine how powerful such a weapon would be.", "[Of course, I know that the emperor\u2019s Gorgonu family was unrivaled in my time, but still!]", "\u201cOooh! Rothschear! Ooooooh!\u201d", "Seol Jihu gave a fervent applause. Finally getting the reaction she wanted, Flone \u2018hmphed\u2019 before placing her hands on her waist and strutting her chest out.", "[It\u2019s fine if you know now. Anyways, where do you want to go?]", "Greed filled Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes as he looked at the map. He was faced with happy worries, which was choosing which place to go first.", "His head was telling him to choose money, but his heart was shouting for the spear.", "\u2018An, an artifact from the Empire\u2026 and one that was bestowed by a god\u2026.\u2019", "Swallowing his saliva, Seol Jihu glanced at the proudly floating Flone.", "\u201cFlone, this place doesn\u2019t just have the spear, right?\u201d", "[Ei, how could it?]", "\u201cRight? It must have something else, right? Like decorations and a little bit of gold and silver.\u201d", "[Probably. Grandpa split them into categories, but I doubt he separated it completely\u2026 But why?]", "Seol Jihu licked his lips.", "\u201cNothing. But how much do you think will be there?\u201d", "[Mm\u2026 there\u2019s no way to find out until we get there ourselves\u2026 but don\u2019t hold your hopes up too high. I doubt there\u2019s going to be a lot.]", "\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t it at least have what the emperor\u2019s villa did?\u201d", "[Eh? What are you talking about?]", "Flone snorted and waved her hand.", "[It obviously will have more than that.]", "\u2018As I thought.\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes sparkled. Rubbing his hands together, he asked again.", "\u201cSo, about how much?\u201d", "[Mm\u2026 I would say at least a few boxes of gold coins.]", "Cough!", "Seol Jihu coughed loudly.", "\u2018Dear god!\u2019", "A tiny fraction of the family wealth was a few boxes of gold coins!?", "There was no need to hesitate any longer. Seol Jihu set his next destination on the spot.", "Although there was still one place he hadn\u2019t heard about, he could do so at a later time.", "\u2018This is enough for now.\u2019", "The moment he made up his mind\u2026", "\u201cUhehehehe.\u201d", "Dollar signs appeared in Seol Jihu\u2019s pupils, which began to spin like a slot machine.", "[!?]", "The giggling Flone flinched in surprise.", "[W-What\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t make that face. It\u2019s scary and weird.]", "\u201cFlone\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu ignored her plea and stared at her with profound affection.", "\u201cAre you my lucky charm? Or an incarnation of Lady Luck herself?\u201d", "[W-What are you talking about all of a sudden? Go away. Shoo!]", "Flone hurriedly turned around, trying to escape. But unable to restrain his happiness, Seol Jihu\u2026", "\u201cFLONE!\u201d", "\u2026spread his arms and pounced.", "[MUEEEEE!]", "Flone screamed.", "\u201cHurray!\u201d", "[Don\u2019t touch me! You can\u2019t do that to a maiden\u2026!]", "\u201cHurray Flone!\u201d", "[Uaaaang, I\u2019ll kill you!]", "Screams and giggles continued to ring in the room for a long time. Thankfully, no one else was in Carpe Diem\u2019s office."]}
