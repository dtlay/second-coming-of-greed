Chohong promptly kicked her butt.", "\u201cOi, what are you gonna do? Hurry up and decide.\u201d", "\u201cYou gotta agree if you have a conscience~\u201d", "Hugo rubbed it in, knowing how Maria must be feeling.", "\u201cOb\u2026\u201d", "\u201cOb?\u201d", "\u201cObbiwusly\u2026 I agwee\u2026\u201d", "Because she was speaking through her clenched teeth, the group needed some time before they could understand what she said.", "Just like that, Flone came to receive a share of the loot. Since she was fully justified, this was a clean method that drowned out any controversy.", "Seol Jihu chuckled, not knowing his share of the loot would increase this way.", "Teresa winked at him secretly, while Maria cried. She must have been more than a little upset as she was bawling her eyes out.", "Seol Jihu burst into laughter as he patted the wailing Maria.", "\u201cThings ended up turning out this way\u2026 but I never thought you would be the one to bring it up first, Mister Kazuki.\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 I tried to do my best, but this was the first time I felt sorry about taking my share of the loot in an expedition.\u201d", "Kazuki replied flatly, then glanced at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cNow that you\u2019ve secured the funding, will you be moving to Eva right away?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you\u2019ll make an organization in Eva.\u201d", "\u201cProbably.\u201d", "\u201cWill you have affiliate teams once your organization develops?\u201d", "\u201cHuh\u2026? Affiliate teams?\u201d", "Seol Jihu raised a question while replying nonchalantly. He didn\u2019t get why Kazuki was suddenly asking him all these riddling questions.", "\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d", "Kazuki chortled.", "\u201cNo reason.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s just that, from the perspective of a team, I figured it wouldn\u2019t be bad to work under a leader who\u2019s fair in settling personal affairs.\u201d", "He then turned around and began to bag the loot that was out. At that moment, the teary-voiced Maria asked.", "\u201cOh yeah, Oppa, what are you going to do with the treasure chest?\u201d", "\u201cTreasure chest?\u201d", "\u201cUn, un. The spear is yours, but you haven\u2019t opened the treasure chest yet.\u201d", "Seol Jihu went \u2018Ah!\u2019. He was so focused on settling accounts that he had forgotten about the spear and the treasure chest.", "\u201cNo one opened the treasure chest yet?\u201d", "\u201cIt won\u2019t open.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea cut in.", "\u201cWe can\u2019t see any keyhole. It won\u2019t budge even if we try to open it forcefully. It looks like it\u2019s made to be shock-absorbing.\u201d", "[Hmph, of course.]", "Flone must have been listening in as her voice rang out in Seol Jihu\u2019s head.", "[The family\u2019s secret techniques are in there. How could it open so easily?]", "Flone seemed to know how to open it, so Seol Jihu decided to take a look at the spear and the chest.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s announcement must have touched Chohong and Hugo as they presented the items respectfully. The first thing that caught his attention was obviously the long, cloth-wrapped item.", "\u201cTake the cloth off and have a look. I\u2019m not an expert at discerning the value of weapons, but it looked extremely precious even at a glance. You can tell just by how it looks.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea\u2019s words raised Seol Jihu\u2019s expectations by a notch.", "\u2018Spear, spear\u2026\u2019", "As this spear was one of his main goals for this expedition, he couldn\u2019t help but be curious about it.", "Ba-thump! Ba-thump! His heart pounded.", "Seol Jihu did his best to soothe the beating that shook all his organs and carefully grabbed onto the cloth.", "He took a deep breath. Then, as soon as he unwrapped the cloth, the spear finally revealed itself.", "And Seol Jihu\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u2026looked down at the spear unknowingly.", "\u201c\u2026Ah!!\u201d", "An exclamation of awe burst out a beat later.", "\u2018Pretty\u2026.\u2019", "His first impression of the \u2018Spear of Purity\u2019, which he finally got to see, was that it was \u2018pretty\u2019. He knew that it wasn\u2019t an appropriate descriptor for a weapon, but the spear\u2019s outer appearance truly boasted a captivating beauty. It was so much so that he mistook it for a figure of an alluring woman.", "After gulping out loud, Seol Jihu carefully observed the spear.", "First, the spear was extremely long. From the spear blade reflecting the moonlight and emitting a bewitching light, the long, willow branch-like spear shaft well surpassed 2 meters and 40 centimeters.", "It was a whole lot taller than Seol Jihu.", "The spear carried a transparent-white tone. Really, without a single bit of exaggeration, its clarity made it completely transparent. It really looked as if it was created by carving out ice.", "Other than that, there were two elements that caught his attention.", "The first was that the spear blade itself was 50 centimeters long. The lower part of the frame forming the blade started out thick and got increasingly sharper, and two crescent-shaped blades were attached to the side of the blade. No matter how he looked at it, it resembled the twin crescent-bladed halberd used by the Three Kingdoms\u2019 Warlord L\u00fc Bu.", "The second was that seven circular grooves were dug out on the upper part of the spear shaft. Insetting the jewels he put away in his bag would undoubtedly make it look even better.", "\u2018So this is that spear\u2026\u2019", "The Spear of Purity, which the Goddess of Chastity\u2014 Castitas\u2014 is said to have bestowed to the Rothschear House.", "It completely caught Seol Jihu\u2019s fancy.", "He drew a huge gulp and examined the spear.", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give it a swing?\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea suggested in a timely manner, and Seol Jihu promptly grabbed the spear with an entranced expression.", "\u201c!\u201d", "Seol Jihu flinched. The moment he grabbed the spear, cold energy invaded his body and stung his bones.", "Although the coldness disappeared in an instant, it was enough to jolt his consciousness wide-awake.", "Soon, he grabbed ahold of his mind and raised the spear, but he was surprised yet again.", "\u2018I-It\u2019s heavy?\u2019", "A heaviness that surpassed his wildest imaginations could be felt from his hands. No\u2014", "\u2018It\u2019s not that it\u2019s heavy.\u2019", "Whoosh, whoosh! He became certain once he roused his mana and forcefully gave it a couple of swings.", "Rather than heaviness, it was more correct to call it resistance. Right, the Spear of Purity was resisting him.", "Whether he stabbed or sliced, the spear blade strayed from his intended mark. As it was now, it couldn\u2019t be called a proper weapon.", "Aside from its beauty, it didn\u2019t look like it had a special power either.", "He activated his Nine Eyes just to be sure, but even the \u2018General Observation\u2019 couldn\u2019t view its information.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "The Star of Lust, Seo Yuhui.And the Star of Sloth, Taciana Cinzia.", "This was only the third time that he couldn\u2019t view the status window with the green color.", "He had a guess. These three all shared one common point \u2014 that they received a god\u2019s power.", "With this, Seol Jihu was convinced that this spear carried divine power. But he was also certain that the spear was useless as it was now.", "\u2018Is there a ceremony I need to do to be recognized as its owner\u2026?\u2019", "What should he do to drag out the spear\u2019s original strength?", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes instinctively turned to the sealed treasure chest. For some reason, he felt like the solution to his problem would be in it.", "However, it was just like what Marcel Ghionea said.", "\u201cKeuk!\u201d", "The chest refused to open, no matter how hard he tried to pull it open. By the time he had half-given up from exhaustion, Seol Jihu heard a sudden giggle.", "When he looked down at his pendant, the giggle immediately stopped.", "[You see the insignia in the middle, right? Try putting your pendant next to it.]", "\u201c\u2026You could have told me earlier.\u201d", "[Sorry, sorry, it was just too funny seeing you struggle to open it\u2026.]", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips before getting on his knees and putting the pendant next to the Rothschear House\u2019s insignia.", "Next, a mysterious light suddenly flickered from the insignia\u2014", "Clunk!", "And the chest opened, just like that.", "\u201cOh! It opened!\u201d", "\u201cWhat? What, what?\u201d", "The expedition team huddled together and peeked into the chest.", "Soon\u2026", "\u201cEh? What the heck\u2026?\u201d", "Maria trailed off with a greatly disappointed look. But perhaps she was justified as the contents of the chest were far smaller compared to its size.", "Inside were two battered books and a small wooden box.", "Characters they had never seen before were written on the faded books, but the Synchronization must have taken effect as they soon wiggled and changed into Earth\u2019s language.", "Phi Sora furrowed her brows.", "\u201cRighteous Heart? Crescent Blade Spear Technique? What\u2019s up with these middle school syndrome names?\u201d", "[What did you say?]", "Flone got angry.", "Seol Jihu took his eyes off the book and picked up the wooden box.", "Click.", "Once opened, a red light gently leaked out of the gap. What appeared underneath was something completely unexpected.", "Hugo let out an empty chuckle.", "\u201c\u2026The heck is that? An egg?\u201d", "Just like he said, an oval egg was placed in the wooden box. To be more precise, the smooth surface of the small egg, which looked just like a red jade, gave off a delicate scarlet light.", "\u2018Jeez.\u2019", "Setting the two books aside, Seol Jihu could only sigh as he had no clue how the egg and the Spear of Purity were related.", "[Castitas, the Goddess of Chastity, bestowed the family with the sacred artifact, the Spear of Purity, which housed the Elemental Spirit, Arcus. The family thus came to be called the Spear of the Empire\u2026]", "[They are said to be protected by a mythical guardian Phoenix that symbolizes joy.]", "That was what was written in the historical records.", "\u201cSpear of the Empire\u2026 Do I have to awaken the Arcus Spirit and be acknowledged?\u201d", "Just as he lamented over his current situation\u2026", "[Eh? You knew?]", "Flone\u2019s voice rang out.", "\u201cWhat do you mean, I knew?\u201d", "[You said it just now. That you have to get the Phoenix\u2019s acknowledgment.]", "\u201cHuh\u2026? Didn\u2019t I say Arcus Spirit?\u201d", "[Hm? What do you mean? Arcus Spirit is a Phoenix.]", "\u2018What?\u2019", "Seol Jihu had to reorganize his thoughts due to Flone\u2019s confused rebuttal.", "\u2018That means\u2026 the two are one and the same?\u2019", "More questions flooded into his brain, but he decided to ask the more urgent question first.", "\u201cFlone, do you know how to awaken this Phoenix Arcus Spirit?\u201d", "[You have to hatch it.]", "Seol Jihu became dazed. This had been a series of shocking realizations. A Spirit wasn\u2019t a bird, so how was he supposed to hatch it?", "[Use that.]", "The pendant rattled, pointing to the red egg.", "Seol Jihu blinked.", "*", "Along with settling accounts, the distribution of goods ended. Seol Jihu split the loot based on the rule he\u2019d set out before the expedition, with him getting an additional portion for Flone.", "He took home four gold bars, 178 gold eggs, 267 chunks of silver, 12,444 silver coins, 1,200 gems, and 20 offerings. The Spear of Purity and the contents of the treasure chest were also his property.", "Although his comrades only received half of what he did, that didn\u2019t change the fact that it was an incredible amount.", "Once the difficult settlement ended, a belated dinner and a small festival broke out. The expedition team ate and drank to their hearts\u2019 content and chattered excitedly.", "\u201cEquipment for sure!\u201d", "Hugo spoke with a stern, serious face.", "\u201cI\u2019m going to bounce to Scherezade the moment I return to Haramark. I\u2019ll go to the auction house and plaster myself in equipment befitting a High Ranker. With top-grade items and nothing less.\u201d", "\u201cHa!\u201d", "Chohong sneered.", "\u201cTop-grade Level 5 items? Hilarious.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny about that!?\u201d", "\u201cFirst off, you don\u2019t even know if there will be any for sale, and fine, let\u2019s say there is. You\u2019re going to spend all the money you made? Why don\u2019t you try to save up at least a little bit?\u201d", "\u201cWhy are you bitching about me spending my own money?\u201d", "\u201cWell, you\u2019re right.\u201d", "Chohong readily agreed, then smirked.", "\u201cBut, as a High Ranker, it\u2019s a bit unsightly seeing a Level 4 blabber on about High Ranker items.\u201d", "\u201cSay what!?\u201d", "Hugo glared at her furiously. However, he quickly grinned and turned to the side. As soon as he saw Seol Jihu sitting on the other side, warming himself up next to the campfire, he pounced on him.", "\u201cSeooooool!\u201d", "\u201c!?\u201d", "Suddenly being bear-hugged by a large figure, Seol Jihu jumped in fright.", "\u201cW-What?\u201d", "\u201cSeol! Seooooool!\u201d", "Hugo was determined.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry~ Don\u2019t throw me away~ Huaaang~\u201d", "He clung to Seol Jihu\u2019s waist and pretended to weep.", "\u201cI\u2019ll always listen to you from now~ Don\u2019t throw me away~ Huaaaang~\u201d", "Then, he abruptly stopped talking and turned back.", "Teresa covered her mouth and burst into laughter.", "Chohong had her mouth shut, glaring at Hugo as if to kill him. Her cheeks flushed red as she began to tremble.", "Hugo grinned.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t say this was anyone\u2019s dream!\u201d", "\u201cYou son of a bitch\u2014\u201d", "\u201cHuh? What was that? Talk more? You want me to go into more detail?\u201d", "\u201cKeuk!\u201d", "Chohong grit her teeth. Hugo put on airs and let go of Seol Jihu.", "\u201cDon\u2019t get cheeky now. If you do, boom! I\u2019ll just\u2014! You know?\u201d", "Surprisingly, Chohong fell silent even though her face was contorting in fury.", "Seol Jihu giggled, watching the scene unfold. On the other hand, he felt a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. He felt like he had experienced a similar situation.", "\u2018In my dream.\u2019", "Seol Jihu stared at Maria, who was busy flicking the beads on her abacus.", "That night, the expedition team partied until they fell asleep.", "After confirming that Maria had fallen asleep, he told the two night watches to keep a close eye before using the bags containing the inheritance as a bed.", "The next morning, he almost screamed the moment he woke up.", "The bags were fine.", "But Maria must have woken up before him, as she was squatting nearby, keeping a close eye out on the bags.", "With bloodshot eyes."]}
