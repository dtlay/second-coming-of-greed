It was to withdraw money from the storage.", "At first, he told Kim Hannah to take as much as she wanted from the storage, but she replied with a snort.", "The core of the second attack was money. The more money they had, the higher the chance of success would be.", "But Kim Hannah said they should still spend in moderation, criticizing Seol Jihu for thoughtlessly trying to spend all of the organization\u2019s precious money.", "She didn\u2019t forget to remind him to bring back only a modest amount. It was only after hearing an earful that Seol Jihu came to a realization \u2014 Kim Hannah wasn\u2019t trying to help the Paradisians out of goodwill.", "She said her plan was to shake up the organizations\u2019 main source of revenue \u2014 the nightlife business \u2014 but by the looks of it, that didn\u2019t seem to be her ultimate goal.", "When she was talking to Seo Yuhui, each of her words really made it feel like she was aiming at the organizations.", "Although Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t grasp what big picture Kim Hannah was ultimately drawing, he decided to sit back and watch the so-called Miss Foxy work her magic.", "After all, you couldn\u2019t go wrong with listening to your mom.", "After arriving at the temple, Seol Jihu took out the 20 gold coins that Kim Hannah requested and an additional gold bar without hesitation.", "A gold bar was equivalent to 21 gold coins or 21,000 silver coins. On Earth, that would be worth hundreds of millions of won!", "Since each household had an average of 87 silver coins in debt, just this gold bar would be able to pay off 241 people\u2019s debts, with a margin of error, of course.", "Kim Hannah was busy drawing up documents in her room. Dexterously moving her hand with a serious face, she put her pen down when she heard the door open.", "\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d", "Seol Jihu obediently put down the money pouch. After checking the contents, Kim Hannah smiled in satisfaction.", "\u201cThis should be more than enough as a deposit. It really is nice to be rich.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, it is. Who doesn\u2019t like money? Just look at Miss Maria.\u201d", "\u201cNo, stupid, I meant money gives us more options.\u201d", "Simply put, they could only carry out this plan because they had ample wealth and could easily spare some. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t even have dreamt of it.", "Seol Jihu smiled flatly.", "\u201cRight, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d fight with them using money.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no rule saying that battles have to be conducted with weapons. You can use words, money, or even law, religion, pen, and other things as well.\u201d", "Kim Hannah recited a long list before suddenly looking at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cBut to tell you the truth, this can hardly be called a war. Because we\u2019ll be pummeling them one-sidedly.\u201d", "\u201cOne-sidedly?\u201d", "\u201cThink about it. Does our plan violate the law in any way?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cNo, right? We\u2019re giving out money to Paradisians who are drowning in debt. Who\u2019s going to say anything about it? Sure, they might think we\u2019re acting out of place, but that\u2019s it.\u201d", "\u201cI mean, yeah, what we\u2019re planning to do isn\u2019t illegal, but if you only look at the outcome, our money will end up in the enemy\u2019s hands.\u201d", "What Seol Jihu said wasn\u2019t wrong, but the corner of Kim Hannah\u2019s lip curled up.", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the nightlife here, huh.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean? We went together.\u201d", "\u201cI mean adult entertainment. Or you know, prostitution.\u201d", "Kim Hannah continued with a smirk.", "\u201cAll products have a sale price, and that means there is a difference between the seller\u2019s cost of acquiring products and the selling price, or basically what\u2019s called a margin. And in Paradise, the adult entertainment industry has a high-profit margin. There\u2019s a reason that organizations which favor profit above all, chose this industry as their main business.\u201d", "This made sense. If the industry didn\u2019t make much money, there would be no reason for organizations to operate and maintain them for years.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the profit margin. The reason the adult entertainment industry is so popular in Paradise is that it keeps a small-profit high-volume structure.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re purposely making less profit?\u201d", "\u201cYep. For adult entertainment businesses, you\u2019ll get many customers even if you raise the price a little bit. These people generally won\u2019t hesitate just because the price is slightly higher.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded.", "\u201cBut doing that comes with a risk. The more money you make, the more you will have to pay the girls. Just think. What if their workers made dozens of silver coins every day? They\u2019ll pay off their debts in no time and leave.\u201d", "\u201cSo that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThey bring the girls in by inflating their debt, so they make them work cheap, controlling the price so that they can barely make enough to make ends meet. That way, the girls will work for them longer. After all, that\u2019s better for them in the long run.\u201d", "By the time the long explanation ended, Seol Jihu realized his mouth had gone dry and bitter.", "\u201cSometimes, I get Paradise confused with Earth.\u201d", "\u201cObviously. These businesses are operated by people from Earth.\u201d", "Kim Hannah snorted. At that moment, the door opened with a click, and a grey-haired man walked in. Kim Hannah put on her business smile that immediately brightened up her face.", "\u201cCome in~\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Excuse me.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea looked a little puzzled as he walked in with a big bag in his right hand.", "\u201cYou came back from the temple?\u201d", "\u201cYes, just now.\u201d", "\u201cHow was it? Did you confirm it?\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea sighed before nodding his head.", "\u201cWhat did Superbia say?\u201d", "\u201c\u2018Soon.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cIya~\u201d", "Kim Hannah applauded.", "\u201cCongratulations! And to you too, Jihu. You\u2019ll have another High Ranker in your midst soon.\u201d", "\u201cI always dreamed about reaching Level 5\u2026 Now that I\u2019m finally at the doorstep\u2026\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea looked confused, but not displeased.", "\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect it. To think you could get contribution points with this\u2026\u201d", "That was right. The second benefit Kim Hannah mentioned was contribution points.", "The team members were in disbelief when they first heard it, but Seo Yuhui personally attested to it, citing her personal experience.", "\u201cContribution points are the quantified representation of an individual\u2019s influence on society. As the main objective of Earthlings is the extermination of the Parasites, war is the primary method of amassing contribution points. But if you look carefully enough, you\u2019ll see that there are plenty of other ways.\u201d", "\u201cEarning contribution points with volunteer work\u2026 I thought it would apply only to Priests.\u201d", "\u201cThat just goes to show you how desperate a situation Eva is in. The current relationship between humanity and the Federation is like that of teeth and gum. The VIP auction house and Royal Pattaya were harmful to this precious relationship.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke clearly.", "\u201cNot only did we eliminate this harmful cause, but we also prepared the foundation to restore the two parties\u2019 relationship. On the grand scale of things, there is no reason for the Seven Gods to not approve of this as a contribution.\u201d", "Kim Hannah gave a clear-cut explanation before throwing her gaze down. Marcel Ghionea handed her the sack of money without hesitation. Kim Hannah took it and checked the contents, her eyes widening instantly.", "\u201cThis much?\u201d", "\u201cI got a little greedy.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea spoke in a flushed voice.", "\u201cBecoming a Level 5 is the dream of all Earthlings. It\u2019s the same for me. If I can earn contribution points by attacking Eva\u2019s organizations, I don\u2019t feel that the money I\u2019m spending is a waste.\u201d", "\u201cLooks like you know how to see far. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you get the most out of it.\u201d", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea bowed before turning around and leaving. Seol Jihu watched him with a warm smile.", "\u2018Mister Ghionea is certainly worthy of becoming a Level 5.\u2019", "The Archer of Steel already had a reputation for having high combat prowess. Other organizations and teams must have known he was close to becoming a Level 5, for them to have gone recruiting him as soon as he made his return.", "Seol Jihu felt elated knowing that Carpe Diem would soon have another High Ranker. And before his happiness could subside, the door opened once again.", "It was Chohong.", "She held up a money bag.", "\u201cI\u2019m here to buy contribution points.\u201d", "She wasn\u2019t the only one.", "\u201cYou\u2019re here too, Hugo?\u201d", "\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d", "\u201cShe told me I\u2019m doing well and that I should work hard just a little more\u2026\u201d", "Hugo spoke quietly with reddened cheeks.", "\u201cIra always said, \u2018You think you\u2019re good enough to be a High Ranker?\u2019 To think a day would come when she would encourage me\u2026\u201d", "Hugo came in after Chohong left and placed down a money bag. It had a sizable amount as well.", "Phi Sora was next, followed by Jang Maldong and Seo Yuhui, who also chipped in.", "The opportunity to earn contribution points so safely didn\u2019t come by often, so everyone was very generous. Even the money-grubbing demon was persuaded by Kim Hannah.", "\u201cY-You too, Miss Maria?\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that unbelieving face? Are you that shocked?\u201d", "Grumbling, Maria scurried inside.", "\u201cA Priest\u2019s job is to heal injured people. Pain doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to injuries. If donating money can relieve Paradisians of their pain, I don\u2019t regret it one bit.\u201d", "It was a lie, and such an obvious one, at that.", "Although she was mumbling like she was some virtuous, altruistic person, her hand was shaking violently as she handed over the money bag.", "It was clear she made proper calculations before painfully giving away money. After all, her value would skyrocket once she became a High Ranker Priest.", "\u201cUnni, let\u2019s not skimp out.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, yeah, just let go of your hand.\u201d", "\u201cI really brought it to be used for a good cause. If you pocket even a single copper coin, then you\u2019re really the bitchiest bitch of all bitches.\u201d", "\u201cI got it, so let go! Why are you holding on so tightly?\u201d", "\u201cYou see my name here? Take a good look.\u201d", "Just like she said, the money bag had the name \u2018Maria Yeriel\u2019 clearly written on it. With how tightly Maria was holding onto the bag, Kim Hannah quickly got annoyed.", "\u201cYou know what, keep it. If you can\u2019t trust me, you can do it on your own. Do you think I\u2019m some beggar?\u201d", "\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just making sure.\u201d", "Maria finally loosened her hand. Kim Hannah clicked her tongue.", "\u201cHow much did you even bring?\u201d", "\u201cAlright, see ya!\u201d", "As Kim Hannah was about to look inside, Maria quickly flew off, running away so quickly that Seol Jihu doubted if she had her own Festina Earring which she used three times.", "After checking the contents of the bag, Kim Hannah burst out laughing.", "\u201cFucking lunatic.\u201d", "Then, she suddenly turned serious.", "\u201cI was wondering why it was so heavy. What a joke!\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThat bitch, she\u2019d come to a 100,000 won per person wedding, eat to her heart\u2019s content, and run away after giving an envelope of 5,000 won filled with nothing but 10 won coins.\u201d", "Kim Hannah cursed Maria out before shaking her head.", "\u201cI\u2019m not inviting her to my wedding, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d", "Well, just like that, Carpe Diem gathered quite a sum. After counting the amount, Kim Hannah was astonished.", "\u201cWow\u2026 we\u2019ll easily pass a thousand people with this\u2026\u201d", "She then calculated the funding for livelihood support, buying food, and paying off debts.", "Seol Jihu snooped around, wondering if he could help, but hearing a, \u2018Don\u2019t bother me and go play outside,\u2019 he rolled around on Kim Hannah\u2019s bed.", "\u201cPerfect. This is enough.\u201d", "Soon, Kim Hannah put her pen down and stood up.

As an entirely new world, Paradise\u2019s culture and products often captivated the attention of Earthlings who just entered.", "But just like on Earth, new things would quickly lose their novelty as people got more familiar with them. Not only did leveling up become more difficult with each level, but the price of good equipment also skyrocketed.", "There was naturally a limit to how Paradise could remain attractive to Earthlings.", "They were also stressed out by the repeated battles with no way to relieve this stress. The only way really was to gather together at a pub and drink.", "What appeared at that time was adult entertainment. With this development, not only did Earthlings drink alcohol, but they also enjoyed many other things, such as showing off and fulfilling desires.", "Businesses that Earthlings were already familiar with, paired with exotic women of another race and cheap price \u2014 it was truly the recipe of a gold mine, drawing Earthlings\u2019 attention endlessly.", "King Corona.", "It was the name of a famous adult entertainment business in Eva.
