Jihu! Alright, we\u2019ll buy it! Okay?

It was as if he was looking at a cornered beast.", "Generally speaking, bargaining was a process of finding a compromise, with the buyer gradually raising the offer and the seller slowly lowering the price.", "But there existed a saying amongst the merchants in Paradise.", "There were only three chances when dealing with Miss Foxy. If you failed to satisfy her within three offers, ruthless blows would start raining down under the pretext of negotiations.", "To be more exact, Kim Hannah would start lowering the number that she set as her minimum value.

There were no more opportunities. He only had Seol Jihu left.", "'There\u2019s no one left in Eva who would buy this land!\u2019", "In the end, he shut his eyes and shouted.", "\"If you sign the contract right now, then 29 gold coins!\u201d", "The price fell by half once again. This was the very definition of a massive discount. It was shocking to the point where even Kim Hannah looked surprised.", "\"2-29 gold coins? Really?\"", "Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth gaped as wide as a bowl.", "\"I told you before.

In a way, the only reason I\u2019m still alive and able to do business is all thanks to Seol Jihu-nim. So what if I take a little loss?

A man of great capacity indeed!\u201d", "Park Dongchun hurriedly led him back to the Dongchun Merchants\u2019 building and persuaded him to sign the contract.", "Everything was proceeding rapidly\u2026 until Kim Hannah who sat there with a dejected face threw a tackle.", "\"What is this? Ahjussi. You said you\u2019d sell it to us for 29 gold coins. Why does it say 75 gold coins here?\u201d", "\"Hey, you. Think about my position, too. I don\u2019t want rumors to circulate about me selling it for dirt cheap\u2026 You only have to give me 29 gold coins!\u201d", "\"This is document forgery. You know that, right?\u201d", "\"What document forgery?\"", "Park Dongchun snorted.", "It looked like she was trying to nitpick any faults, but the scale had already tipped in his favor.", "\"We can do this then. Oh my! I just found some gold coins lying around. Are these perhaps Seol Jihu-nim\u2019s?\u201d", "Park Dongchun took out 46 gold coins on the spot and pushed it to Seol Jihu.", "\"Ah. You\u2019re right. Look where I\u2019m putting my mind. Here\u2019s the money.\u201d", "Seol Jihu grinned and added 29 gold coins to the pile before pushing it back to Park Dongchun.", "And after signing the contract, the ownership of the document fell into Seol Jihu\u2019s hands.", "\"Nice doing business with you! Hope you have a safe trip back!\u201d", "Park Dongchun smiled beamingly while bidding them farewell.", "Disposing of utterly worthless trash that wasn\u2019t even worth as much as chicken ribs made him feel like he had removed an aching tooth.", "Since he had gotten himself insurance just in case, how could he not be glad?", "Of course, strictly speaking, he had definitely taken a terrible loss, but the market price of something always fluctuated corresponding to its worth.", "Just like Kim Hannah said, he was originally in a situation where he had to give money to get rid of the land, but he succeeded in selling the deed in an unexpected windfall.", "So it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration for him to be greatly satisfied with salvaging 29 gold coins.", "'Ufufufu. I handed over the deed. Now it\u2019s not my problem anymore!\u2019", "\u2018Ah not mine, not mine~\u2019", "After the two had left, Park Dongchun couldn\u2019t repress his joy and danced like a butterfly.", "*", "Meanwhile.", "Seol Jihu, Kim Hannah, and Flone who had just exited Dongchun Merchants\u2026", "\"Tehehehehehehe\u2014!\u201d", "\"Kekekekekeke\u2014!\u201d", "[Pehehehehehe\u2014!]", "As soon as they arrived at the castle gates, the trio simultaneously exploded into laughter as if they had promised beforehand.", "\"Why are you two laugh-fuhahaha!?\u201d", "\"Why are you laugh-hahaha!?\u201d", "[Stop laugh-hehehe!]", "The three cackled like deranged lunatics.", "In particular, Kim Hannah laughed so hard with her head tilted back that the contracted carriage driver looked at her with a strange gaze.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re allowed to do this.\u201d", "Seol Jihu barely stopped his laughter before boarding the carriage and made a comment with his head tilted.", "\"What\u2019s the issue? A deal is successful if both sides are satisfied.\u201d", "Kim Hannah wiped her tears and spoke clearly. As a matter of fact, the meaning behind having a house was significant in Paradise.", "Like Seol Jihu had experienced back at the Neutral Zone, it was because of \u2018sleep\u2019.", "If it was simply to sleep, then people could simply go back and forth between Paradise and Earth even though it would be a hassle.", "However, sleep in Paradise was very different from that on Earth.", "Just like how a character\u2019s HP and MP would fully recover after a night\u2019s sleep in RPG games, Paradise also had an effect of helping to restore energy and vitality with sleep.", "Naturally, better environments led to greater effects.", "Conversely, if you slept outside on the streets, you would receive negative effects.", "In other words, there was a good reason why Earthlings always slept in an inn or set up proper campsites during expeditions.", "It was for a similar reason that people tried to buy their own houses. Of course, the majority couldn\u2019t even dream of owning a house due to price inflation after the monopoly of several organizations.", "Kim Hannah couldn\u2019t wipe the grin off of her face saying she saved more than 70 gold and that it was definitely one of her top 3 hits in her life at Paradise.", "On the way back, Kim Hannah made a strange request.", "\"Hey! Can you leave the design and construction of the building to me? Everything, including interior decoration.\u201d", "Seol Jihu willingly nodded since he hadn\u2019t had anyone else to ask anyways.", "\"I\u2019d rather have to thank you instead.

Feel free to do whatever you want with it. By the way, you must have been really good at studying.

I\u2019ll call you again sometime soon.\u201d", "\u2014Alright. You\u2019ll only need to prepare the documents when you come to register.
