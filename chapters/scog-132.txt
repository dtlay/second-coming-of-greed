We will be disappointed if you really think that way.]", "Seol Jihu clenched his teeth.

Why do we host the Banquet and make people kill each other?]", "Ira snorted, seemingly having read his mind.", "[Are you asking because you really don\u2019t know the answer? You. What do you think is the reason we summoned Earthlings to this world?]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s expression stiffened.", "The reason was simple \u2014 to save this world which was on the crossroads of ruin.", "And Earthlings received rewards in exchange.", "[It was fine at first, but it became more and more ridiculous as time went by.]", "[Focusing on dealing with the Parasites would have been difficult enough, but they were blinded by the profits in front of them, fighting and killing each other.]", "[They even rose in revolt because they didn\u2019t like what they were summoned to do, attacking and enslaving Paradisians.]", "[Evil\u2026. Evil\u2026.]", "Several voices rang out at once.", "[It\u2019s the same with the Banquet.]", "Ira growled.", "[At first, its purpose was to help Earthlings who couldn\u2019t become High Rankers, and also to give the courageous, talented ones a chance to grow.]", "\u2018But!\u2019", "[Ridiculous! Was the trial we gave impossibly difficult? Do you really think so even though you cleared Stage 2 with 110 people?]", "Having read Seol Jihu\u2019s thoughts, Ira seized the initiative.

This was something he had thought about several times during the Banquet.", "And he had already come up with the answer.", "Just like Prihi said, everyone had \u2018a limit to their vessel\u2019. When those two had ruined the Banquet that Seol Jihu worked hard to correct, they crossed the line.", "That was why he killed them.", "But the burly man was different. Rather than trying to ruin the Banquet, he participated in it earnestly.", "Plus, it wasn\u2019t as if he was verbally rude. If he had at the very least done this, Seol Jihu would have had a reason to do something. But the burly man hadn\u2019t done anything to him.", "An outsider might call Seol Jihu out for having no backbone, but that was really how he felt.", "[If that is the reason, then what about those two?

It is that girl you are mindful of. Because she helped you, you are hesitant.]", "No, that was wrong.", "Slick Hair committed an act that was clearly wrong.", "Although he didn\u2019t personally see what the nameless male-female duo did, it was revealed thanks to Audrey Basler.", "But he couldn\u2019t be sure about the burly man. Because he didn\u2019t have proof that what he saw in his vision was true, he didn\u2019t want to kill him blindly.", "[Why do you think that?]", "Seol Jihu thought that the future of Paradise would flow as he had seen in his dream. He thought so when Kim Hannah came to find him just like he had experienced in his dream.", "But his thoughts changed during his stay in Paradise.", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t a Red Mark and he certainly did toil like a slave. The future had changed.", "He suddenly had this thought.", "What if the vision the Seven Gods showed him didn\u2019t include this change? To be a bit more precise, what if the vision only indicated that it had occurred in the past?

The same went for the incongruity between what the burly man said and what his vision showed.", "Because he being here must have changed the future somehow.", "[Oh yeah?]", "Seol Jihu flinched. This was because Ira\u2019s voice suddenly sounded closer.", "[So you figured it out. You must be quite proud of yourself\u2026.]", "Fufufufu. A low laughter flowed out.", "[Those two\u2026. Right, they didn\u2019t kill Lara Wolff.]", "[But at the end of the day, they still killed someone. Do you still think the future changed?]", "Another voice rang out.", "[All humans are born with their own Star of Fate.]", "Star of Fate? With a cough, Seol Jihu shook his head.", "[The movement of this star rea~lly doesn\u2019t change easily. No matter how much it is disturbed, it continues to advance toward its predetermined fate.]", "[In exchange for Lara Wolff surviving, someone else died. That is the result of a Star of Fate that has broken away from its course trying to return to its original path. This is the reason that the future can\u2019t be changed so easily.]", "These final words lingered in Seol Jihu\u2019s head.", "[We are not killing Earthlings because we hate them or because we are bored. It is because killing them is much more certain than a half-baked attempt at a change.]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s head automatically turned again.", "[He is no different.]", "His gaze landed on the burly man still collapsed on the floor.", "[Just like there are Stars born with the fate of becoming an Executor, there are stars that stand in their opposition.]", "Seol Jihu swallowed hard.", "[Do you still not get it? Then I will tell you. That human is a demon born with the spirit of the Heaven-Slaughtering Star.]", "[It is a vicious fate. He will kill thousands in the future at the very least. Imagine your comrades being included in that number.]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s sweat-carrying, half-closed eyes opened.", "[So? We told you this much. Isn\u2019t that enough justification?]", "Seol Jihu stared at the burly man as he panted. Then, he shook his head.", "[No?]", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t think he was wrong, at least in the present. The burly man had only responded to others\u2019 aggression and did not kill all seven of them.", "He had not crossed the line.", "No matter how small it might be, a change was a change.", "[What\u2026. He is the Heaven-Slaughtering Star!]", "What Ira was saying might be correct, but that was still a future that hadn\u2019t come yet.", "[Hah?]", "The Golden Rule said so. That every effect followed a cause.", "The same words could be applied when talking about the future. At the current moment, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t rashly decide whether that burly man was the so-called Heaven-Slaughtering Star.", "If it was true that Seol Jihu himself killed thousands of people when he lived in Paradise as a Red Mark slave, then there was surely a reason for that as well.", "In that case, he simply had to alter the cause that would result in the Heaven-Slaughtering Star.", "Whether that be erasing it or changing it, as long as the cause changed, the effect would certainly change as well.", "When Seol Jihu\u2019s thoughts reached this point\u2026.", "[Hohohoho, huhuhuhu!]", "[Ahahaha!]", "[Hehehe!]", "[Puhahahahehehe!]", "[Kik\u2026 kik\u2026.]", "The gods suddenly burst into laughter. There were two gods who didn\u2019t laugh.", "Under the flurry of laughter that resounded his eardrums, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but wonder.", "\u2018Why are they laughing?\u2019", "He thought he could do it. That he could achieve it.", "[Huu, huu. It is like they say! Courage and bravado are only a paper\u2019s width apart!]", "As if she found what he said absurdly funny, Ira\u2019s voice was much rougher than before.", "[Hoh\u2026. He really thinks he can do it.]", "[Wow. How much of an idealistic world is this child hoping for? It really makes my heart beat~]", "[It is nothing to be surprised about. He has no idea what he even said.]", "[Fufu, he reminds me of the Martial God who saw and regretted being unable to reach one of the branches of the World Tree\u2019s future.]", "[Something\u2026 that even he couldn\u2019t achieve\u2026. This boy wants to\u2026 achieve that\u2026?]", "At that moment\u2013", "[I believe it is possible.]", "Luxuria\u2019s voice spread out soothingly.", "Suffering from all sorts of emotions, Seol Jihu fell to his knees at last. He could feel his body becoming more and more fatigued due to the prolonged meeting with the gods.", "[The Banquet had fallen into depravity, yet this child managed to return it to a true banquet. Also, he has already succeeded in changing one person\u2019s color.]", "Seol Jihu could feel a gentle hand stroking his head. It seemed to be sympathizing with him.", "[So I think we can give him a chance. It isn\u2019t as if we don\u2019t have time.]", "[Chance, you say!?]", "[Stop.]", "A languid voice stopped the ire of a certain god.", "Gula had stepped in.", "[Let us stop here.

Any more and this child will not be able to handle it.]", "[You mean to let the Heaven-Slaughtering Star go!?]", "[There is no other choice. We are the one who gave this child the right to end Stage 3. He made his decision from his own will. The Banquet should have ended at that point.]", "Silence descended in the room.", "If anything, it was true that Seol Jihu was exhausted to the limit. Just being in the Chamber of Awakening for a moment had drained him of his energy. But here, he had been facing them far longer than last time.", "If he stayed any longer, his life would be at risk.", "[No, not yet.]", "Ira refused.", "[I will not tolerate you playing with my child as you please.]", "Gula\u2019s voice also carried a hint of wrath.", "[Fine. We can go back.

However\u2014", "[No, how could we? We must bestow a reward befitting of Stage 3\u2019s name. Don\u2019t you agree?]", "Ira refused immediately before speaking quietly.", "[Nine Eyes. We shall go with that.]", "[Preposterous.]", "Gula cut in as if she expected Ira to say this.", "[This child is not ready yet.

We shall grant him this one direction.]", "[Similar to the left direction, the right direction of the Nine Eyes has to be opened simultaneously.]", "[I know. But I will bear the consequences.]", "[\u2026.]", "[Do you have anything else to say?]", "With Ira going this far, Gula had nothing to say.", "Ira seemed to want to open the right side no matter what.", "[But why? Is there a reason you are going this far?]", "[Of course!]", "Just before he lost his consciousness, Seol Jihu noticed that something came up to his face.", "[I am curious! I am dying to find out!]", "He could feel a giant hand-like thing cover his face.", "[He came up with the adorable notion of applying the Golden Commandment to the future.]", "[Will he be able to withstand the weight of the words he said\u2026?]", "Soon, a powerful energy brushed past his eyes.", "[You.
