{"cid": "122", "title": "Chapter 122. Timing Game (2)", "content": ["The sand fell down much quicker than Seol Jihu anticipated. No, it actually wasn\u2019t all that different from a normal hourglass. But because of the sudden turn of events, everything seemed more urgent.", "As the silence continued to stretch, everyone studied each other carefully. There wasn\u2019t a single person here who didn\u2019t understand the conditions. Every single one of them was on the lookout for any sort of change.", "A full minute went by as everyone stood idly. The sand had already fallen to the point where it was starting to be noticeable.", "\u201cDamn!\u201d", "\u201cFuck\u2026.\u201d", "All sorts of grunts flowed out. People\u2019s contorted faces distorted even further, to the point where they began to look like demons.", "The conditions were shitty enough by themselves, but there was even a time limit? Whoever created this stage had to be screwing with the participants on purpose. Otherwise, would they have needed to force the situation this much?", "In any case, about a tenth of the sand had already trickled down. In other words, they had to make some sort of a decision in the next nine minutes.", "Eventually, someone who wasn\u2019t able to stand the tension spoke up, \u201cEveryone go in!\u201d", "With a woman\u2019s shout as the starting point, the once silent plain became noisy.", "\u201cIt says at least six people need to enter. There is no limit on the number of people that can enter!\u201d", "The woman was suggesting that everyone work together to conquer the Plaza of Sacrifice. It was the fairest method given the situation they were in.", "However, this argument was only agreeable on the surface. It was difficult to expect all 166 people to come to an agreement with the same intention.", "\u201cMm\u2026. All of us going in is a bit\u2026.\u201d A man standing near the woman rubbed his chin. \u201cOnly six people need to go in to activate the plaza. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to pick six people to enter the left pit and have others enter the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish\u2026?\u201d", "The man's argument was also reasonable. However, it was too idealistic.", "\u201cThen how are you going to select the six people to enter the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d The man tried to say something but stopped and blinked repeatedly.", "The woman clenched her teeth with an irritated look. \u201c\u2026That\u2019s not all.\u201d Perhaps because of her clenched teeth, a suppressed voice rang out. \u201cWe know that the Plaza of Sacrifice has a \u2018static\u2019 difficulty, but we won\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a 1 or a 100 until someone goes in. Unless someone wants to volunteer, it\u2019s fair for everyone to go in.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cSo let\u2019s do that first. We\u2019ll need to confirm the difficulty before we can decide on anything.\u201d", "The man couldn\u2019t say anything at the woman\u2019s strong assertion. Although he found the idea difficult to swallow, he couldn\u2019t think of anything to say because the argument was logical.", "\u201cThen\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWe won\u2019t be going in.\u201d At that moment, another man spoke up. The woman frowned as she restlessly checked the hourglass.", "\u201cGod damn it\u2026. Can\u2019t you see that hourglass? We have to hurry!\u201d", "\u201cWhy would we go in when we don\u2019t have a reason to?\u201d", "When the man didn\u2019t back down and fought back, the woman became stunned.", "\u201cWhat? You say you don\u2019t have a reason to go in?\u201d", "\u201cYep. I and the three guys behind me came to quit after Stage 2 anyways.\u201d The man spoke with commanding confidence. \u201cThe four of us will return to Paradise after getting the Dissonant Wish. We\u2019re not interested in Stage 3 at all. The ones who are can fight or join hands or whatever. That\u2019s none of our concern.\u201d", "He looked around to the left and right, and his three comrades nodded their heads in agreement. Some people also pitched in, agreeing with the man\u2019s sentiment.", "The man wasn\u2019t wrong in thinking this way either. After all, people had their own reasons for participating in the Banquet.", "A vast majority of people wanted to get to Stage 3 to obtain the \u2018Harmonious Wish\u2019, but there were quite a few who knew their place and wanted to stop after Stage 2.", "As such, \u2018those who want to go to Stage 3 can work things out, and leave out the ones who want to quit after Stage 2,\u2019 was a valid argument.", "\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious.\u201d", "Only if Stage 2\u2019s exit was separate.", "Oh Rahee stared at the man who announced nonparticipation with a mocking smile.", "\u201cYou say that after reading the conditions\u2026. Are you boasting how retarded you are?\u201d", "Just like Oh Rahee pointed out, for the man\u2019s argument to stand, the exit to Paradise and Stage 3 had to be separate. In addition, there had to be a way to monitor which exit one took.", "The problem was that neither of these requirements was satisfied.", "[Stepping on the red portal on top of the altar will transport the challenger to Stage 3 or Paradise\u2026]", "\u2018Or\u2019 was the keyword. Since there was no way to tell where the participant would end up after stepping on the red portal, the people who were aiming to enter Stage 3 would never just sit by.", "\u201cInteresting. How did a brainless monkey like you pass Stage 1?\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you say!?\u201d", "Oh Rahee\u2019s unique, condescending manner of speech enraged the man who was speaking triumphantly.", "\u201cSay that again, you motherfucking whore\u2026.\u201d Muttering with a grim face, he attempted to create a hostile atmosphere. However\u2026.", "\u201cUuup!\u201d Oh Rahee moved like the wind and blocked the man\u2019s mouth with her left hand.", "\u201cWhore?\u201d", "\u201cUuuuup!\u201d", "She curled her fingers until the man\u2019s cheeks sunk in. Next, she slowly raised him into the air. A bizarre scene played out of a burly man being held up by a slender woman.", "\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re\u2014\u201d", "One of the man\u2019s comrades quickly took out his bow and arrow, but\u2026 Clang! He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence either.", "Oh Rahee\u2019s right hand moved like a bolt of lightning and sent his bow flying. The Archer who was about to nock his arrow stared at the longsword in her right hand and became stunned.", "Oh Rahee snorted as if she found them to be a joke before looking back up at the man in her left hand.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be shameless, be more subtle about it. Seeing you act so proud makes people angry.\u201d", "\u201cUuuuk!\u201d", "The man\u2019s struggling feet slowed down as if Oh Rahee\u2019s glaring eyes had drained him of all energy.", "\u201cDo you want to shut up and enter? Or do you want to think again after I break your chin?\u201d", "When she released a little bit of her strength, the man became relieved of the terrifying pressure and could finally breathe again. He coughed a few times before barely managing to collect his breath. With a face stained with fury, he opened his mouth, \u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "\u201cAh, whatever.\u201d Oh Rahee grinned. \u201cA beast that doesn\u2019t listen just needs to be beaten a few times.\u201d She grabbed his face again before stomping toward the Plaza of Sacrifice and extending her arm above the pit.", "\u201cGo in there and wait, little doggy.\u201d", "\u201cMmmp! Mmmmmp!\u201d", "\u201cYou sure know how to bark~\u201d", "The moment she let go, he would fall into the pit without a doubt. The man struggled desperately as if his life depended on it. However, Oh Rahee remained unmoving.", "Seol Jihu swallowed his saliva as he watched the man flail helplessly. Despite Oh Rahee going so far, no one stepped up to stop her. The man\u2019s comrades only watched in a daze, and others who previously agreed with the man fell silent.", "Oh Rahee couldn\u2019t be the strongest of the 166 people here. There had to be someone who could contend with her. But since there was no way an Earthling of such caliber wasn\u2019t aiming for Stage 3, not stopping Oh Rahee could be taken as a silent sign of agreement.", "\u2018Still\u2026.\u2019", "[Oh Rahee\u2019s Status Window]Summoned Date: 2015. 09. 18Marking Grade: BronzeSex/Age: Female/25Height/Weight: 168.8cm/54.2kgCurrent Condition: HealthyClass: Lv 5.

Other Abilities (2)", "After checking Oh Rahee\u2019s Status Window with the color of observation, he finally understood why she was so confident. Her physical stats and abilities were extraordinary. Seol Jihu was drawn to her Class Ability, Heart and Soul, the most.", "It seemed like an ability that couldn\u2019t be acquired through contribution points.", "\u2018Maybe, she is one of the \u2018true\u2019 High Rankers Master Jang mentioned.\u2019", "Seol Jihu realized just how great of a monster he worked with in Stage 1. It was then.", "\u201cPlease stop.\u201d", "As Oh Rahee was about to drop the man into the pit, a woman spoke up to stop her. She was a beautiful, blonde-haired woman wearing glasses that gave her a graceful, intelligent look.", "This was the first time Seol Jihu saw her, but his surroundings quickly buzzed with whispers. From what he could pick up, the blonde-haired woman was \u2018Evangeline Rose\u2019, a Grand Pathfinder just like Kazuki. In other words, she was a High Ranker.", "\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Oh Rahee asked with a face that seemed to ask, \u2018What retard is it now?\u2019 Despite Evangeline being a High Ranker, it seemed she had no interest in her.", "\u201cLet him go.\u201d Evangeline Rose spoke simply as if to avoid unnecessary fighting, \u201cWe will go in first.\u201d", "For a moment, Seol Jihu doubted his ears.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d It was the same with Oh Rahee. She tightened her grip on the man, whom she was about to drop.", "Evangeline Rose continued, \u201cI\u2019m not saying we will go in for free.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThe twelve of us will enter and scout the difficulty of the Plaza of Sacrifice. In exchange, we would like these two to enter the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish. Of course, they won\u2019t be coming back to Stage 2. They\u2019ll be leaving through the red portal.\u201d Hearing her clear, silvery voice, Seol Jihu realized her move was more calculated than altruistic.", "Reading her comrades\u2019 Status Windows with the color of observation, Seol Jihu found out that most of them were Level 4s, with the two who were left out being Level 2s.", "It seemed they were part of the same organization, having brought the weaker members as a way of getting experience. But now that the situation was heading in a bad direction, they seemed to want to send the low-leveled ones home.", "\u201cAnd what if they get sent to Stage 3?\u201d", "\u201cWell, they\u2019ll have to escape on their own. There\u2019s nothing we can do about that.\u201d", "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like something a worried mother would say.\u201d", "\u201cWe only know that ten people can enter Stage 3. There\u2019s nothing that says it\u2019s first-come-first-serve. Either there is a condition we don\u2019t know about or it\u2019s random. Regardless, we can\u2019t do anything about luck.\u201d", "When Oh Rahee asked in a provocative tone, Evangeline Rose struck back with calm.", "\u201cBesides, we\u2019re not saying we will use all of the six available slots. Since we\u2019re bearing the risk of being the first party to enter the Plaza of Sacrifice, wouldn\u2019t it be fair to give four of the six slots to us?\u201d She stealthily increased the slot they would take from two to four.", "\u201c\u2026Hnng.\u201d Oh Rahee hummed as though her interest had been piqued. She looked around the field, seemingly to check what the other spectators were thinking about. No one was voicing a word of complaint.", "Taking their silence as a sign of agreement, Oh Rahee smirked before looking back at the trembling man.", "\u201cThis is the correct way of being shameless. Watch and learn.\u201d", "She flung her arm, throwing the man away like a piece of trash. The man crashed on the ground and immediately crawled away from the pit in terror.", "\u2018She picked a good time,\u2019 Seol Jihu admired inwardly as he looked at the hourglass, which only had 3 or 4 minutes remaining.", "Evangeline Rose had used the fact that they were running out of time to offer a deal. It was only possible because the group currently lacked information.", "By entering the Plaza of Sacrifice first, thereby stopping the hourglass and obtaining information, they had succeeded in sending some of their comrades into the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish.", "Those left on the field would have to risk their chances of entering Stage 3, but they would gain information about the difficulty of the Plaza of Sacrifice without having to risk danger.", "In truth, Evangeline Rose\u2019s decision was a gamble and an adventure. Of course, she was a High Ranker, and judging by the equipment her comrades were wearing, they seemed to have ample experience. The team balance wasn\u2019t bad either.", "\u2018But wouldn\u2019t it be too dangerous with just twelve people\u2026?\u2019", "\u201cDoes anyone want to join us? You can also fit two people into the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish.\u201d Evangeline Rose seemed to agree to Seol Jihu as she raised her voice and asked.", "Seol Jihu glanced at Kazuki. He was watching silently, seemingly with no desire to volunteer. Seol Jihu expected as much from Kazuki. He was the type of person who never stepped forward unless he was certain.", "After a moment of continued murmuring, ten people volunteered additionally. The condition was the same. Eight of them would join the advance team while the other two would leave through the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish.", "Evangeline Rose seemed to think this was enough people as she nodded her head. Filling all six spots for the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish would cause more headaches, and there wasn\u2019t enough time remaining anyways.", "Thus, the twenty-person advance team disappeared into the left hole. When no one else entered for a few seconds, the Plaza of Sacrifice must have thought that was it.", "Koong! The entrance closed shut with a loud thud.", "Soon, the closed pit on the right opened up. The four people who were given the opportunity to leave hesitated for a moment before noticing dozens of gazes on them and hurriedly disappearing into the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish.", "There were spots left. Two people could still enter the right pit.", "However, no one dared to move. The man who was threatened by Oh Rahee was still shivering in fear, showing everyone what would happen if they acted on their own.", "Soon, the sand finished trickling down, and the hourglass flipped over.", "After quietly watching the first ten minutes play out, Seol Jihu thought Evangeline Rose\u2019s method wasn\u2019t so bad. As no one in his temporary alliance was weak to the point of needing to be sent back, that only gave them a greater edge in picking out potential teams to cooperate with.", "The problem was finding a trustworthy team. However, this problem caused little to no trouble.", "\u2018The Triads\u2026 and there was another team, right?\u2019", "The other two organizations Kazuki allied with were coming in handy. But in any case, confirming the difficulty of the Plaza of Sacrifice was the top priority.", "\u2018Since six was the minimum number of challengers\u2026. Twenty should be more than enough, right?\u2019", "Although he thought this, it was nothing more than an assumption. Just because the monsters in Stage 1 were weak, it didn\u2019t mean that monsters in Stage 2 also had to be weak.", "\u2018The Golden Rule.\u2019", "Seol Jihu stared at the two pits emitting a reddish-golden light and quietly waited for the advance team to emerge.", "*", "How much time went by?", "It felt like several tens of minutes had already passed. Just as the people standing around waiting were beginning to get bored\u2026", "Koong! The sound of a door opening finally rang out, followed by a closing sound. The Plaza of the Dissonant Wish had been shut down the moment the Plaza of Sacrifice opened up.", "The crowd had been standing away from the pits to avoid being misunderstood. But when they sensed this change, they hurriedly gathered around the left pit.", "Seol Jihu followed Kazuki and slowly walked forward. Everyone waited for the advance team to come up. However\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t they coming up?\u201d", "The door had opened, but the advance team didn\u2019t emerge no matter how long they waited.", "\u201cMaybe they\u2019re severely injured and can\u2019t jump up?\u201d", "Someone made a suggestion, while another cusped their hands over their mouth and yelled. However, only a vacant echo resounded.", "Just as a shadow of apprehension and nervousness was cast over everyone\u2019s faces\u2026.", "\u201cAhhh!\u201d", "Someone\u2019s index finger that was pointing at the pit quickly went up.", "Something had suddenly shot up from the pit. The thing that looked like a human body drew an arc in the air before crashing down on the field. That wasn\u2019t all. The pit continued to spit things out, almost as if it was coughing out food that was stuck in its throat.", "Tk! Roll\u2026!", "Something round with fluttering hair rolled on the ground and stopped in front of Seol Jihu\u2019s foot. When he subconsciously looked down, he couldn\u2019t help but gasp in shock.", "After all\u2026.", "\u201cC-Corpses\u2014!\u201d", "What he saw was a severely damaged head.", "\u2018Evangeline Rose?\u2019", "Just what had happened? Her long, silky hair was cut sparsely, and its previously dazzling, blonde color was dyed crimson. Not only that, more than half of her tall nose was shaved off, and her intelligent, sagacious eyes gone as if they had been dug out.", "Looking at the tears of blood flowing down from her eye sockets, Seol Jihu groaned inwardly.", "\u2018Her neck\u2026.\u2019", "Her neck was twisted and cut off like a churro. Judging by her distorted expression and crumpled mouth that revealed her uvula, he could tell how much she had struggled in pain before she died.", "Ssssss-! Then, when sand began to trickle down from the stopped hourglass, everyone became stunned.", "The advance team had returned as viciously damaged corpses.", "The hourglass\u2019s sand had begun to fall once again.", "It was very clear what these two phenomena were suggesting.", "[Exit automatically opened once all enemies eliminated or no challengers remain.]", "All twenty members of the advance team had died in the Plaza of Sacrifice.", "In other words\u2026.", "\u2018But they had a High Ranker\u2026!\u2019", "The remaining 142 people had started off with the worst possible move."]}
