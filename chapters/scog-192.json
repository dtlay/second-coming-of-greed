But because it sounded like she was asking, \u2018You had an ulterior motive, right?\u2019, Seol Jihu stammered like a kid who got caught red-handed.", "He then remembered the heavy bags in his hands and found a suitable excuse.", "\u201cActually, I came to give you this.\u201d", "Seol Jihu put the bags down and took out the gift for Seo Yuhui. Once he politely handed it to her, she immediately fixed her gaze on the shopping bags.", "\u201cOh, wow\u2026.\u201d", "Was she not expecting a present?

Oh, my.\u201d Acting flustered and at a loss for what to do, she only received the present when Seol Jihu convinced her.", "\u201cWhat should I do? I didn\u2019t prepare anything\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not expecting anything back.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu waved his hands, Seo Yuhui looked sorrier than before, and her eyes wavered slightly.", "\u201cThis is just too sudden. If I knew, I would have gone back to Earth to bring you something.\u201d", "She even wiped her glistening eyes with her finger. She looked like she was profoundly moved, like a mother who just received the first present from her son.", "\u2018As I thought, they\u2019re not the same person.\u2019", "Seol Jihu nodded his head.", "\u201cWhat is it? Can I open it now?\u201d", "And then when Seo Yuhui looked inside the shopping bag and asked curiously, he shook his head strongly.", "\u201cNo, take your time with it.

That makes me even more curious.\u201d", "\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to hurry up and leave.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu began to pick up the bags he put down, Seo Yuhui narrowed her eyes suspiciously.", "\u201cWhy? We can\u2019t look at it together?\u201d", "\u201cEii, of course not. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d", "With that, Seol Jihu turned around saying, \u201cSorry for causing a scene.\u201d", "\u2018It\u2019s a good thing I prepared this gift.\u2019", "The happier the receiver was, the happier the gifter got. While Seol Jihu left to avoid being embarrassed, he was secretly confident in his gift. He had no doubt that Seo Yuhui would love the gift and use it well.", "After all, it was a necessary item for daily life and also a gift that had never failed him before. Plus, it was also the only present he was praised for while he was happily dating Yoo Seonhwa.

Then again, how could she not be happy with a surprise gift?", "\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d", "Pledging to invite him to dinner and treat him to a sumptuous feast, Seo Yuhui went back inside and closed the door.", "\u2018I wonder what it is.\u2019", "Enjoying the beating of her fluttering heart, she opened the box excitedly.

And so expecting the office to be empty, he almost screamed the moment he opened the office door and went in.", "Jang Maldong was sitting on the couch, looking at him with a solemn look.", "\u201cYou came back in exactly seven days.\u201d", "\u201cW-When did you get here?\u201d", "\u201cFour days ago.\u201d", "\u201cFour days ago\u2026? That was really quick. You should have rested a bit more.\u201d", "Jang Maldong put on an odd expression. He asked, feeling unsure.", "\u201cOh yeah? Then why don\u2019t we go back together? We can stay there for a month.\u201d", "\u201cA month? I might be able to do two weeks, but a month is too much.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed, telling him not to joke around too much. Jang Maldong stared at the chuckling young man before crossing his arms and nodding his head.", "Sending Seol Jihu home the moment he was discharged from the temple was mostly for his benefit, but it was also for the team\u2019s benefit.", "While Seol Jihu took the role because they couldn\u2019t find anyone else who was suitable, Seol Jihu was, unequivocally, the leader of Carpe Diem.", "And with the last war, he solidified his position completely. Never mind his team members, not even the team advisor, Jang Maldong, could easily mess with his authority. Of course, he didn\u2019t plan to mess with it if he could help it. The point was that the leader determined the color and the atmosphere of a team.", "If Seol Jihu, who was the nucleus of Carpe Diem, was overly serious and focused, the burden his teammates felt would increase as well.", "As the team had just completed a major event successfully, a change of pace was needed. That was why Jang Maldong had forced Seol Jihu into going back, and it seemed more effective than he had thought it would be.", "The proof was \u2018two weeks is a bit too much\u2019 changing to \u2018I might be able to do two weeks.\u2019", "\u2018Now this is a bit more acceptable.\u2019", "Just as Jang Maldong leaned on the back of the couch with a relieved look\u2026", "\u201cMaster!\u201d", "\u201cHm?\u201d", "A large shopping bag popped into his view.

It\u2019s your present, of course.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled brightly and gently put the gift down on Jang Maldong\u2019s lap.", "\u201cI heard from Seol-Ah. Though it\u2019s a bit late, thank you for saving me.\u201d", "\u201cNo\u2026 you\u2019re the one who\u2019s had it rough.\u201d", "Jang Maldong let out a dry cough and turned his gaze.", "\u201cWhy did you bring something like this? You\u2019re making me embarrassed.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be embarrassed about? Just think of it as a gift from a grandson.\u201d", "\u201cOh, please, grandson? That\u2019s gross. Shoo.\u201d", "He said this apathetically and then moved the shopping bag to the side, but Seol Jihu didn\u2019t miss the corner of Jang Maldong\u2019s mouth wiggling. The way his face stretched horizontally\u2014 he was very clearly smiling.", "\u201cAnyways, I need to talk to you about your body and your direction of growth.\u201d", "Jang Maldong suddenly changed the topic. He was clearly embarrassed and trying to change the subject, so Seol Jihu restrained his laughter.", "\u201cI want to hear your thoughts first.\u201d", "\u201cAh, yes, here it is.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took out a notebook from his bag and handed it to Jang Maldong. Seeing the densely written words in the notebook, Jang Maldong\u2019s eyebrows wiggled.", "Silence fell for some time. Flip, flip. Only the sound of pages being turned resounded.", "\u2018This brat.\u2019", "Jang Maldong glanced at Seol Jihu, who was staring back with a nervous face, then shifted his gaze back down to the notebook.", "How to grow in the future and the reasons to do so were written down in the notebook in minute detail, without missing a single thing. The problem was that it was too detailed.", "Seol Jihu had revealed his intentions so clearly and openly that Jang Maldong was a bit taken aback while reading. While it wasn\u2019t such a bad feeling to be trusted so much, he had to do what he needed to.", "Tak. Cramming the content of the notebook in his head, Jang Maldong closed the notebook and ripped it to shreds.", "\u201cYou fool. What if someone gets their hands on this notebook? Have you not learned about protecting your Status Window privacy?\u201d", "\u201cI planned to burn it after showing it to you.\u201d", "\u201cGo burn it. Now.\u201d", "Jang Maldong handed him the chopped up pieces of paper. While Seol Jihu went to burn them, Jang Maldong organized his thoughts. He started speaking once Seol Jihu came back.", "\u201cYou seem to be in a hurry.\u201d", "Seol Jihu remained calm. He didn\u2019t affirm or deny Jang Maldong\u2019s statement, but his silence meant his answer was closer to the former.", "While he had written a detailed note, it was rather easy to summarize it.", "First, he would have to restore his lowered physical stats. Then after leveling up in the temple, he would use the Divine Elixirs and Ability Points to balance his mind, body, and technique as much as possible. Finally, he would offer the Divine Stigmata to receive a Divine Vestige.", "It was the quickest way to getting stronger in the shortest amount of time.", "Jang Maldong understood where he was coming from. After meeting the Army Commanders in a huge war, it was no surprise that Seol Jihu would want to get stronger as soon as possible.", "He did not have even an inkling in his mind to criticize his plan as foolish.", "After all, he must have come to this decision after what he experienced and felt during the previous despair-filled war.", "There was just one thing\u2026.", "\u201cYou understand that you will suffer significant losses with this choice, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes, and I plan to bear the burden of that loss.\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied seriously. There was no longer any sign of laughter in his voice.", "Jang Maldong sighed, then spoke.", "\u201cI\u2019ll be honest. Reading this note, it feels more like a desperate struggle to correct your distorted mind, body, and technique, rather than a plan for proper growth.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips when Jang Maldong correctly pointed out his intention.", "He did not regret putting all of his Ability Points into Mana. After all, he was in a situation where he had no choice but to do so. This was also why Jang Maldong didn\u2019t criticize him for making such a rash choice.", "But that didn\u2019t mean the problem at hand was magically gone.", "\u201cI can\u2019t help but think that it\u2019s a bit of a shame. No, not a bit, but a lot.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cFrankly speaking, it\u2019s because of the effect of the Divine Elixir. You should know it better than anyone else.\u201d", "Seol Jihu quietly nodded his head.", "Divine Elixir \u2014 an extraordinary elixir that instantly increases a physical level by one rank.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s current Stamina stat appeared as Intermediate (High). Here, the \u2018Intermediate\u2019 part referred to the rank and the \u2018High\u2019 part referred to the stage.", "This was what Jang Maldong was pointing out.", "Taking the Divine Elixir at Intermediate (High) would increase his physical stat to High (Low), and taking it at Intermediate (Low) would likewise increase it to High (Low).", "In the case of the former, it would be losing out on two whole stages. In terms of Ability Points, the loss would be greater, the higher-ranked the stat was.", "\u201cI understand, but\u2014\u201d", "Seol Jihu continued quietly.", "\u201cAt my current state, I don\u2019t have the confidence to increase my physical level with just training. Of course, if I put my life on the line to put in effort, it might be possible to increase it by one or two stages. But I can\u2019t begin to think just how long that will take.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s plan was reasonable given the current situation. However\u2026", "\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to tell you.\u201d", "Jang Maldong argued back immediately.", "\u201cDo not underestimate what you\u2019ve accomplished. I\u2019m not just talking about killing Undying Diligence. Three of the Seven Armies suffered near-annihilation, and the Nosferatus lost their ability to regenerate.", "\u201cUnsightly Humility was forced to use Divinity Manifestation, and the Federation recaptured Tigol Fortress, which the Parasite Queen spent painstaking efforts to conquer.", "\u201cThe Federation is supposedly brimming with determination to never lose it again, focusing all their efforts on reconstructing the fortress.", "\u201cThe Parasites also stopped their advances for the first time and went on the defensive. What do you think is your greatest gain from all of this?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head in a daze.", "\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d", "But the moment he heard this\u2014 Ian\u2019s final words flashed across his mind.", "[So\u2026 run!]", "[I know it\u2019s hard. I know you don\u2019t want to. But you have to endure it. No matter what, run away\u2026 and live! That is the only piece of victory and hope we can recover from this war.]", "Seol Jihu interlocked his fingers and closed his eyes. A stream of doubt descended on his fair complexion.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Time is one thing\u2026 but I don\u2019t know if I have any more hidden potential\u2026.\u201d", "He still sounded diffident. In a way, it was an accurate diagnosis. After all, he should know the state of his body better than anyone else.", "It wasn\u2019t as if Jang Maldong didn\u2019t understand this, but he cupped his chin on his hand and curled the corner of his mouth up.", "\u201cWhat if you do?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cAh, my bad. I shouldn\u2019t have put it that way. What if your body\u2019s hidden potential increased since the war?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes shot open. For some reason, he remembered the densely packed needles that were sticking out of his body when he woke up from his coma.", "\u2018In that case\u2026\u2019", "It was a different story.", "Jang Maldong spun his cane.", "\u201cUsing the Divine Elixirs and Ability Points at Level 5\u2026 I agree and empathize with this decision fully. While we may have bought time, it doesn\u2019t mean we have an infinite amount of it. It may be better to get stronger while you can.\u201d", "\u201cRight.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d", "Jang Maldong suddenly gripped the cane hard.", "\u201cWhat if we change the order around a bit? You have precious treasures you may never be able to acquire again, so shouldn\u2019t you at least try to use them without any wastage?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head, unwittingly convinced by Jang Maldong. Although a small seed of doubt still remained in his heart, if what Jang Maldong was saying was true\u2026 if he could raise his Strength, Endurance, Agility, and Stamina stats to High (Low)\u2026", "\u2018And if I used the Divine Elixirs then\u2026.\u201d", "Pinnacle![1]", "For the first time since he entered Paradise, his physical stats may overpower his mana!", "That wasn\u2019t all.", "[I see. So that\u2019s what comes after Pinnacle\u2026.]", "As he had two Stamina Divine Elixirs, he could even aim for the rank after Pinnacle.", "Feeling like a fog had suddenly been lifted off his head, Seol Jihu looked straight at Jang Maldong.", "\u201cIs it possible?\u201d", "\u201cOf course! If you want, I will modify this plan of yours to the best of my abilities.\u201d", "Seol Jihu realized his question was pointless. Given Jang Maldong\u2019s personality, he wouldn\u2019t have promised him a rosy future if it wasn\u2019t possible. He must have mentioned it because it was!", "\u201cI promise. I will ensure you do not waste even a single one of your Divine Elixirs and Ability Points.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not forcing you, of course. But since we have time, I\u2019m suggesting we postpone using the Divine Elixirs and Ability Points.\u201d", "Saying this, Jang Maldong gave a meaningful smile. It was then\u2014", "\u201cHow about it? We can talk again after you come back from the temple\u2014\u201d", "Jang Maldong suddenly turned his gaze in the middle of talking. Seol Jihu, who was listening attentively, also turned to look at the door.", "1. Taking suggestions. Peak High, High (Peak), Highest, etc. The word has been used before (in various contexts) and has generally been translated as \u2018highest\u2019, so I will be keeping it this way for now.
