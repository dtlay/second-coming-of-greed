But\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThe black mage failed her experiment, but she didn\u2019t give up on it entirely. Just before she perished, she transferred the energy of black magic to her five devotees, promising to meet again in the future. She planned on improving her experiment using what she learned from her failure.\u201d", "Phi Sora spoke quickly, perhaps because they did not have much time on their hands.", "\u201cIn short, the ultimate goal of the Sixth Mother was her own resurrection. Her ambition went beyond freeing her soul. She planned to create a body that could carry both types of energies, and then transfer her soul into that body.\u201d", "Seol Jihu felt dazed.

He had assumed that the black mage\u2019s wish was to set her soul free. However, as it turned out, the real objective had been elsewhere.", "\u201cOf course, the conditions for the resurrection are not easy to meet. First, you\u2019d need an Essence of Soma and the Absolute Evil, each representing one end of the conflicting energies. Then, the soul of the black mage, who will serve as a mediator controlling both energies inside the new body, would have to be freed.\u201d", "\u201cAbsolute Evil?\u201d", "\u201cThe killers.

They became linked to each other when they received the black mage\u2019s energy. What this means is that they, too, are nothing more than sacrifices that would eventually be used to resurrect the Sixth Mother.\u201d", "So, the reason the remaining killers became stronger each time one of their own died was because the energy that had been divided into five pieces became closer to the whole.", "After hearing the explanation, Seol Jihu finally realized why the Sixth Mother had thanked him.", "\u201cYou\u2019re saying that killing the killers is part of the process of completing the offering.\u201d", "\u201cYes.

The one about the Homunculus gaining intelligence and a sense of self.\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked his eyes.", "\u201cThe Homunculus was born without a soul. But if it takes in the sacrifices not all at once but slowly, one at a time, it can absorb the energy of the Sixth Mother as its own and gain the ability to think independently.

It\u2019s a miscalculation on her part.\u201d", "\u201cBut the Diary of an Unknown Survival hinted that we shouldn\u2019t feed the killers to the Homunculus.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s also correct. If the Homunculus gained more than three pieces of energy, it would have broken out of the dungeon. Then, it would have tried to devour everything in its path, be it the killers, the survivors, or the Sixth Mother.\u201d", "Having finished her explanation, Phi Sora looked down at her phone nervously.

It was then that Seol Jihu realized the mistake he had made.", "\u2018So this is what Attention Required meant\u2026.\u2019", "The special tutorial contained a huge secret that was simply beyond his imagination.", "Seol Jihu thought he was being reasonable, but it turned out he had been making decisions based on only small parts of the tutorial.", "\u201cI have one more question.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said.", "\u201cWhy did the Homunculus enter a rampaging state?\u201d", "\u201cBecause it failed to meet the conditions.\u201d", "Phi Sora answered quickly.", "\u201cIts body was made to contain opposite energies. But in this case, only half of those energies came in, and all at once too. So the Homunculus couldn\u2019t properly digest the sudden surge of energy. And because the Sixth Mother\u2019s soul isn\u2019t there to control the energy, it\u2019s natural for the Homunculus to go wild.\u201d", "Then Phi Sora continued in a somewhat feeble voice.", "\u201cThough\u2026 in this case, it did so on purpose to get back at you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu closed his eyes.", "A mess. Everything was a huge mess. He felt wronged, of course. The Tutorial was simply too complicated.", "Seol Jihu was no Sherlock Holmes. It was virtually impossible for him to figure out the entire plot with such limited information. But he also knew this was an excuse. Looking back now, he could see that, though scarce, the hints were definitely there.", "[What is the Sixth Mother\u2019s goal?]", "There was at least one hint in the Diary of an Unknown Survivor. He did think it was strange there were so many pages in the diary. Had he taken the time to collect all the pages and proceeded with caution, he might have seen through the Sixth Mother\u2019s plans.", "Instead, he rushed and consequently failed. The noise inside his head was getting louder, but Seol Jihu defeated it with a shake of his head.", "In any case, what was done was done. He knew his priority should be solving the problem at hand.", "\u201cTo think that\u2026 of all the options, you\u2019d choose the worst\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora sighed. Their conversation came to a halt. As the silence prolonged, the survivors\u2019 faces began to fall. They could see that both the Guide and the Invited were upset.", "\u201cW-Wait.\u201d", "Giving in to the pressure, one of the survivors finally raised his hand and asked.", "\u201cSo we have to find the coins or whatever to open the portal? Here, right now?\u201d", "\u201cYes. For the record, there are 6000 hidden coins. Though, that covers the entire island.\u201d", "\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant. I meant that\u2026 well, from what I heard, it seems there\u2019s a scary monster on the way\u2026.\u201d", "He mumbled and looked at Seol Jihu. Phi Sora raised her eyebrows slightly.", "\u201cYou\u2019re blaming this man?\u201d", "A look of disdain quickly crossed Phi Sora\u2019s face. She knew he was one of the survivors Seol Jihu rescued. She couldn\u2019t believe he was still looking for someone to blame, so much that she started to question his motives.", "\u201cNow that\u2019s too much!\u201d", "Park Woori raised his voice.", "\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019d be dead anyway if it wasn\u2019t for Hyung-nim! \u2018Let\u2019s do this together.

I just\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNot me.\u201d", "As the man shrugged nervously, a sharp voice interrupted their conversation. It was from the same woman who argued with the young man at the empty lot. She looked at Seol Jihu and Park Woori with eyes full of discontent.", "\u201cI haven\u2019t received any help from the Invited over there. I made it here on my own.\u201d", "She didn\u2019t say much, but it was clear from the tone of her voice that she was pinning the blame on Seol Jihu and demanding him to take care of the mess that he had created.", "\u201cAll of you, shut up.\u201d", "It was then that Phi Sora raised her voice.", "\u201cI did warn you not to point fingers at others.\u201d", "The tone of her voice was quite serious.

The woman flinched when her eyes met Phi Sora\u2019s threatening gaze.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would need to say this, but\u2014 do you really think you survived all on your own? If this man hadn\u2019t distracted the killers, you would have died long before you reached the end of the bridge. Are you aware of this?\u201d", "At this, the woman\u2019s face hardened. Her lips tightened but her expression remained vexed, and one could tell she wasn\u2019t persuaded. Phi Sora took a deep breath and calmed herself.

The reason was simple. They knew the Invited was the monster\u2019s first target and planned to get as far away from him as possible.", "Not long after, only four people remained. Seol Jihu remained silent. With his eyes closed tightly, he seemed lost in thought.", "Koong\u2026 Koong\u2026", "Meanwhile, the thumping sound grew louder.", "\u201cH-Hyung-nim\u2026.\u201d", "Park Woori looked at the bridge, then at Seol Jihu, and pressed carefully.

We never approached the Tutorial for the purpose that it was designed for.\"", "Everything worked in a certain way. Of course, one didn\u2019t always have to play by the rules. In some instances, one could gain more by defying standard tactics.", "But doing so always carried the risk of aggravating the situation. And this wasn\u2019t the first time Seol Jihu overcame obstacles through creative means.", "He did so at the Forest of Denial, during the Arden Valley Baiting Operation, and then again during the Delphinion Laboratory Rescue Mission.", "None of them were easy. The results were all good, but even the slightest mistake could have resulted in his death.", "But fortunately, Seol Jihu had never failed before. And as a result, he developed a certain \u2018habit\u2019. This habit forced him to look for an easy way out whenever he came face to face with a problem, rather than following the standard procedure.", "Some might call him clever; others would mark him as impatient.", "This habit of his came in handy during emergencies, but it became a weakness when he was in a situation where he had to patiently follow standard measures.It was simple, really.", "Seol Jihu had approached the Tutorial in the same way he had approached other problems.", "It was just that this time, he didn\u2019t get the same good results as before. The way he saw it, the time bomb that had been ticking for a while now had finally gone off.", "But there was a way to fix this.

I think\u2014 no, I\u2019m sure the Seven Gods have prepared a solution. And I believe you, Miss Eun Yuri, will be able to find it.\u201d", "Still, Eun Yuri continued to fidget with the paper, reluctant to let go.
