We cannot repeat the same mistake.]", "Sending three armies in a hurry to the valley turned out to be a serious blunder.", "It wasn\u2019t just the loss of military force that hurt. What made the Parasite Queen most bitter was that the invasion had facilitated the dead Star\u2019s revival and had even hastened its growth.", "As a result, a substantial part of the future that the Parasite Queen was drawing had fallen into utter chaos.", "\u201cAre you saying you will wait and see how things turn out?\u201d", "[I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t do anything.]", "The Parasite Queen smirked faintly.", "[Lust and Gluttony seem to have made many preparations.

It might take even longer than that.\u201d", "With that, Kim Hannah gestured at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cYou said so yourself, right? That you became a Level 5, but didn\u2019t acquire any skills befitting one.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head. It was true that he had not paid attention to training since he leveled up.", "\u201cIf the frightening strength you displayed during the war was the result of relying on Awakening skills, raising your true strength should be your top priority. At the very least, you need to get 4 or 5 times stronger than you are now.\u201d", "\u201cThat much?\u201d", "\u201cProper High Rankers are usually at least that strong.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu thought about Phi Sora, who was supposedly the top 0.01 percent of Level 5 Warriors, he quickly acquiesced.", "\u201cWe\u2019re moving to Eva, but we don\u2019t know how the established organizations there will react. No, considering your goals, we will clash with them without a doubt. When that happens, strength is the only thing we can rely on.\u201d", "This was something Sorg K\u00fchne touched upon as well.", "In the worst-case scenario, there was a chance Carpe Diem would go to war with another organization.", "He had been waiting to train anyway. And since the Parasites could invade again at any time, training constantly was only natural.", "Seol Jihu happily nodded his head.", "\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come back far stronger than I am now. Wait for me.\u201d", "\u201cHey, if you put it like that, it sounds like we\u2019re the main couple of a drama who has no choice but to say goodbye.\u201d", "Kim Hannah scolded him while giggling.", "Just like that, they decided to split the team into two.", "Kim Hannah would go to Eva, and Chohong and Marcel Ghionea would go with her. Given how many enemies Kim Hannah had, she needed someone to protect her, and having one High Ranker Warrior and the Archer of Steel with her made Seol Jihu feel at ease.", "Jang Maldong, of course, was going with Seol Jihu to train. There was no need to even mention Flone.", "As for the rest, Seol Jihu decided they could do what they wanted.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go train too.\u201d", "Yi Sungjin was the first to raise his hand.", "\u201cMe too.\u201d", "And Hugo surprisingly took it upon himself as well.", "\u201cI understand Sungjin wanting to come, but you too?\u201d", "\u201cYeah.

Anyway, we need your help.\u201d", "Hearing this, Phi Sora closed her mouth. The way she kept glancing at Seol Jihu, she definitely knew something about the upcoming training.", "Jang Maldong ignored her sideways glances and continued.", "\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d", "\u201cUm, I\u2026\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah spoke carefully while rolling her eyes.", "\u201cI want to go to Eva\u2026 I\u2019m curious to know what the place is like\u2026\u201d", "\u201cGo ahead.
