It was an isolated space created for the purpose of testing Earthlings.", "What caught Seol Jihu\u2019s attention was its flow of time. Time flowed ten times faster in this world than in Paradise. Meaning, ten days in this space were equal to a single day in Paradise.", "Seol Jihu used his last Divine Wish in using the Path of the Soul as a training ground. Given the vastness of the place and the number of people that would enter it, there were many things he had to leave out to make this possible.", "First, the rewards one could get by passing the trials were all removed. Even if a participant were to reach the summit with their own strength, they would not be able to receive the Godslaying Authority.", "There was also no need to eat or drink in the Path of the Soul, but this effect was removed as well. After all, food could be brought in from the outside.", "Moreover, as the purpose of using the Path of the Soul was to train and not test, Seol Jihu\u2019s intention wasn\u2019t to drive everyone\u2019s body to the limit. Jang Maldong always said eating and resting well was also a part of training after all.", "\u201cEuuuuh!\u201d", "Phi Sora revived at the starting point after dying again. She glared at the mountain with a look of frustration. Currently, there were six, seven others training there.", "Chohong and Hugo were pushing boulders up the first slope, and Yi Sungjin was blocking the boulders that rolled down with his shield on the second slope.", "Of course, like Teresa, some weren\u2019t going up the slopes but were practicing the Grand Cosmic Shift, which Seol Jihu taught.", "\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d", "Phi Sora furrowed her brows as she looked at Yi Seol-Ah, who was running around with Aura on the second slope, having fun dodging the boulders that rolled down.", "\u201cI know there are differences between Warriors and Archers, but how\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThe Path of the Soul doesn\u2019t affect everyone the same way.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke calmly.", "\u201cThe condition of the person taking the trial is what determines it.

They must have higher Strength stat than Miss Phi Sora, but they\u2019re still working on pushing their boulders up, right?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s because we don\u2019t need to go through all of the slopes\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora pouted, but it wasn\u2019t as if she didn\u2019t understand. Soon, she sighed and glanced at Seol Jihu.", "\u201c\u2026Were you really in this place for seven years?\u201d", "\u201cYep. But you don\u2019t need to do it like me. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t take that long anyway.\u201d", "\u201cDear, thanks for believing in me, but can\u2019t you give me more realistic advice or something? You know, like I did this, I did that.\u201d", "Seol Jihu made a troubled expression. After observing for the past few days, he already noticed Phi Sora\u2019s weakness. She was a near-flawless all-arounder as the leader of a charge, but she lacked agility.", "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything? Can\u2019t you tell me a thing or two?\u201d", "It was then.", "\u201cShould I tell you?\u201d", "A snarky voice cut in. A man clad in black armor was walking in from the left. He looked like a total delinquent the way he bit off chunks of meat from a skewer.", "\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026.\u201d", "It was Black Seol Jihu.", "None of Valhalla\u2019s members were shocked to see him, only a little startled. It was because Seol Jihu had told them about him before they entered the Path of Soul.", "Although Black Seol Jihu was really a manifestation of Future Vision, everyone knew him as a helper arranged by Gula for the trials. The problem was, no one was attempting to get his help.", "\u201cThat\u2019s enough whining. You\u2019re the one who can\u2019t do it. What do you want him to do about it?\u201d", "\u201cWhat was that? Whining?\u201d", "\u201cYes, whining. What else would you call it? Listen, why do you think you can\u2019t climb the second slope even though you have a basic understanding of Grand Cosmic Shift? Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know. Your agility is already bad, and your reaction speed is generally slow.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu spoke snarkily with a beaming smile.", "\u201cHow can your legs move fast when your body is slow to react? If I were you, I would focus on dodging and raise my ability to react to quick changes. In fact, I would set everything else aside and do that.

Do you think you can learn Ethereal Shift by just running like a brainless bull? Hmm?\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu shrugged.", "\u201cIf you think I\u2019m criticizing you unfairly, keep at it. I\u2019ve actually seen one guy do that. He just ran day in and day out until he finally mastered it. If it\u2019s you, I\u2019m sure it will only take you two years of non-stop running.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re so amazing, huh?\u201d", "Phi Sora glared. She couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with what Black Seol Jihu said, but his tone was simply too provocative.", "\u201cYeah, I\u2019m amazing. I can say this since I\u2019m more amazing than you.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu was unfazed and continued to be snarky.", "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to take my advice or throw it out. And if you\u2019re unhappy with me\u2026 you know what to do, right?\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu pointed at the spear hanging on his back. Phi Sora grunted. She wanted to beat him to a pummel, but\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "She didn\u2019t dare to start a fight. It was because, on the first day, she saw Hugo get killed dozens of times after reacting strongly to his sour remark, \u2018A dog who can\u2019t understand needs to be taught with a stick.\u2019", "\u201c\u2026How very humble.\u201d", "Phi Sora spat on the ground and turned around. Black Seol Jihu chuckled.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of temper for someone who\u2019s going to be saying, yes, honey~ in the future.\u201d", "\u201cFuck off!\u201d", "Phi Sora shouted as she ran up the slope. She looked like she was about to break out into tears.", "\u2018I knew this would happen.\u2019", "Seol Jihu sighed.", "\u201c\u2026What are you eating?\u201d", "\u201cThis? Fried chicken on a skewer.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu put out a plate of chicken skewers as he bit another one off a stick.", "\u201cHaeju brought it. You should try one too. It\u2019s crunchy, and the flavor is out of this world.\u201d", "\u201cCome over here for a bit.\u201d", "\u201cW-What\u2019s wrong?\u201d", "Seol Jihu dragged Black Seol Jihu to an empty spot and spoke quietly.", "\u201cCan\u2019t you be a little nicer?\u201d", "\u201cNicer? I\u2019m already pretty nice. Don\u2019t you remember what I said when you were in their spot?\u201d", "\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t in the same situation as them. Besides, the training only just started, so they haven\u2019t gotten used to it yet. You have to be mindful of that.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I said anything wrong. Besides, that Sora needs this kind of criticism. Otherwise, she won\u2019t get fired up and try harder.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2026 haa, never mind. Just don\u2019t make fun of them. Honey was stretching it.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Did you think I was kidding?\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu\u2019s voice suddenly sunk. Seol Jihu jumped in a startle. Black Seol Jihu emptied the plate before Seol Jihu noticed and was putting a cigarette in his mouth. He looked somber all of a sudden, like he aged by ten years.", "\u201c\u2026Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d", "\u201cCigarette\u2026 didn\u2019t you tell me to quit?\u201d", "\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m smoking?\u201d", "Like the saying, getting angry at others for your own mistake, Black Seol Jihu got mad.", "\u201cFuck, I can\u2019t even curse you out because it would be like spitting at my own face. I\u2019m thankful that the future changed, but the result\u2026 just how\u2026.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu sighed uncharacteristically and dropped his head.", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "According to Black Seol Jihu, they were like different compartments of a single train. Meaning, the choices Seol Jihu made would affect the future of Black Seol Jihu.", "Of course, as Black Seol Jihu was a manifestation of the \u2018future\u2019, his body remained the same as his original future self. It did not reflect the choices Seol Jihu made in the present time. Even so, he was still capable of finding out how the future changed.", "\u201cDid\u2026 did something bad happen?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu asked carefully, Black Seol Jihu raised his eyebrow.", "\u201cYou.\u201d", "Then, he spoke.", "\u201cBe careful with this.\u201d", "He tapped Seol Jihu\u2019s crotch with the spear shaft. Seol Jihu stepped back, asking what was wrong.", "\u201cFor Yan[1], Squishy, and Miss Pink\u2026 Fine, they came at you determined, so let\u2019s say it was inevitable. Knowing you, there probably wasn\u2019t a way to escape anyway.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Who?\u201d", "\u201cAnd then there\u2019s win-in-daytime, lose-in-nighttime[2] Hannah and Miss Pervert\u2026 but let\u2019s set them aside too.\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t make sense of what Black Seol Jihu was saying.", "\u201cBut you\u2019re no saint either.

Just how did things turn out that way?\u201d", "It was at that moment that Black Seol Jihu went beyond being incensed and straight-up glared at Seol Jihu with a fiery gaze. He looked furious but also frustrated because he couldn\u2019t say anything in detail.", "\u201c\u2026Bro.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu lowered his voice and growled.", "\u201cYou\u2019re the real problem here. Why are you like this?\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cWhat? What? Haa. I wouldn\u2019t be saying this if it only happened once or twice. You go with someone without knowing they\u2019re preying on you, and then you get devoured.

Hilarious!!\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu burst into laughter as if he wasn\u2019t even amused.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you will. Oh right, now that we\u2019re talking, let me say something else. Supernova Explosion. What the hell is Supernova Explosion? Aren\u2019t you embarrassed?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s expression quickly turned cold. He gripped the Spear of Purity unknowingly.", "\u201c\u2026Take that back.\u201d", "His naming sense being ridiculed was the one thing he refused to take sitting down.", "\u201cWhat, you want to go at it?\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu also gripped his spear, delighted.", "\u201cIya~ Mister Seol Jihu, you sure grew up.\u201d", "\u201cTake back what you said.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re a big boy now, huh. You think having a high physical level is it? Hmm?\u201d", "\u201cI warned you.\u201d", "\u201cShut up and come. Did I teach you to fight with your mouth?\u201d", "The two Seol Jihu\u2019s fixed their posture.", "Then, they simultaneously kicked off the ground, disappearing from the naked eye.", "Clang, clang!", "Only their afterimages flashed here and there, metallic rings resounding out.", "With spearmanship alone, Black Seol Jihu certainly might be superior. And the experience and application of skills he gained from countless battles was something that was enough to make up for his lacking physical level to a certain degree.", "The problem was to what degree.", "Black Seol Jihu created an opening in Seol Jihu\u2019s defense and attacked, but Seol Jihu struck down with his elbow and counterattacked.", "When Black Seol Jihu tried to strike back and Seol Jihu suddenly appeared behind him and hit him with his spear shaft, he almost fell backward from surprise.", "This couldn\u2019t be helped as Black Seol Jihu\u2019s only EX-rank stat was Mana, while Seol Jihu\u2019s Mana was at the Divine Beginning-rank. Since the rest of Seol Jihu\u2019s stats besides Luck were at EX-rank, it made sense that Black Seol Jihu wouldn\u2019t be his match.", "\u201cIndeed\u2026 you\u2019re in a much higher realm than Sung Shihyun. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke truthfully. He planned to beat Black Seol Jihu down from the start, but the latter\u2019s flawless spearmanship and movements had made him miss his chance each time.", "\u201c\u2026You son of a bitch.\u201d", "When Black Seol Jihu saw that Seol Jihu was genuinely looking down at him, a terrifying killing intent rose from his body. He roused his mana, intending on teaching Seol Jihu a lesson, but he regretted it in the next moment.", "For Black Seol Jihu, lightning bolts gathered to the tip of his spear when he used Hell Severing, but for Seol Jihu, the sky itself rumbled. And when Black Seol Jihu was hit with a Supernova Explosion that he made fun of, he experienced first-hand just how ridiculously powerful it was. Forget countering, he had to spend all his effort just to avoid it.", "\u2026Having a high physical level really was the be-all, end-all.", "\u201cYou really want to do this?\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu, who was charred black, gritted his teeth and released reinforced sword qi. However, the reinforced sword qi that shot out of Seol Jihu\u2019s Spear of Purity was much larger and denser and even radiated a brighter light.", "Black Seol Jihu became speechless for a moment at the purity of the light.", "\u201c\u2026You son of a bitch!\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu shouted as if he was wronged.", "It was inevitable for the disciple to one day surpass his master, but he couldn\u2019t help but think, isn\u2019t this too much!?", "*", "Kwang, kwang, kwang\u2026!", "\u201cMonsters\u2026 they\u2019re monsters\u2026.\u201d", "Watching the fight that shook both heaven and earth, Phi Sora shook her head and shuddered.", "She had failed to climb the second slope again. She was hungry, and since Baek Haeju just brought some food, she decided to take a breather and get some rest.", "Not long afterward, the wafting aroma made several others gather around it. Four or so women chatted about this and that.", "[It\u2019s true! I saw it!]", "There was Flone, talking passionately about something.", "\u201cE-Eh?\u201d", "And there was Seo Yuhui, who was gasping with her hand over her mouth, and also Baek Haeju, Chohong, Teresa, Phi Sora\u2026", "\u2026Of course, none of the women present knew yet. That this would become the start of what would become known as the \u2018Court Gathering\u2019.", "Kwang!", "\u201cHey, why is it so noisy there? Can\u2019t they see we\u2019re trying to eat?\u201d", "Chohong grumbled while cupping her hands over her ears.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. The two of them were chatting and then suddenly started fighting.\u201d", "Phi Sora picked up a fried chicken skewer and bit down on it. She couldn\u2019t hide her astonishment even as she watched Black Seol Jihu get beaten up with schadenfreude.", "\u201c\u2026I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d", "\u201cCan\u2019t believe what?\u201d", "\u201cThat person.\u201d", "Phi Sora continued while stammering.", "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine ever being like him. How did he get so strong even as a human, like the rest of us?\u201d", "Seol Jihu had once said he respected Phi Sora. Phi Sora also respected Seol Jihu. Not as a person, but as an Earthling.", "\u201cHe\u2019s really amazing, and I\u2019m not just saying this because he\u2019s our representative. Who would have thought that an Earthling capable of crushing an Army Commander would appear?\u201d", "Phi Sora stared with a look of admiration before suddenly tilting her head.", "\u201cBut\u2026\u201d", "She then began to giggle, making Chohong blink in confusion.", "\u201cWhy are you laughing all of a sudden?\u201d", "\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThink about it.

Baek Haeju, who was sitting a distance away from the rest of the group, also perked up her ears.", "\u201cHe\u2019s actually gotten a lot better these days. He was no joke in the past.\u201d", "\u201cYou mean how he searched for breasts like a baby whenever he slept?\u201d", "\u201cAh, that too. Listen, the two of us were drinking on Earth, and because he got really drunk, I took him to a motel. You wouldn\u2019t believe how much he\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Kuhum!\u201d", "Phi Sora raised her head in the middle of her story. Baek Haeju was coughing quietly with her hand over her throat.

I\u2019m still struck speechless whenever I think about it. Why the hell would he gift women that?\u201d", "\u201cHis taste is strange for sure\u2026.
