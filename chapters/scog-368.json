From then on, you\u2019re given only two choices: to reach the peak, or to quit.\u201d", "Baek Haeju\u2019s voice rang out.", "What she meant was that once the trial began, he couldn\u2019t increase or reduce the number of trials he wished to receive.", "\u201cAs long as you\u2019re human, you have your limits.
