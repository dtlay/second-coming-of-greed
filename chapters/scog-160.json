No matter what he did, rather than getting a taste of multiple things, he much preferred to dig into one thing.", "Looking back, he had gone through great changes during this training at the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain, and most of these changes had come consecutively.", "As Seol Jihu was used to achieving success after an arduous trial, this was an entirely new experience.", "Take the anti-evil attribute, for example. He was only Level 4, yet he had grasped an opportunity that only a few Level 6s ran into.", "Would he be able to wield a power he obtained with such ease properly?", "\u201cAnyways, this is strange.\u201d", "At that moment, Seo Yuhui spoke up.

How cute!\u2019", "Seol Jihu pondered for a long time before asking to be helped up. After sitting cross-legged with Seo Yuhui\u2019s help, he examined his internal body.", "The fiercely pounding heart, the rhythmically flowing blood, and the large, unknown reserves sleeping in parts of his body \u2014 everything was the same.", "The anti-evil lighting energy had simply been added to all these.", "Seol Jihu busily examined his body brimming with life force, and suddenly, courage shot up from the bottom of his heart.", "He felt confident he could do anything.", "\u2018Right.\u2019", "Thinking about it now, his growth rate had always been incredibly quick.

Perhaps, he was following a prearranged fate to prepare for the unknown future.", "There had to be a reason he came to possess the anti-evil attribute and an incredible growth rate.", "What was important was that this was not an opportunity he could miss and that he had willfully accepted it because he needed it.", "There was no use worrying about what was already done.", "The die had been cast.", "\u2018I\u2019ll just have to master it.\u2019", "When he thought that\u2014", "Twitch.", "The Essence of Soma, which felt out of place, suddenly dug deeper into his dantian.", "Ba-thump\u2014!", "Then, his heart jumped loudly. The intense reverberation almost caused Seol Jihu to open his tightly shut eyes.", "The pain endlessly tormenting his body slowly subsided until what little remained turned into a pleasant sensation that stimulated the muscles and veins.", "A golden light slowly enveloped Seol Jihu\u2019s flesh. When he opened his eyes, unable to endure any longer, brilliant golden light shone from his eyes.", "With that\u2026", "Pzzzt!", "A golden current of electricity crackled out, and powerful energy slowly emerged as if to peek its head out of the surface of the water.", "Seol Jihu subconsciously raised his chin and opened his mouth. Flop. His hands tilted back, and his chest strutted out.", "Feeling an impossibly pure and powerful energy that seemed to want to burst inside him, Seol Jihu roared silently.", "Terrifying lightning energy rippled out and shook the cave.", "Finally.", "A legend had finished the preparation to take its first step."]}
