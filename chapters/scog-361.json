She was Mikhail\u2019s teammate. She must have died as well.", "\u201cFor Level 4 Earthlings, the mortality rises dramatically to 50%. For Level 5, it further increases to about 60-70%. This means that six to seven in every ten people die.\u201d", "Jang Maldong spoke calmly.", "\u201cI\u2019m not making this up.

So did Chohong and Hugo. But he wasn\u2019t in any condition to talk. Dylan doesn\u2019t remember us.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2014 I had no idea. No one told me.\u201d", "\u201cOf course not.

But your behavior makes me think you do.\u201d", "Jang Maldong said, turning around to face the pots.", "\u201cThat place is definitely not a game. It\u2019s a different kind of reality.

In that sense, they perceive Paradise as a reality much more than you do.\u201d", "Jang Maldong continued.", "\u201cMany who undergo treatment still end up dead somewhere down the road. You saw it yourself. The mortality rate isn\u2019t the only problem. Even if you survive, you\u2019re likely to suffer from mental illness. It suffices to say that most former Earthlings develop some kind of problem post-death.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t stay that way.

What are you doing here?\u201d", "\u201cI came here on a vacation, so I thought I\u2019d pay you a visit.\u201d", "Jang Maldong answered in fluent French.", "\u201cAt this hour? You should\u2019ve come earlier!\u201d", "Ian chuckled, stroking his long beard.", "But then he looked at the young man next to Jang Maldong and tilted his head to the side.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen this young man before\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t think? So you\u2019re not sure?\u201d", "\u201cWell, he feels oddly familiar. It\u2019s strange. Why do I like him already? I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201d", "\u201cHuhu. You\u2019re still as quick-witted as ever. He\u2019s the one.\u201d", "Ian\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cNo way!\u201d", "\u201cYes, he\u2019s the main character of the novel you\u2019ve been writing. You said you wanted to meet him, so I brought him here.\u201d", "Ian quickly spun around, as if he had been stung by a bee.", "\u201cAh, come in, come in!\u201d he said in a hurry.", "Seol Jihu carefully went inside and sat down in the seat designated by Ian.", "\u201cLet\u2019s see. I know I put it here\u2026.\u201d", "Rummaging through his desk drawer, Ian pulled out a notebook and smiled triumphantly.", "Well-thumbed and faded, the notebook appeared to have been used for a long time.", "\u201cHuhu, so this day has finally come. Thank you, Mister Jang.\u201d", "\u201cI should be thanking you for staying alive.\u201d", "\u201cDamn you. Don\u2019t jinx me.\u201d", "With an upbeat smile, Ian turned to the young man.", "Seol Jihu was looking at the old man with slightly wet eyes.", "His heart felt heavy with indescribable emotion.", "He was glad to see Ian and, like Jang Maldong, glad that Ian was alive, especially because he had just come back from the hospital.", "\u201cUh\u2026. Could you tell him to stop looking at me with such passionate eyes? I\u2019m not interested in men.\u201d", "Jang Maldong gave a light chuckle.", "\u201c\u2026You look well.\u201d", "He translated Seol Jihu\u2019s words, and Ian smiled.", "\u201cSo you know who I am?\u201d", "\u201cYes, of course. You\u2019re Ian Denzel.\u201d", "\u201cHmm? Did I tell you my name was Ian Denzel?\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cSheesh! I can\u2019t believe I was so immature.\u201d", "Ian slapped his forehead and groaned.", "He then bowed his head politely.", "\u201c\u2018I apologize. The name Ian Denzel is actually an alias. My real name is Muah-Muah Tsaerb.\u2019 He says\u2026 but muah is a kissing sound and tsaerb is\u2026 well, try reading it backwards.\u201d", "Jang Maldong explained, clicking his tongue.", "Seol Jihu read it backwards and burst out laughing.", "He wiped the tears from his eyes and calmed his breath.", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed at all, Master Ian.\u201d", "\u201cJeez. It\u2019s no fun if you tell him.\u201d", "\u201cStill, I\u2019m glad. I really am.\u201d", "\u201cHuhu. That\u2019s right, how\u2019s the pink princess doing?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes brightened.", "\u2018He remembers Teresa?\u2019", "\u201cShe\u2019s doing fine. But how do you remember her? Don\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to ask me if my memories are intact, the answer is no.\u201d", "Ian snickered.", "\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t recognize your face. Today is my first time seeing it. My, as in me, who\u2019s here and now.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cBut I\u2019ve got some sense of the situation.\u201d", "\u2018Where should I start?\u2019 Ian closed his eyes, stroking his long beard.", "\u201cOne day, when I opened my eyes, I realized something was wrong. I woke up with most of my memories of the last few years gone. It was literally driving me crazy.\u201d", "Recalling those days, Ian smacked his lips.", "\u201cIt was incredibly painful. I suffered from a severe headache for no reason and felt so very empty that I almost lost my will to live. And then a note caught my eye.\u201d", "\u201cA note?\u201d", "\u201cIf one day you wake up and feel a sense of alienation, find the diary at your desk and read it. Read it, and replace the memories you\u2019ve lost with the contents of the diary. What\u2019s written in it is not a lie, it has actually happened\u2026. I saw these notes all over the house. So I went to look for the diary, and it really was there.\u201d", "Ian tapped lightly on the old notebook.", "\u201cI opened it and found a novel inside. A full-length, blockbuster novel. I couldn\u2019t help but admire it the whole time I read it. It was well-written, sure, but what caught my eye more than the author\u2019s writing skill was the fact that this novel was so surprisingly realistic. I've never read such a realistic novel in my life.\u201d", "\u201cSo the diary helped you overcome your sense of alienation?\u201d", "\u201cPerhaps. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve fully overcome it yet, but\u2026 at least I know for sure that I was the one who wrote the diary. The entries described in detail the habits that only I know.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled. He felt like he knew what those habits were.", "Ian scratched his cheek.", "\u201cAnyway, I read the diary from cover to cover. I read it whenever my sense of alienation began to creep in. And then, people I don\u2019t remember began to visit me. This finally made me realize that the diary wasn\u2019t just a novel, but a reality. Mister Jang is one of those people.\u201d", "Ian gave a warm smile, and Jang Maldong coughed awkwardly as he translated Ian\u2019s words.", "\u201cThanks to my previous efforts and help from dedicated friends, I now have a goal.\u201d", "Seol Jihu listened attentively. It still felt surreal to him that he could see Ian and hear Ian\u2019s voice.", "\u201cTo complete a novel based on my diary.\u201d", "\u201cA novel?\u201d", "\u201cYes. The story stopped in the middle, but I want to see it through. And, to do that, I had to switch the main character.\u201d", "Ian paused and winked at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cYou mean me?\u201d", "\u201cCorrect. The diary says your name is Seol?\u201d", "\u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d", "\u201cBut Mister Jang said that\u2019s not your first name.\u201d", "\u201cYes. Seol is my last name and Jihu is my first name. Seol is the last name character, Ji means strong and Hu means jade.\u201d", "\u201cI wondered, why did you only reveal your last name?\u201d", "\u201cI was embarrassed.\u201d", "\u201cAbout what? It\u2019s a great name!\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled broadly.", "\u201cYou said the same thing back then.\u201d", "\u201cBack when?\u201d", "\u201cJust before you passed away. You asked me the same question.\u201d", "\u201cOho. So that means you were by my side when I died\u2026.\u201d", "Ian squealed in glee.", "\u201cGood, that\u2019s good. That part wasn\u2019t in the diary. You\u2019ve seen my death with your own eyes, which means you can tell me about it in detail.\u201d", "He opened the diary, giggling as if he was having all the fun in the world.", "\u201cLet\u2019s see, where did it end\u2026. Ah, right, since you\u2019re here, can I ask you a couple of questions?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. As you wish.\u201d", "\u201cGood, good. I know you can\u2019t talk to me about the names of people and places because of penalties and stuff, but I still have plenty of questions for you besides all that. Also, there\u2019s something I really want to tell you.\u201d", "\u201cMe\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cHold on. Where is it\u2026 Ah, this part.\u201d", "Ian put on his reading glasses and pointed at a passage in the diary.", "It was written in French, so of course, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t read it.", "\u201cThe first thought that crossed my mind when I read this was\u2026 Why? Why did I say this? Was I drunk or something?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s only natural that what I used to think is different from what I think now. My past self had different knowledge and was in a completely different situation from mine.\u201d", "Suddenly, Ian\u2019s face became serious.", "\u201cThis part bothered me a lot as I read my diary. If you were to ask me the same question now, I\u2019d give you a slightly different answer. And now I finally have a chance to do just that.\u201d", "Ian spoke."]}
