Teresa\u2019s Tears (1)", "content": ["\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d", "\u201cKeeping a night watch.\u201d", "Maria replied with a lethargic voice.", "\u201cI had a nightmare about the expedition\u2019s rewards vanishing\u2026 I was worried they would disappear again\u2026\u201d", "She muttered while yawning. Seol Jihu blinked in a daze before bursting into laughter.", "As expected, reality was different from a dream.", "He had a sudden urge to jokingly ask, \u2018Wanna take the bags and run?\u2019 But he held himself back.", "He knew that would be rude, even to Maria.", "\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll stand watch now, so get some sleep.\u201d", "\u201cUun, it\u2019s okay~\u201d", "Maria shook her head.", "\u201cJust looking at these bags gets me brimming with energy\u2026.\u201d", "She chuckled like an addict, who just took a hearty dose of drugs.", "This looked dangerous on its own.", "Maria, who was staring blankly for a while, suddenly tapped on Seol Jihu\u2019s shoulder and nodded.", "\u201cRight, I gotta thank you. You did really well this time. I believed in you, you know? I believed you would strike it big one day, Oppa! That\u2019s right! This is the power of long-term investment!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I feel like you\u2019re treating me like I\u2019m some stock.\u201d", "Maria shut her mouth. She quickly waved her hands and chuckled.", "\u201cEii, don\u2019t say that! I\u2019m just grateful!\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "\u201cOf course! You see, I actually agreed with Kazuki and Princess Teresa fully. I mean, you really did everything, Oppa! Shouldn\u2019t we give you an even greater share?\u201d", "\u201cOho.\u201d", "A light flickered on in Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes.", "\u201cThese people. They\u2019re too busy trying to take care of themselves\u2026 tsk, tsk. I felt so bad that I was about to give you a cut of my share.\u201d", "Maria blabbered on about things she didn\u2019t mean, just to resolve any misunderstanding. The corners of Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth curled up.", "\u201cGreat! Then let\u2019s do that.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know you cared about me so much, Miss Maria\u2026 I\u2019m touched. Really, I\u2019m touched.\u201d", "\u201cN-No.\u201d", "\u201cThank you! I\u2019ll request to re-distribute the loot after breakfast. Just your share, of course.\u201d", "The drowsiness vanished from Maria\u2019s face. She became sullen, and her beady eyes quickly welled up with tears.", "Seol Jihu laughed inwardly and asked.", "\u201cThat\u2019s fine with you, right? You didn\u2019t lie just to please me, right?\u201d", "Maria clenched her fists. Trembling, she moved her tiny lips.", "\u201cOfv, ofv cwoursh\u2026 I mwean\u2026 whad I swaid\u2026.\u201d", "Finding the way she eked out those words too adorable, Seol Jihu grabbed onto his belly and burst out laughing.", "When he waved his hand and revealed that he was just joking, Maria\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cIiiiing~!\u201d", "Maria laughed and cried, charging at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d", "\u201cHmph! I hate you, Oppa!\u201d", "Maria thumped Seol Jihu\u2019s chest with her small baby hands. No, her fists had quite a bit of strength behind them to say she was \u2018thumping\u2019.", "\u201c\u2026What are you two doing?\u201d", "The commotion must have woken Chohong up as she asked with a swamped voice.", "\u201cArgh, my head. I drank too much last night\u2026.\u201d", "Groaning, she staggered up from her sleeping bag. Then, she trudged over with a frown.", "\u201cHey, Seol.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You\u2019re doing that on purpose, right?\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, Seol\u2019. It sounds weird.\u201d[1]", "\u201cWhat are you on about all of a sudden?\u201d", "Chohong grumbled, then sighed. Her breath, which reeked with alcohol, brushed past Seol Jihu\u2019s nose.", "\u201cAnyway, I was wondering\u2026\u201d", "Her face suddenly turned serious, and she asked gravely.", "\u201cAbout the dream\u2019s curse. Didn\u2019t we first get it from those Foxmen children? You know, the curse is contagious.\u201d", "\u201cYes. What about that?\u201d", "\u201cAnd we managed to get the curse lifted thanks to being quick on our feet.\u201d", "\u201cYep.\u201d", "\u201cThen what about those guys?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyebrows perked up at her sudden question.", "\u201cWhat guys?\u201d", "\u201cYou know, the guys who chased after Haeryeo.\u201d", "The moment he heard this\u2014", "\u201cWeren\u2019t those guys holding onto Haeya?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s breath paused stiff.", "\u201cThen what\u2019s gonna happen to them?\u201d", "His excitement instantly sank.", "\u201cAnd what if they enter the city\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cChohong.\u201d", "Seol Jihu muttered with a stiff expression.", "\u201cWake everyone up.\u201d", "The campsite bustled for a moment before getting quiet. Seol Jihu and several others tried to communicate back home.", "Teresa was the first to connect. She explained the situation and asked whether anything happened in Eva, but the reply that came back was an unexpected \u2018Nothing\u2019.", "There was no news of a curse anywhere. Not in Eva or any other city.", "It was something to be glad about for sure, but Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "For better or for worse, the expedition team found out why less than a day later. It was because they came across a large number of corpses on their way back home.", "Over twenty corpses were sprawled around a campsite. The team checked the site from a distance and confirmed the men to be the poachers they met a few days ago.", "\u201cThere were over forty people last time\u2026 so about half of them died.\u201d", "Kazuki muttered after examining the scene with his thousand-mile eyes. Seol Jihu asked.", "\u201cHow is it?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t see any signs of foul play. The nightmares must have devoured them.\u201d", "\u201cSo it\u2019s as we thought\u2026\u201d", "\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think we need to worry about it.\u201d", "Kazuki explained why.", "\u201cWhat the poachers want is obvious. I doubt whatever they fear will impact Paradise greatly.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head as this logically made sense.", "\u201cThen what happened to the other twenty poachers?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t see the leader\u2019s corpse.\u201d", "Kazuki continued with a monotonous voice.", "\u201cThis is just what I think, but the leader must have noticed.\u201d", "Right, with his subordinates suddenly collapsing to death, it would be weird if he didn\u2019t notice that a mysterious phenomenon was afflicting them.", "\u201cHe might not know about the true identity of the curse\u2026 but he should have at least realized that falling asleep would mean death. I suspect he went back to Eva without falling asleep and got himself treated by a Priest of Invidia.\u201d", "Seol Jihu made a dumbfounded expression.", "\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t that a terribly convenient hypothesis?\u201d", "\u201cIt is. But if it\u2019s that guy, it\u2019s definitely possible.\u201d", "Kazuki sounded strangely confident.", "\u201cIf you meet him again in the future, don\u2019t underestimate him. He made the top ranking in the Tutorial solely with his ability to read the air, and in the Neutral Zone, he even turned selling points into a profitable business.\u201d", "Seol Jihu doubted his ears. He did business in the Neutral Zone?", "\u2018How is that possible?\u2019", "\u201cNo matter how good he is at reading the air, how could he\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWell, we\u2019ll know once we go back. But let\u2019s thoroughly search this area just to be sure.\u201d", "The expedition team re-commenced their march, taking a roundabout path from where the corpses laid.", "After a few days, Seol Jihu found out that Kazuki perfectly hit the mark. It was because they ran into a group of Priests from Invidia\u2019s temple.", "They explained that a group of merchants had come to see them with a heavy curse on them and that they were now tracing the path they took to make sure the road was clear.", "The merchants apparently paid a large sum as compensation.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we met them outside the city. If they had entered with that curse\u2026\u201d", "Seeing the Priest shaking his head, Seol Jihu also breathed a sigh of relief.", "The expedition team resumed the march with lightened steps, then arrived at Eva shortly after. Nothing was wrong with the city, as reported.", "It would make sense for them to want to rest after finally arriving at a major city, but the team immediately got on a carriage ride back to Haramark.", "They didn\u2019t feel like they could sleep in peace until they entrusted their loot to Haramark\u2019s temple storage.", "*", "The long expedition was finally coming to an end. Under the pressure from the expedition team, the coachman drove his carriage through the wilderness day and night.", "As a result, it looked like they would arrive at Haramark the next morning.", "Seol Jihu took out the red egg while keeping the night watch. He had finished reading the two books on his way over.", "Righteous Heart seemed to be a mana cultivation method, while Crescent Blade Spear Technique was exactly what it sounded like. He guessed it had something to do with wielding the Spear of Purity.", "Although he couldn\u2019t measure their value just yet, they definitely looked vital to his future success. He planned to show them to Jang Maldong as soon as he got back.", "\u2018The problem is this.\u2019", "The spear and the egg.", "According to Flone, the Phoenix that was said to be the Rothschear House\u2019s guardian spirit was the same as the Rainbow Spirit named \u2018Arcus\u2019. Furthermore, he would need the guardian spirit\u2019s acknowledgment to be able to bring out the Spear of Purity\u2019s true power.", "To explain in more detail, the guardian spirit lived out its life with the person it acknowledged as its master. And when the master died, it would return to its egg form and wait for a new master.", "In other words, the spirit served as both a partner and an overseer.", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t the only one to be treated differently. Hundreds of past heads of the Rothschear House had to take the same test, and there were apparently many cases where they were not acknowledged by the guardian spirit.", "In those cases, they were only able to use a part of the Spear of Purity\u2019s power or were forced to step down as the head.", "Furthermore, the founding head seemed to be the only one who managed to bring out the Spear of Purity\u2019s full power.", "God-slaying.", "Because the spear\u2019s Authority was too powerful and dangerous, the Goddess of Chastity supposedly put this restriction on the spear purposely.", "\u2018Anyway, that means I have to hatch this egg somehow.\u2019", "Flone said the egg would only awaken through the power of a god. As this likely meant it needed divine power, Seol Jihu planned to drop by the temple once he returned.", "\u201cHeh.\u201d", "Seol Jihu suddenly chuckled in the middle of his deep thought. He had remembered Flone smacking his back when he tried to feed the egg offerings.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d", "At that moment, the sound of footsteps rang out along with the rustling of leaves. It was Teresa, who was also keeping the night watch with him.", "She said she needed to use the lady\u2019s room, but she took longer than he expected.", "\u201cWelcome back.\u201d", "\u201cThank you! Whew, I feel refreshed.\u201d", "Teresa plopped down next to Seol Jihu and leaned against his shoulder.", "\u201cJust the two of us under the night sky. How romantic~\u201d", "Seol Jihu tensed up. He couldn\u2019t underestimate Teresa at moments like this.", "\u201cOh yeah, come to think of it\u2014 you\u2019re the only one I haven\u2019t asked yet.\u201d", "Teresa turned her head and asked.", "\u201cWhat are you going to do first once you get back?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m going to eat until I\u2019m full and sleep.\u201d", "\u201cEii~ I meant where you\u2019re going to use your money.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled.", "Teresa had been full of smiles the past couple of days. He didn\u2019t know much about it, but the Haramark Royal Family seemed to have been suffering from severe financial difficulties since the war.", "He could tell just by how happy Teresa was, saying how she could now finally pay off her debts.", "\u2018From a young age, huh\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu admired Teresa inwardly while also pitying her slightly. Even though the expedition was a major success, the budget of a kingdom had to be on a different scale than what individual people spent.", "Though unlikely, he hoped Teresa would be able to use even a little bit of it for herself.", "\u201cI\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu calmly opened his mouth.", "\u201cI already know where the money will go, though not all of it will be for this.\u201d", "\u201cOh? And what\u2019s that?\u201d", "\u201cIt will be funding for forming a new organization.\u201d", "\u201cOrganization?\u201d", "Teresa\u2019s voice went up. She was only the fourth person after Hao Win, Jang Maldong, and Kazuki to find out about this, so it was no wonder that she would be surprised.", "\u201cOh wow! Really? You\u2019re going to form an organization?\u201d", "\u201cYep, I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a long time.\u201d", "\u201cFor a long time\u2026 right, Carpe Diem has four High Rankers. Now that you have money, it\u2019s no surprise.\u201d", "Teresa was overjoyed like it was her own business.", "\u201cHooray! Carpe Diem is finally going to become an organization! I\u2019ve been wanting that to happen since Dylan was the leader!\u201d", "She clapped her hands together and smiled beamingly.", "\u201cThen you\u2019ll need a bigger building, right~? And a bigger plot of land.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I looked into it already, and land is really expensive nowadays. That\u2019s why I planned this expedition.\u201d", "\u201cEi, then you should have come to me!\u201d", "Teresa tapped Seol Jihu\u2019s shoulder and smiled timidly.", "\u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly a maverick, huh, Mister Seol? Shouldn\u2019t you discuss important things like that with the lady of the house?\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cNever mind. Anyway, don\u2019t worry about it too much. We have a good plot of land in our possession\u2014\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d", "Seol Jihu realized the misunderstanding, seeing Teresa chatting excitedly like a girl singing about her dreams.", "\u201cOh! I have a good idea! Why not take my share of the loot and come to the palace? You can use that money for buying a plot of land and for the construction.\u201d", "\u2018Mm\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu was at a loss for what to do and shut his mouth in hesitation.", "\u201cI do feel a little sorry for father\u2026 but well, it all depends on how you look at it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be more than happy once I explain the situation. Mm, fraudster husband-and-wife. I like the sound of that.\u201d", "But this was something he eventually had to tell her, whether that be now or later. He couldn\u2019t just leave Haramark without a single word given the relationship they\u2019d built up. Thinking that this was the perfect opportunity, Seol Jihu quietly began to talk.", "\u201cI plan to leave Haramark.\u201d", "It was just five words. Despite that, Teresa\u2019s chatter stopped completely.", "Seol Jihu spoke with a little more force behind his words.", "\u201cI plan to go to Eva.\u201d", "And when he turned around and saw Teresa\u2014", "\u201cAnd in Eva, I\u2026?\u201d", "He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence.", "Whooooosh\u2014", "A cool night breeze swept through the campsite.", "\u201c\u2026Princess?\u201d", "Suddenly\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "The atmosphere froze.", "1. The words \u2018Hey, Seol\u2019 in Korean means \u2018erotica\u2019. "]}
