Things are getting pretty intense.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head. He knew now wasn\u2019t the time to be sitting around in a daze. He had to do something.", "Moreover, if the plan he just thought of was possible, they would now have a race against time on their hands.", "Seol Jihu followed Philip Muller back to the base camp.

Don\u2019t you know how difficult it is to reclaim a city that\u2019s been taken over?

How do they plan on taking responsibility for this?\u201d", "While some were criticizing Sung Shihyun and Sinyoung.", "Seol Jihu stared at Yun Seora as she silently endured all the criticisms. Then, he walked over to the empty seat at the head of the table.", "The moment Seol Jihu sat down, the chattering disappeared like a lie.", "It was because Seol Jihu\u2019s complexion was just as grave as the air inside the tent.", "As Seol Jihu was someone who usually had a stupid grin on his face, he gave off a different aura when he was this serious.", "Though it might sound ridiculous, Seol Jihu was called the Problem-solver or the Enforcer of Victory due to leading every expedition and war he had been a part of to success.", "This was Seol Jihu\u2019s first failure. Since the cause of his loss was an enemy from the inside, it made sense for him to be mad.", "\u201cHow\u2019s the situation?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked in a low voice as soon as he sat down.", "\u201cNot good. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d", "Philip Muller pressed his forehead.", "\u201cWe just got a call saying that the Parasites have begun to arrange their forces along all border regions.\u201d", "Teresa swept her hair up angrily.", "\u201cWe launched all sorts of attacks on the barrier just to be sure, and it didn\u2019t budge even a bit. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen a barrier unfazed by a Thunder.\u201d", "Wu Lei grumbled softly.", "\u201cThe Federation\u2019s military headquarters also organized their troops and are running over\u2026 They let us know that they discovered Unsightly Humility\u2019s army and the Parasite Queen near the Hiral Mountain Range.\u201d", "And White Tiger murmured while smacking his lips.", "Everyone gasped at this news.", "The Parasite Queen had lifted her heavy butt.", "Of course, she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the Empire\u2019s territory, but her intentions were clear.", "She was holding Tigol Fortress in check.", "Seol Jihu tapped on the table with his finger while organizing his thoughts.", "They had succeeded in besieging Scheherazade for now, but that was it. To break Gorad Boga\u2019s barrier, they would need to expend an incredible amount of firepower.", "Even if they somehow succeeded, that would only be the start of their problem as they would need to face five Army Commanders and their armies, all the while attacking them on their home turf.", "Breaking the barrier and defeating the Parasites\u2019 elite forces before they could secure the stele\u2026 To be honest, it didn\u2019t sound plausible.", "That wasn\u2019t all. The Parasites were supposedly deploying their forces in every city\u2019s border region, so they had to be wary of that as well.", "One wrong move and it might not be the five Army Commanders that were surrounded, but humanity\u2019s forces that were gathered around Scheherazade.", "Things were complicated, just like Philip Muller said.", "And once Seol Jihu thought this far, he judged that avoiding a battle was impossible.", "Though there was no guarantee of victory, a war was inevitable.", "The problem was with the stele.", "They had to prevent the Parasite Queen\u2019s revival no matter what. Currently, the joined forces of humanity and the Federation had some hope of victory, but if the Parasite Queen regained her full power and joined the front lines, then they would really be out of options.", "Seol Jihu thought deeply before asking.", "\u201cCan the Parasite Queen regain a portion of her strength by having one or two of the stele pieces?\u201d", "\u201cNo, definitely not.\u201d", "Philip Muller answered.", "\u201cAll three pieces have to be put together to form the complete stele. With even a single piece missing, they\u2019re no different than ordinary stones.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui nodded, agreeing with Philip Muller\u2019s explanation.", "\u2018I see.\u2019 Seol Jihu murmured inwardly and then turned his gaze to Baek Haeju.", "\u201cMiss Baek Haeju, I heard you were responsible for hiding the last piece of the stele.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cI heard you didn\u2019t hide it in the Federation\u2019s or humanity\u2019s territory. Does that mean\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "Baek Haeju gave an affirmation a beat later.", "\u201cI hid my piece of the stele in the Parasite\u2019s territory.\u201d", "\u201cOf all places\u2026.\u201d", "Teresa groaned quietly, but no one who took part in that expedition raised their voice. They knew from personal experience just how hard it must have been to hide the stele that was giving off such terrifying darkness.", "\u201cI had no choice. I wanted to hide it in the Spirit Realm at first\u2026 but the Federation refused.\u201d", "White Tiger let out a dry cough.", "\u201cThe Parasite Queen had fallen into a deep slumber from the effect of the Imperial Oath. I had to hide it before she could recover and sense the stele\u2019s location. I didn\u2019t have time to be picky. If it was a suitable place, I had to go with it.\u201d", "Baek Haeju continued.", "\u201cAt the time, I obtained a piece of information from Miss Seo Yuhui and investigated things related to Gorad Boga. Though I couldn\u2019t quite find a divine city, as a result, I was able to locate a similar place.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? You mean you went back into the Parasites\u2019 territory on your own?\u201d", "Wu Lei expressed his astonishment.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that difficult. The Parasite Queen was incapacitated from the Imperial Oath, and most of the Army Commanders were recuperating from having released their divinities. It was the prime time to infiltrate the Parasites\u2019 territory with them having lost most of their forces in their failed war against Tigol Fortress.\u201d", "\u201cAh, right, right\u2026.\u201d", "Wu Lei did a double-take and rubbed his chin.", "\u201cThen is the current plan to secure the last piece of the stele before the Parasites?\u201d", "After a moment of silence, Philip Muller carefully asked Seol Jihu.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad plan. If we succeed, not only will we prevent the Parasite Queen\u2019s revival, but the five Army Commanders\u2019 invasion will also have been for naught.\u201d", "If they succeeded, that is.", "It went without saying that the process involved in such a success wouldn\u2019t be easy.", "\u201cThere are too many things happening right now. First, the Parasites are deploying their troops to the frontline.\u201d", "\u201cUnsightly Humility is still with the main army, and more importantly, we will have to enter the enemy territory. Fighting within the Parasites\u2019 territory will not be easy.\u201d", "Speaking of which, Gabriel also said that the Parasites\u2019 corrupted territory was essentially equivalent to having four or five corrupted World Trees on their side.", "\u201cAnd that\u2019s not all. Roe Scheherazade said she would give us time, but how can we trust her? For all we know, she might have used the Royal Oath already.\u201d", "\u201cThe Parasites might already be on the move to secure the last piece of the stele.\u201d", "The points that were brought up were all correct.", "In fact, that was what Seol Jihu was worried about the most.", "Entering the Parasites\u2019 territory would be difficult enough. Their efforts would have been wasted if they arrived at the last stele piece\u2019s location, and it was already taken.", "There was a considerable chance that they would suffer meaningless sacrifice.", "\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be able to get their hands on it right away.\u201d", "At that moment, Baek Haeju spoke up.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes shot open.", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cThey might be able to figure out the location, but taking the stele out would be another problem.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s dull eyes finally lit up.", "\u201cYou mean the place you hid the stele is also protected like Gorad Boga?\u201d", "\u201cKind of.\u201d", "Baek Haeju explained.", "\u201cI hid the stele in the catacombs that were managed by a family from the era of the ancient Empire. How should I say this\u2026 an odd, spiritual aura flowed inside it. The catacombs went deep underground and had complex corridors. Moreover, there was a guardian preventing others from entering the deepest level.\u201d", "\u201cGuardian? Then how did you\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThough I had no relationship with the place, I was able to talk with the guardian. He was once a noble and wise sage of the Empire, and he understood the situation humanity was in. I passed his trial\u2026\u201d", "Baek Haeju raised her hand in the middle of talking and drew a circle.", "\u201cAnd I obtained the qualification to enter the deepest level.\u201d", "Next, she took out a faded insignia from her Dimensional Pocket.", "Though her fingers were covering it, Seol Jihu felt like he had seen the insignia before.", "\u201cThe guardian disappeared after giving me this insignia, but the barrier blocking the way to the deepest level is still active.\u201d", "\u201cHow powerful is that barrier?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s beyond human understanding to judge its strength. I only noticed after going down, but the deepest level was not in the Middle World. If someone without the insignia enters, they will be trapped in an unknown dimension and forced to roam there for eternity.\u201d", "Baek Haeju put the insignia back into her Dimensional Pocket.", "\u201cOf course, I\u2019m sure that the barrier can be broken from the outside\u2026. But I\u2019m sure even a god will have a hard time breaking a barrier that is connected to an unknown number of dimensions.\u201d", "Seol Jihu clenched his fists.", "The place Baek Haeju hid the stele was similar to Gorad Boga, but there was one key difference.", "The Parasites would not be able to get their hands on it even if they knew where it was.", "In contrast, Baek Haeju would easily be able to obtain it as long as she got there.", "\u201cCan you tell us where the stele is located?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d", "Baek Haeju looked around at her surroundings.", "Philip Muller quickly chanted a spell, and an opaque barrier was cast around Seol Jihu and Baek Haeju.", "Baek Haeju examined the barrier before saying.", "\u201cDo you have a map?\u201d", "Seol Jihu immediately took out a map from his pocket and spread it open on the table.", "\u201cThe place I went to was\u2026\u201d", "Baek Haeju placed her finger on the map and traced out a course in a fluid motion. When she eventually stopped, she stared at the location with a slightly surprised look.", "Seol Jihu looked at the map more closely. A small circle was drawn where Baek Haeju\u2019s finger had stopped.", "\u201cWhy is there a\u2026?\u201d", "Baek Haeju blinked. She seemed to be asking why a circle was drawn on this spot.", "\u201cWait, this place\u2026\u201d", "[Eh? Isn\u2019t this\u2026 that?]", "Flone also sounded surprised.", "Right, the circled spot was one of the five places where the Rothschear\u2019s inheritance was buried. Among them, it was the place that Flone had only heard of without knowing exactly what was buried.", "[This is where my family\u2019s inheritance is buried!]", "\u201cE-Excuse me?\u201d", "Baek Haeju showed a rare hint of fluster.", "[But how\u2026 What was inside?]", "\u201cJust\u2026 a bit of everything\u2026\u201d", "[What did you do with it?]", "\u201c\u2026I took it all\u2026.\u201d", "Baek Haeju replied with an uneasy feeling, and Flone responded dejectedly.", "Seol Jihu chuckled.", "He finally figured it out.", "The guardian Baek Haeju mentioned must have been an existence that protected the Rothschear\u2019s inheritance like Roselle.", "Unlike Roselle, who had lingering attachments in the world, the guardian must have left unencumbered after meeting someone who was qualified.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Knowing where it is, is enough.\u201d", "Though having the inheritance taken away was a bit of a shame, it was a common occurrence in Paradise. Moreover, the inheritance wasn\u2019t much of a concern at this point.", "Seol Jihu checked the location one last time before knocking on the barrier.", "The opaque barrier quickly disappeared.", "\u201cI\u2019ll sum it up.\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked around at everyone and continued.", "\u201cThe stele inside Gorad Boga and the stele inside the catacombs\u2026 We must not let the Parasites take both. Furthermore, the Parasite Queen and the Parasites\u2019 main army, excluding the five Army Commanders and their armies, are stationing themselves at the Federation\u2019s and humanity\u2019s border regions. Is everything correct so far?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui, Baek Haeju, and Philip Muller nodded one after the other.", "\u201cThen\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s low voice instantly turned clear. He had finally found a faint piece of hope.", "\u201cWe still have time.\u201d", "Hearing this, everyone fixed their gaze on Seol Jihu.", "It sounded like he had a plan, one that would overturn this rapidly deteriorating situation.", "\u201cNow\u2014\u201d", "While everyone was staring with eyes full of expectation\u2026", "\u201cI will explain the plan.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes lit up with elegant light."]}
