The Shade of the Giant Tree (1)", "content": ["Seol Jihu and Phi Sora moved ten steps away from each other and took out their respective weapons.", "They stood in a vacant lot behind the Valhalla building, where people rarely visited.", "They chose this place on purpose because they didn\u2019t want to attract other members\u2019 attention.", "Jang Maldong stood away from the two before suddenly dropping his gaze down to his feet.", "Next to him, a tiny yellow fuzzball was staring at Seol Jihu and Phi Sora.", "He seemed to have found his way here on his own.", "Jang Maldong opened his mouth to ask him how he found out about the duel, but in the end, he just turned his eyes back to the lot.", "There were two reasons. The first was that, with his tiny wings folded over his chest, the chick didn\u2019t seem to want to be disturbed. The second was that Jang Maldong sensed Phi Sora\u2019s movement.", "Phi Sora stared at Seol Jihu and slowly stretched out her right arm.", "The tip of her sword pointed at her opponent.", "Seol Jihu stood motionless.", "His spear hung horizontally in a relaxed grip as he faced Phi Sora\u2019s fierce gaze with unwavering eyes.", "A moment later, as Phi Sora bent her knees, Seol Jihu\u2019s body turned slightly to the right.", "The war of nerves continued unabated when suddenly\u2026.", "\u201cHaa!\u201d", "With a sharp cry, Phi Sora sprang through the air.", "She ran and then kicked the ground with all her might.", "As she soared into the air, Phi Sora raised her right arm above her head, then swung it forward with brute force towards Seol Jihu.", "Clang!", "Seol Jihu lifted his spear.", "He parried Phi Sora\u2019s sword, but it quickly found its way back to his chin.", "The blade scraped across Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "Phi Sora was persistent.", "She changed the direction of her sword again and Seol Jihu hurriedly plunged his spear down.", "In response, Phi Sora gracefully pulled her sword back and thrust it forward once more.", "It was then.", "Tang! A sudden, intense pain jolted through her right hand.", "Seol Jihu had spun his spear in a semicircle and struck the back of her sword.", "The clash was so strong that she almost dropped her sword.", "Phi Sora managed to straighten her posture and tried again to stab her opponent.", "However\u2026.", "\u201cUuk!\u201d", "By then, the blunt end of Seol Jihu\u2019s spear had already hit her stomach.", "This threw Phi Sora off her balance, and she stumbled backward a few steps before falling to the ground.", "As she placed her hand on her stomach, the expression on her face was that of astonishment.", "\u2018What the\u2026? His speed and strength are just\u2026.\u2019", "They were incomparable to the past.", "If this was real combat, she\u2019d be dead by now. Phi Sora glanced upwards.", "Seol Jihu was quietly looking down at her.", "Her eyes shot wide open.", "\u201cThat was\u2014\u201d", "But instead of finishing her sentence, she was forced to stand back up.", "This time, Seol Jihu dashed at Phi Sora.", "He lifted his spear above his head and swung it down at his opponent.", "As soon as she got up, Phi Sora moved her sword diagonally to block the spear approaching her left shin.", "This caused her upper body to twist unnaturally, and not missing his chance, Seol Jihu quickly thrust his spear into Phi Sora\u2019s left side.", "Phi Sora clenched her teeth. Had the opponent\u2019s attack come from the right or at least from the front, she could\u2019ve deflected it by swinging her sword as hard as she could.", "But in this position, the position she was forced to maintain by her opponent, evading an attack was nearly impossible.", "Seol Jihu seemed intent on beating her up by keeping her off balance.", "When she raised her sword to block the attack, as she was given no other choice, Seol Jihu\u2019s spear swished gracefully in front of her face.", "Phi Sora was forced to take a step back.", "She told herself she\u2019d use this chance to collect herself, but she knew as soon as she stepped back that her opponent had gained the upper hand on her.", "To make matters worse, Seol Jihu began thrusting his spear left and right, as if not to give Phi Sora a chance to think.", "Phi Sora pulled herself back, swinging her body from side to side.", "Sssshk! Like a shooting star, the blade slashed the air in front of her face.", "Phi Sora turned her head in a hurry, but her eyes remained fixed on Seol Jihu and his spear.", "One chance. Just one chance would be enough.", "Right now, he was throwing her off with consecutive attacks, but his movements were likely to get bigger as he prepared the final blow.", "It would be her chance to strike.", "It was then that Seol Jihu spun around with his back to her.", "This was the big motion Phi Sora had been waiting for.", "She raised her longsword intuitively, but panicked.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s reaction was astonishingly fast.", "Before Phi Sora could do anything, her opponent turned his body and thrust his spear at her like a lightning bolt.", "She managed to deflect it with her sword, but he swung his spear again almost immediately as if everything were part of a prearranged choreography. The swiftness of his attack shocked her.", "Phi Sora\u2019s strength, endurance, and stamina were top class, but her agility still remained at Intermediate (Low).", "On the other hand, Seol Jihu\u2019s agility was High (Low).", "Their agilities differed by three steps, so it was only natural that she struggled to keep up with him.", "Cha-cha-cha-chang! Loud, metallic clanging sounds rang out consecutively.", "It took all of Phi Sora\u2019s effort just to block her opponent\u2019s attacks.", "Suddenly she stopped.", "\u2018Damn it\u2026!\u2019", "She knew that at this rate it was only a matter of time before the spear broke through her defense.", "She had to find a way to turn the tide of battle amidst the clashing of the blades.", "Clang, clang!", "Her arms shook violently with each clash and she frowned.", "She pushed the spear away from her left shoulder and took a chance.", "She tilted her longsword and thrust it half a beat faster towards the right.", "Swish! Phi Sora felt the spear slide past the back of her sword and smiled crookedly.", "She had him attack her twice in the left direction and then launched a surprise attack in the opposite direction.", "The attack was the result of a careful analysis of Seol Jihu\u2019s movement patterns.", "As the spear slipped past her sword, Phi Sora swung her arms wide and brandished the sword from top to bottom.", "The spear spun in midair before lodging into the ground.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes flinched a little and Phi Sora grinned.", "When she held the spear in place with one hand and plunged towards Seol Jihu, he quickly pulled the spear back and turned his body.", "\u201cHa!\u201d", "Phi Sora almost burst into laughter.", "Turning and twisting the body was often an unnecessary movement during combat.", "She could always just let go of the spear, and she felt confident that she could reach Seol Jihu before he could reach her.", "Phi Sora moved closer, certain of her victory.", "However.", "\u201cKuheuk!\u201d", "Suddenly she felt a sharp pain in her pelvis.", "Because she was moving very fast, her waist bent almost in half.", "The pain caused Phi Sora to stop in her tracks, and when her head drooped down she saw the blunt end of the spear buried deep in her pelvis.", "Seol Jihu had thrust his spear backward with his back towards her.", "More than half of Phi Sora\u2019s predictions hadn\u2019t come true.", "It was true that Seol Jihu turned around, but he stopped halfway.", "At the same time, he had held his spear backward and pushed it towards her.", "He only used the blunt end because they were sparring. If this had been real combat, he would not have hesitated to use the head.", "And if he had done so, she would have died even before she had a chance to move closer.", "She could have avoided this attack if she had been more careful.", "But this was the first gap in his defense she had discovered since their sparring began and she just couldn\u2019t be patient enough. Ultimately, her impatience had become the cause of her defeat.", "\u2018No way.\u2019", "Phi Sora\u2019s lips trembled.", "The fact was that she had already been struck twice.", "It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t admit it, she just couldn\u2019t help but doubt that her opponent was playing her.", "She felt completely helpless.", "A moment later Seol Jihu turned around and waved his spear fiercely.", "With a cry of rage, Phi Sora blocked the spear with her longsword, but she couldn\u2019t manage to block his kicks.", "Puk! When the third kick landed on her stomach, Phi Sora finally dropped her sword and fell backward.", "Only then did Seol Jihu stop, relaxing his grip on his spear.", "A strange silence descended upon the vacant lot.", "But it didn\u2019t last long.", "As Seol Jihu opened his mouth to speak to Phi Sora, who sat on the ground dazed, he suddenly backed away with a flinch.", "Less than a second later, a series of daggers struck where he had just stood.", "\u201cYo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo~!\u201d", "He knew who she was just by her voice.", "Hoshino Urara jumped from the terrace of the dormitory floor and landed on her feet.", "\u201cYou\u2019re finally here! You traitor!\u201d", "With her back to the building, she pointed her finger at Seol Jihu.", "Seol Jihu tilted his head curiously.", "\u201cTraitor?\u201d", "\u201cDid you forget about our contract!?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cFun is the only reason I\u2019m here!

Death is what a traitor deserves! I\u2019ll have you pay for deceiving me\u2026. Eh?\u201d", "Papapapak! Hoshino Urara suddenly began blinking rapidly.", "The reason was that the four daggers had turned midair and returned to her.", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "Hoshino Urara\u2019s eyes moved slowly.", "One dagger was above her head, the other two were under her armpits, and the last dagger was between her legs.", "She could still feel the daggers vibrating against the wall.", "At the same time, she felt an enormous aura in front of her.", "Slowly, Seol Jihu\u2019s hair was rising upwards.", "Her interruption was unexpected, but he always welcomed a good sparring partner.", "Hoshino Urara was a Unique Ranker. There was no doubt she would be a suitable partner.", "Seol Jihu only was raising his mana because his opponent seemed to have done so.", "Hoshino Urara\u2019s blinking grew more rapid.", "The same was true for Phi Sora.", "Her jaw slowly dropped as she looked up at Seol Jihu.", "His body seemed almost fused with mana and was now boiling as one big lump of energy.", "\u201c\u2026Heh. Good. This is what I expect from my employer!\u201d", "Hoshino Urara muttered gallantly and grabbed a dagger with each of her hands.", "And then she bowed her head down.", "\u201cI apologize!\u201d", "She even knelt down before Seol Jihu.", "\u201cI won\u2019t do it again! Please forgive me!\u201d", "She stabbed the ground with her daggers and threw herself on the ground, her forehead touching the dirt.", "Seol Jihu looked disappointed.", "He was just getting into the game.", "This person\u2014 she was as spontaneous as ever.", "\u201c\u2026Go.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re really letting me go?\u201d", "\u201cThis will be the last time.

I\u2019ll be a good girl now!\u201d", "Hoshino Urara crawled away in the kneeling position.", "Her cockroach-like movements amazed Seol Jihu.

Now, everything seems clear\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s face darkened.

The old man\u2019s eyes were wavering slightly.", "\u201cWhat\u2026 happened to you?\u201d", "Jang Maldong barely managed to ask.", "He stood with a look of disbelief across his face.", "His reaction was understandable. Seol Jihu completely crushed Phi Sora.", "His technical skills as well as his physical capabilities greatly surpassed those of Phi Sora.", "Pressing Phi Sora, who controlled the sword as if it were part of her body, to move according to his will?", "Impossible. Unless\u2014", "There was only one possible explanation. Seol Jihu had reached a greater realm than Phi Sora.", "One thing Jang Maldong had noticed about the way Seol Jihu moved was that not only was he controlling the spear as if it were part of his body, but his determination and his weapon seemed almost united.", "\u201cMm\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong looked at him wide-eyed for an explanation, and Seol Jihu slowly said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a slightly\u2026 no, a very long story. Is that alright?\u201d", "*", "They moved to a different area and Seol Jihu explained to Jang Maldong about what had happened.", "Of course, he was careful to leave out certain things, about Nine Eyes and Black Seol Jihu\u2019s true identity, for example.", "The explanation took a long time because Jang Maldong was eager to learn all the details.", "But it still would have taken a long time if he hadn\u2019t. The story was worth seven years after all.", "\u201c\u2026Unbelievable.\u201d", "Jang Maldong couldn\u2019t hide his amazement.", "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, really.\u201d", "He exclaimed and shook his head.", "He was proud of Seol Jihu for facing the trials head-on and awed by the mysterious helper that Gula had sent.", "On the other hand, he was pissed.", "Jang Maldong himself had always been distressed by the fact that Seol Jihu\u2019s insight had been too average to rise to the level of a realm.", "And he agreed that hands-on learning was the key. There was only so much a person could learn by simply listening to a lecture.", "Even so, Seol Jihu had been pushed too far. Jang Maldong was shocked to learn that the training had caused Seol Jihu to fall into a state of senselessness.", "Seol Jihu could have collapsed mentally in the process and it was this fact that angered Jang Maldong.", "He was just glad that Seol Jihu\u2019s efforts were well compensated in the form of Perfect Harmony.", "\u201cYou did well. It must have been hard.\u201d", "\u201cI want to tell you that I\u2019m okay\u2026 but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t deny that it was hard\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu murmured and smiled bitterly.", "\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d", "Jang Maldong gave a bitter smile as well.", "It was then that they heard a voice calling them.", "Chohong was yelling at them, \u2018wrap it up and let\u2019s begin the welcome party!\u2019", "Quite some time had passed while they were talking and the evening sun was setting.", "\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s go.\u201d", "There was nothing more left to say.", "Jang Maldong slowly got up from his seat.", "\u201cHaha. I can\u2019t believe it. Seven years you say. Seven years\u2026.\u201d", "He patted Seol Jihu on the shoulder and turned around.", "At the same time, he heaved a heavy sigh.", "He finally understood how Seol Jihu became a completely different person in just eight months.", "The change was the result of seven years of rigorous, restless training.", "\u2018The result is really impressive, beyond comparison. He\u2019s just one step away from achieving Trinity Harmony\u2026. Now I\u2019m curious about that helper.\u2019", "Jang Maldong nodded as he walked down the stairs. Then suddenly, he stopped and turned around.", "\u201cWell, don\u2019t you think you were too harsh on her? You\u2019ve been training for seven years, but she\u2019s only trained for a few months.\u201d", "\u201cBut she used to be better than me. There was the possibility that her eight months were worth more than my seven years.\u201d", "\u201cSo you didn\u2019t let your guard down. I suppose you\u2019re right. She left without complaint because she knew you\u2019d taken her seriously. She\u2019d be upset if you\u2019d been easy on her.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s why I tried my best\u2026. Do you think that was the right choice?\u201d", "Jang Maldong thought for a second and let out a sigh.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know.

She even took on the role of a party starter.", "\u201cThe first glass goes to our representative, in celebration of his safe return!\u201d", "To the representative!", "Everyone shouted after Phi Sora.", "She emptied her first glass of wine and opened a new bottle.", "\u201cAnd the second glass\u2014 goes to our representative, who, after months of rigorous training is now much stronger than before!\u201d", "To the representative!", "\u201cAnd the third glass\u2014 also goes to our representative, who just can\u2019t seem to control his strength, showing off his new skills like he can\u2019t forget the past!\u201d", "\u201cTo the representatiiive!\u201d", "Hoshino Urara\u2019s voice especially stood out.", "Seol Jihu glared at Phi Sora, but she pretended not to notice and emptied her drink.", "Her reddened neck showed that she was drunk.", "Nevertheless, he had fun.", "Almost all members of Valhalla had gathered for the celebration, and the housebound ghosts delivered food and wine to them under Flone\u2019s command.", "As the night advanced, everyone ate and drank merrily and the echoes of laughter filled the hall.", "The only problem was that the wine seemed endless.", "\u201cDrink! Drink! Drink till you drop!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026This is crazy. How much wine did they get?\u201d", "Oh Rahee muttered in disdain as she watched Chohong pour two bottles worth of wine into her mouth.", "It wasn\u2019t until after midnight that the party from hell quieted down.", "This was far from saying that the party was dead. It was only quiet compared to the beginning, and many people were still conscious.", "\u201cHmm? We\u2019re out of drinks already?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s more in the kitchen. I\u2019ll go get them.\u201d", "\u201cWoah. I\u2019ll leave it to you, team leader~\u201d", "Chohong slurred loudly and waved the empty bottle in her hand. Phi Sora got up.", "\u2018I- I can\u2019t anymore\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu also got up from his seat.", "\u2018Liver\u2026 I have to save my liver\u2026.\u2019", "Shuffling across the room, he almost stepped on Marcel Ghionea, who had passed out on the floor, but managed to make it out in one piece.", "\u2018I thought I\u2019d die.\u2019", "Maybe he was hallucinating because he drank too much.", "He saw Maria collecting empty bottles of wine, muttering to herself, \u201cThese should fetch a lot.\u201d", "Seol Jihu decided to take a walk to sober up.", "He saw a room with the light on at the end of the dark hallway. He peeked inside and found Eun Yuri.", "He remembered seeing her at the party earlier that evening.", "Eun Yuri seemed to have left early to study.", "Her pen was moving busily, jotting down complex formulas over the paper.", "The light illuminating her room was the product of light magic.
