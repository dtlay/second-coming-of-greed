Whether it was interesting or not wasn\u2019t the problem.", "What mattered was whether it was doable or not.", "\u201cThis is urgent, Teacher.\u201d", "\u201cHmm. If you\u2019re asking a yes or no question\u2026\u201d", "Roselle rubbed her slim chin with the tip of her hand.", "Eun Yuri focused on Roselle\u2019s mouth, suppressing her pounding heart.", "Roselle La Grazia was a truly incredible teacher and an extraordinary sorcerer. If they could borrow her strength for the upcoming war, it would be equivalent to obtaining a thousand troops and horses.", "Soon, as Eun Yuri was sweating internally from anxiety, Roselle\u2019s lips opened in a smile.", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "Eun Yuri\u2019s complexion brightened.", "\u201c\u2018It should be possible,\u2019 is my answer if we\u2019re only looking at the result.\u201d", "Roselle continued in a monotonous voice.", "\u201cBut to obtain the fruit called result, we will need to go through an unavoidable process. That is, to bear fruit, we will need to overcome four difficulties.\u201d", "\u201cFour? That many?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Two of the four can be done with our strengths, but the other two must be left to heaven\u2019s will.\u201d", "After saying this, Roselle looked sharply at Eun Yuri.", "\u201cSo, do you still want to give it a try?\u201d", "\u201cYes, I do.\u201d", "Eun Yuri replied without a shred of hesitation.", "Roselle closed her mouth and gave a renewed look.", "\u201cOh my, you have such beautiful eyes. Burning with passion, it\u2019s almost like I am looking at my younger self.\u201d", "She giggled while nodding.", "\u201cAlright. My precious disciple wants to help her dear husband, who is going to war. This teacher will roll up her sleeves and help out.\u201d", "\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it at all.\u201d", "Eun Yuri firmly denied the accusation.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 he looked so overwhelmed. Like he would fall if no one held him up\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes, I understand. I\u2019d love to hear more about the stories of this young love, but since time is short, let\u2019s cut to the chase.\u201d", "Roselle raised four fingers.", "\u201cFirst are the problems we can\u2019t solve. One of them is obviously the revival of the World Tree. If this matter cannot be achieved, even I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d", "The entire plan was based on the revival of the World Tree. As this point was rather obvious, Eun Yuri nodded in agreement right away.", "\u201cThe second problem is getting the permission of the revived World Tree.\u201d", "\u201cPermission?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Once the World Tree revives, it will regain total control over the pathway connecting to its avatar in the Middle World. So we will need to explain our circumstances and ask for its permission to borrow the pathway.\u201d", "Simply put, they needed the permission of the World Tree to use the pathway.", "\u201cThese two are the problems we have no control over. Now, shall we talk about the problems that we can try to solve?\u201d", "Eun Yuri fixed her posture.", "\u201cAs I said before, Miss Eun Yuri\u2019s idea is interesting. But even if we somehow succeed, it is unknown whether I can utilize my full strength in the Middle World.\u201d", "\u201cWhy is that?\u201d", "\u201cBecause the Astral World is a space where two worlds are overlapped. By being in that world, half of me would be in one world and the other half would be in the other world. So even if I use my full strength in the Dream World, I suspect only half of the power will reach the Middle World.\u201d", "\u201cBut Teacher\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI know. What Miss Eun Yuri is saying is not simply about the Astral World. It is true that the outcome is unclear if we can use the World Tree\u2019s pathway. That is what makes the outcome unknown.\u201d", "Roselle cleared her throat after explaining her reasoning.", "\u201cNot knowing the outcome\u2014 that means we cannot be certain. Do not bet on uncertainty. Have you heard that saying?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cSo won\u2019t we need to change this uncertainty to certainty?\u201d", "\u201cIs that something we can do?\u201d", "\u201cMy, you\u2019re truly full of questions today. Do I not always say you should think for yourself first before asking questions?\u201d", "Eun Yuri bit her lower lip at her teacher\u2019s scolding.", "Roselle rested her chin on the back of her clenched fist and said.", "\u201cRemember. When you\u2019re facing a difficult problem\u2014\u201d", "\u201c\u2018Think simply,\u2019 is what you said.\u201d", "\u201cExactly. When trying to solve a problem, always go for simplicity. Now, what should be done for me to utilize my full strength in the Middle World?\u201d", "\u201cWe need to take half of the Astral World that is resting in the Dream World and bring it to the Middle World.\u201d", "\u201cBut that is impossible given the nature of the Astral World, so you will need to come up with a different method~\u201d", "Roselle glanced at Eun Yuri stealthily.", "\u201cNow let\u2019s think, what schools of magic were there again\u2026?\u201d", "She threw her a hint. After mulling over it, Eun Yuri exclaimed quietly.", "\u201cSoul manifestation!\u201d[1]", "\u201cExactly.\u201d", "Roselle smiled.", "\u201cThough I am just a will, Roselle La Grazia most certainly exists in this world and is akin to a god who created the Dream World. If Miss Eun Yuri can learn soul manifestation magic to a high enough level, fully summoning me would not be a dream.\u201d", "She raised her hands before continuing.", "\u201cOf course, it might be a waste of your effort\u2014 but this teacher thinks that the core value of a Magician is to prepare what they can, rather than leaving something to luck. What do you think?\u201d", "Eun Yuri\u2019s eyes lit up.", "\u201cYes!\u201d", "Hearing Eun Yuri\u2019s energetic reply, Roselle smiled in satisfaction.", "\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s put your study of the Path of Mana on hold. From today onward, I will teach you about soul manifestation. Let me give you a fair warning. It isn\u2019t an easy discipline so you best brace yourself!\u201d", "Roselle turned away after giving a stern warning. Looking at a white-blonde-haired girl, who was watching them blankly, she spoke.", "\u201cCharlotte?\u201d", "\u201cH-Hmm?\u201d", "\u201cSince things have come to this, you will be on self-study until further notice. This is an urgent matter, so I seek your understanding.\u201d", "\u201cO-Okay, I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria did her best to reply nonchalantly, but she couldn\u2019t hide the disappointed expression on her face. Although she was dense, she could still understand that Roselle meant, \u2018Teaching her one on one will be more efficient, so don\u2019t bother us.\u2019", "\u201cThank you. Then for the fourth and last problem\u2026\u201d", "Roselle paused just before turning back to Eun Yuri. She gazed attentively at the sullen Charlotte Aria.", "\u201c\u2026Hold on.\u201d", "After asking Eun Yuri for her understanding, Roselle walked forward softly. She then gently spoke to the girl dejectedly looking down.", "\u201cWhy are you so crestfallen?\u201d", "\u201cHmm? No, I\u2026\u201d", "Charlotte Aria murmured in a halting voice.", "\u201cYou\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 both Teacher and Yuri are amazing\u2026\u201d", "\u201cBecause we\u2019re amazing? Is that really it?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "When Roselle asked again\u2014", "\u201c\u2026I\u2014\u201d", "She carefully replied.", "\u201cI want to help too\u2026 but I didn\u2019t understand anything Teacher and Yuri talked about\u2026 and I can\u2019t think of a good idea like Yuri\u2026\u201d", "\u201cAha.\u201d", "Roselle grinned.", "\u201cHmm, he must be very happy. Having two beautiful and adorable ladies loving and caring for him.\u201d", "\u201cN-No! That\u2019s not it!\u201d", "Charlotte Aria waved her hands dismissively in a fluster.", "Roselle asked, giggling at the reaction that wasn\u2019t far off from Eun Yuri\u2019s.", "\u201cCharlotte, aren\u2019t you in a position to help him? You are the queen of a kingdom, after all.\u201d", "\u201cI-I am, but\u2026 how should I say this\u2026\u201d", "Charlotte Aria\u2019s voice got quieter by the second.", "\u201cI\u2019m useless, I don\u2019t know things well\u2026 I even entrusted government affairs to the royal administrator\u2026\u201d", "She must be embarrassed as she couldn\u2019t meet Roselle\u2019s eyes.", "\u201cHnng.\u201d", "With a nasal hum, Roselle studied the queen with a renewed gaze.", "\u2018My, my.\u2019", "Roselle exclaimed internally after reading her thoughts.", "Strictly speaking, it was hard to say Charlotte Aria was more excellent than Eun Yuri. It wasn\u2019t simply a matter of talent. What Roselle emphasized the most in her teachings was the attitude in researching one\u2019s discipline.", "Charlotte Aria was vastly inferior to Eun Yuri in this regard. Although she was good at imitating what she was shown, she lacked the pioneering spirit to achieve something by herself.", "It wasn\u2019t that she lacked the desire to improve herself, but every time she tried something new, she got scared and dreaded it.", "Even though Eun Yuri started learning later, given the nature of the two students, it was only natural for the motivated Eun Yuri to pull ahead of Charlotte Aria.", "But that didn\u2019t mean these were poor terms. It wouldn\u2019t be strange for a senior disciple to be jealous of a junior disciple after being surpassed by them. But rather than being jealous, Charlotte Aria was full of admiration for Eun Yuri.", "Roselle had no plans to say anything about this. It wasn\u2019t a bad thing for her two disciples to be on good terms, and Charlotte Aria was an uncompetitive person by nature.", "Right, that was how she usually was.", "So she should have been like that this time as well, but from Charlotte Aria\u2019s inner thoughts, Roselle could feel an electrifying emotion that wasn\u2019t there before.", "She was certain. The Queen of Eva was fiercely burning with a competitive spirit against Eun Yuri.", "\u2018What happened\u2026?\u2019", "It didn\u2019t take long for Roselle to find out why.", "\u2018Seol Jihu.\u2019", "It was because all of Charlotte Aria\u2019s thoughts were pointing in one direction.", "\u2018Maybe\u2026\u2019", "Roselle\u2019s eyes lit up.", "\u201cCharlotte.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d", "She stepped closer, pressed on Charlotte Aria\u2019s plump, baby fat-filled cheeks, and raised her face.", "Roselle spoke quietly with eyes that were full of unknown expectations.", "\u201cListen carefully to what I am about to say.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria widened her eyes and nodded dazedly.", "*", "The eight-Horus-drawn carriage carrying Seol Jihu and Agnes arrived in Eva.", "Agnes expressed her surprise after seeing the imposing building in the middle of the city.", "\u201cLooks like you spent some money.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019d be even more surprised when you find out how many gold coins went into building this place.\u201d", "Seol Jihu grumbled as he cut through the garden filled with the refreshing smell of flowers.", "\u201cKim Hannah was in charge of the design. It turns out she even invited an Alchemist.\u201d", "\u201cMiss Foxy did\u2026? Why an Alchemist?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure, but apparently his help was needed to build the hot springs. Really, I felt like a husband seeing his wife going wild with his credit cards.\u201d", "Of course, this wasn\u2019t a fair statement considering how many gold coins Kim Hannah made for him, but Seol Jihu just couldn\u2019t understand it.", "\u201cHot springs? Ah, Eva is a volcanic region\u2026\u201d", "Agnes\u2019 eyes twinkled as she nodded her head.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve caught my interest. Hot springs that needed a Magician\u2019s help to be built\u2026\u201d", "\u201cBoth hot springs are downstairs, one for men, one for women. You\u2019re free to go whenever. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke plainly as he opened the door.", "\u201cSpeaking of which, you must be tired from the carriage ride. I\u2019ll take you there, so why don\u2019t you jump in the steamy hot spring with me?\u201d", "\u201cCut the bullshit.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips, having been flat out rejected.", "\u201cHaha. Okay, there are plenty of guest rooms, so you can grab whichever one you like. Also\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu paused when he saw the first-floor lobby.", "He couldn\u2019t be blamed. There was a bob-cut woman sprawled on the ground with her arms and legs spread out.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know any Valhalla members who would do something lacking so much in common sense. Even Chohong and Hugo wouldn\u2019t do something like this.", "\u201c\u2026Miss Hoshino Urara?\u201d", "As soon as he called out her name, Hoshino Urara\u2019s upper body shot up. She looked at Seol Jihu and opened her mouth wide enough to show her uvula.", "\u201cOOOOOOH!\u201d", "She then changed her sitting position to a crouch and galloped toward him like a crazy horse. However, her bee-stung pony impression was short-lived.", "\u201cKITAAAAAA\u2014CK!?\u201d", "When she saw the maid standing behind Seol Jihu, she screamed in terror. Flailing her arms and legs in the air, she rolled backward.", "After somehow tumbling around, she fixed her posture and showed a dazed face.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "An indescribably uncomfortable silence hung between the two women.", "The first to act was Hoshino Urara. Her lips trembled before she respectfully got on her knees. She even cupped her hands above her knees.", "Her expression was also calm and tidy. Five seconds was all it took for the crazy woman to transform into a lady of a distinguished family.", "\u201cHave you come back?\u201d", "Hearing that the sharp voice had turned into a calm, silvery voice, Seol Jihu doubted his eyes and ears.", "Hoshino Urara turned\u2026 docile?", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. Thank you for coming. Though this may be a lowly place, please think of it as your home and make yourself comfortable.\u201d", "She bowed politely until her forehead was almost touching the ground.", "Seol Jihu, who was rubbing his eyes in disbelief, slowly turned back. Then, he was surprised once again.", "It was because Agnes was walking forward with a face that clearly said, \u2018God, I hate this.\u2019", "\u201cM-Miss Agnes?\u201d", "\u201cYou said there was a hot spring downstairs?\u201d", "\u201cUm, you should grab a room first.\u201d", "\u201cNo need to guide me. I\u2019ll be fine on my own. Then excuse me.\u201d", "She walked quickly and disappeared.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped.", "THE Agnes was avoiding someone?", "Hoshino Urara waited until Agnes disappeared from sight before shooting up.", "\u201cOppppaa!\u201d", "Screaming like a duck, she grabbed the flinching Seol Jihu\u2019s hands and made a fuss.", "\u201cYou crazy!? Hmm? Why is that person here? Why did you bring her here!!?\u201d", "\u201cF-For of the expedition. It wasn\u2019t easy to invite her, you know.\u201d", "\u201cJeebus\u2014! I\u2019m gonna go crazy! Do you know who that is!? You want to die, Oppa!? You must, right!?\u201d", "\u201cWhy? She\u2019s a great person.\u201d", "\u201cGreat my asssss!\u201d", "Hoshino Urara jumped like she was really going crazy.", "\u201cFuck me, end me, absolutely obliterate me! How can you be so blind?\u201d", "Pointing in the direction Agnes disappeared to, Hoshino Urara shook her hand and muttered with her face up close.", "\u201cYou must not know, Oppa, so I\u2019ll tell ya about it. You ever hear about the Haramark Civil War?\u201d", "\u201cYes, somewhat.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, I was there.\u201d", "\u201cOkay. And?\u201d", "\u201cAnd, you say? Brother, I was there watching! That person captured the enemy organization members, eh! Cut open a dude\u2019s stomach, eh! Yoinked the intestines like a noodle! Then she\u2014\u201d", "Hoshino Urara suddenly cleared her throat, then raised her middle finger and swept past her face. She seemed to be imitating Agnes pushing up her glasses.", "She continued with a grin, \u201cEat! Here! Chew on it properly and swallow it! It\u2019s your subordinate\u2019s organ!

You won\u2019t find a crazier woman anywhere else!\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked taken aback. He wanted to say something, but it didn\u2019t look like she was lying from the terrified expression she had.", "But it was also hard to imagine Agnes, who was the byword of seriousness and solemnity, laughing maniacally, like \u2018Ki\u2014 Kikikiki!\u2019", "\u2018She\u2019s a good person to me.\u2019", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "He looked at Hoshino Urara, who was clattering her teeth nervously, and asked.", "\u201cAnyway, why were you laying in the lobby?\u201d", "\u201cAh, my body recovered, but I couldn\u2019t find Oppa.
