Winter\u2019s Struggle (3)", "content": ["As Kim Hannah guided a person into the reception room, Seol Jihu got up from his seat delightedly.", "The guest was a thin, brown-skinned man wearing a white turban.", "\u201cMister Tong Chai!\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d", "The man was Mister Tong Chai.", "\u201cThis building sure is huge. Are you really the owner of this place?\u201d", "\u201cIt somehow ended up that way.\u201d", "\u201cWell, you distinguished yourself from the rest even when you were in the Neutral Zone. It feels like it was just yesterday that I was completing the missions with you. This is bringing back old memories.\u201d", "The two men sat down around a table and caught up.", "\u201cI was greatly surprised hearing that you personally visited our branch in Eva.\u201d", "\u201cWe needed an intelligence agency in the city.\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t there Red Hwaru? Seeing as how you kept them alive, we thought you would use them to gather information.\u201d", "\u201cThe intelligence group I want is one that will easily encompass a district. Red Hwaru will step down soon and go under Dongchun Merchants.\u201d", "In other words, the Assassination Guild was an organization that fit Seol Jihu\u2019s criteria. A joyful smile spread on Tong Chai\u2019s face.", "\u201cBut still, asking if we would be interested in being in charge of a district. Do you know how shocked the branch head was when he heard that?\u201d", "Tong Chai guffawed, saying that Seol Jihu was just as generous as ever. Seol Jihu also smiled faintly. Just like Tong Chai said, the branch head had quite a face when he heard the news.", "Although the Assassination Guild had branches in all cities, their branch in Eva was no different than a small candy shop. Because the Eva Alliance suppressed them thoroughly, they were only barely managing to sustain themselves.", "Then one day, a golden pumpkin, the size of a house fell from the sky. How could he not be surprised?", "The astonished branch head relayed the message to the guild\u2019s headquarters, telling Seol Jihu to hold on just a moment, and the Assassination Guild HQ rejoiced and accepted the offer with open arms.", "Although they had to agree to the condition that Eva\u2019s branch would be under Valhalla\u2019s influence, that was an obvious thing. Given the scale of the operation, the branch would basically assume the same role as an organization, so there was no reason for them to refuse.", "Just like that, Valhalla and the Assassination Guild formed a cooperative relationship of mutual dependence.", "\u201cThank you for mentioning me. My status rose because of it, and I can finally live standing tall.\u201d", "\u201cThough it\u2019s late, I should thank you too. When the baseless slander was made against us in Haramark, the Assassination Guild was the only place that defended us.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to thank about. We only wrote the truth as is.\u201d", "Tong Chai spoke as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as it sounded. With a mysterious organization clearly responsible for the incident, only an entity with strong backing would be able to publicly issue a rebuttal article.", "In truth, it wasn\u2019t so easy to form a relationship with an organization of the Assassination Guild\u2019s caliber.", "\u201cAh, by the way, can we talk about the task you commissioned us?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve been waiting to hear back.\u201d", "\u201cThen we will begin with the basic info. Eun Yuri, a March 2016 trainee from Area 1. The Neutral Zone back then took part in two different places between the 17th and the 18th, and although Eun Yuri failed to enter Paradise, she was invited by Nur\u2019s White-Haired Witch organization and participated in the 17th\u2019s Neutral Zone.\u201d", "Tong Chai continued without taking a breath in between.", "\u201cShe supposedly did not do anything to stand out during the Tutorial. It was the same in the Neutral Zone. Up until this point, she sounds like a trainee that can be found in any Neutral Zone\u2026 but there is one noteworthy thing.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d", "\u201cThe day the Awakening Chamber opened.\u201d", "Although sandalwood was fragrant even as a seed leaf, Earthlings were different, and the value of trainees could not be determined from just the Tutorial.", "Like Shin Sang-Ah, there were many cases where an Earthling would turn their lives around after obtaining their class.", "\u201cAccording to witness testimony, Eun Yuri was extremely tired after leaving the Awakening Chamber. While she was not sweating, her hair and clothes were drenched, and her legs were shaking profusely as if she was struggling to continue walking.\u201d", "Tong Chai described the situation back then in detail. Seol Jihu rubbed his chin as well.", "\u2018It was hard for me too.\u2019", "Odelette Delphine, who was given the Magician class, said she felt like she was impregnated. However, not everyone shared the same experience. Those with low mana levels came out comparatively unfazed.", "\u201cAlthough there is no way to confirm, we believe Eun Yuri received the Priest or the Magician class.\u201d", "\u201cAnd she abruptly died the day she got her class?\u201d", "\u201cMm, it\u2019s common for trainees to die during the Neutral Zone\u2019s missions, but it isn\u2019t as if there aren\u2019t strange points. Think about it. Once the trainees receive their class, they form teams and challenge a higher difficulty mission.\u201d", "\u201cYes, we did the same.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, we have to consider the fact that Eun Yuri did not have teammates before her awakening, but what is strange is that she died that night challenging a Normal-difficulty mission alone.\u201d", "It would be a different story if she were a Warrior, which were a dime a dozen. A Magician or a Priest were highly desired even by Paradise\u2019s veterans. As long as she revealed her class, every team would have lined up to recruit her.", "Tong Chai took a small pause before continuing.", "\u201cWe tried to contact the Earthlings who served as the manager and instructors at that time. We managed to find an involved party.\u201d", "\u201cOh? Who?\u201d", "\u201cShe participated as the Neutral Zone\u2019s instructor.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d", "\u201cI asked, but she set two conditions.\u201d", "Tong Chai continued lightheartedly.", "\u201cThe first is to see Valhalla\u2019s representative and talk to him directly.\u201d", "\u201cDirectly?\u201d", "\u201cShe seemed hesitant to let others know. Furthermore, she said she does not know the whole truth, only something that she found suspicious. In other words, she cannot guarantee that her information is the truth.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What is the second condition?\u201d", "\u201cShe asked for 20 silver coins in exchange for the info. Though she called her info a rough guess, she said it was a fair price given that she heard and experienced them herself.\u201d", "10,100,000 won. Though it seemed a little expensive for a few words, Seol Jihu could easily pay that amount.", "\u201cWhat do you think, Mister Tong Chai?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not really credible, but if you have time, I think it will be good to meet and talk to her.\u201d", "\u201cCan I know why you say that?\u201d", "\u201cBecause this person might not be who you expect. Of course, in your perspective, Valhalla Representative.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head in curiosity, but Tong Chai only laughed.", "\u201cI apologize, but I cannot reveal her identity until you give the confirmation that you will meet her. For organizations dealing with intelligence, trust is akin to life.\u201d", "Seol Jihu clicked his tongue.", "\u201cI guess there\u2019s no other choice then. When can I meet her?\u201d", "Tong Chai grinned.", "\u201cIf you\u2019d like, today.\u201d", "*", "Just like Tong Chai said, the mysterious involved person visited Valhalla that night.", "Seol Jihu, who was waiting alone in the reception room, saw Marcel Ghionea guiding a beautiful woman inside. Judging by her tall height, blonde-hair, and Western appearance, she looked to be European.", "\u201cHello\u2026\u201d", "Hearing her somewhat timid greeting, Seol Jihu replied with a bright smile.", "\u201cWelcome. I\u2019m Seol Jihu. And you must be\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYes, as you must have already heard, I\u2019m Evangeline Tonya.\u201d", "Evangeline Tonya.", "He was suspicious when he heard the family name, but as he thought, she was Evangeline Rose\u2019s younger sister.", "Hearing Evangeline Rose\u2019s name again made him feel a little strange. Ever since he came to Eva, he was getting involved in things related to her either directly or indirectly.", "She wasn\u2019t even alive as she had died in the Banquet.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would ask to see me directly. It might be awkward for you, after all.\u201d", "\u201cIf you are talking about Evangeline disbanding, I\u2019m perfectly fine with it.\u201d", "Tonya said quietly.", "\u201cIn fact, I want to thank you for it. Though it\u2019s a shame to see my older sister\u2019s organization disappear, that\u2019s a hundred times better than seeing it get dirtied. I\u2019m especially happy with Jung Sua losing her position. I\u2019d like to give you a standing ovation for that. Bravo.\u201d", "Seol Jihu wouldn\u2019t blame her if she resented Valhalla, but it didn\u2019t sound like she was hostile toward them at all.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d", "Then, Seol Jihu suddenly tilted his head.", "\u201cUm\u2026 have I seen you before\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cYou might have seen me fleetingly during the Banquet.\u201d", "\u201cThe Banquet\u2026 Ah, in Stage 2.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Tonya smiled feebly.", "\u201cUnni sent me out in exchange for going into the Plaza of Sacrifice for reconnaissance.\u201d", "\u201cYes, what a shame. She\u2019s doing well though, right?\u201d", "Hearing this, Tonya\u2019s complexion became noticeably darker.", "After a moment of silence, she said in a barely audible voice.", "\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d", "\u201cUnni committed suicide on Earth immediately after she died in the Banquet.\u201d", "Seol Jihu doubted his ears.", "\u201cIt was my fault.\u201d", "Tonya bit her lips and scowled.", "\u201cI know it\u2019s an excuse, but I never thought Unni would commit suicide. She was an outstanding person. I thought she would clear the stage like a walk in the park and return home. Just like always.\u201d", "The edges of her eyelids reddened as well.", "\u201cAlthough I hurried back home after stage 2 ended and heard the news, but\u2026\u201d", "Eventually, she sniffled and covered her face with her hands.", "\u201cIt was a nightmare. The house reeked, her feet were hanging in midair, her tongue was out all the way to her chin\u2026\u201d", "She began to weep, unable to finish her recollection.", "Seol Jihu became speechless. Evangeline Rose had hung herself?", "Though he found it hard to believe, he didn\u2019t think Tonya was lying, judging by how agonized she was.", "\u201cI knew Unni was overly obsessed with Paradise. I should have gone back to Earth as soon as I left the Banquet just to be safe\u2026\u201d", "Excessive obsession.", "Hearing this phrase, Seol Jihu\u2019s heart sank. He opened his mouth with an awkward look.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d", "Tonya wiped her tears and shook her head.", "\u201cI\u2019m actually happy that you asked. Other than Charlotte Aria-nim, no one asked what happened to Unni on Earth\u2026 cough.\u201d", "Tonya suddenly coughed, then shut her eyes. Seol Jihu patiently waited.", "\u201c\u2026Excuse me.\u201d", "Only after a long while did Tonya seem to have calmed down a bit. She spoke while breathing roughly.", "\u201cBefore I answer, I want to reaffirm the conditions I made.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, I remember it well.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took out 20 silver coins and placed them on the table.", "\u201cAll you have to do is answer a few questions and go back with the reward.\u201d", "Tonya relaxed. She finally looked ready to talk.", "Seol Jihu spoke straightforwardly.", "\u201cIs Eun Yuri\u2019s death related to some kind of tampering?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d", "Tonya replied calmly.", "\u201cBut as someone who was involved, I can say with 90 percent certainty that, that is the case.\u201d", "\u201cBut you aren\u2019t completely sure.\u201d", "\u201cNo. I only did as I was told. I wasn\u2019t told what was going on in the background.\u201d", "\u2018As she was told?\u2019", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows. Tonya sighed.", "\u201cUnni\u2019s personality was like that. She didn\u2019t trust others easily and always tried to do things alone.\u201d", "\u201cWait, by Unni, you mean\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYes, I\u2019m talking about my older sister, Evangeline Rose.\u201d", "Tonya cleared her throat.", "\u201cShe must have entrusted me with this task because she trusted me as her young sister. It wasn\u2019t anything important though.\u201d", "\u201cYou make it sound like Miss Evangeline Rose made contact with Eun Yuri for the purpose of tampering.\u201d", "\u201cI won\u2019t defend her.\u201d", "Tonya said in a gloomy tone.", "\u201cTampering was something that everyone did back then. Although it is no longer possible, the White-Haired Witch organization was suspected on multiple occasions to have tampered with the Neutral Zone\u2019s trainees.\u201d", "In a way, this was unexpected. However, Seol Jihu quickly regained his calm.", "\u201cWhat role did Miss Tonya play in the Neutral Zone?\u201d", "\u201cI worked in the cafeteria. Many trainees came in and out every day.\u201d", "\u201cYou said Miss Evangeline Rose entrusted you with a task. What task was it?\u201d", "\u201cJust a minor matter. She asked me to secretly hand Eun Yuri a message. Because she came near the end of the dining hours, it was nothing difficult.\u201d", "\u201cDid you see the contents of the message?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Unni strongly emphasized that I do not look at it.\u201d", "Just like Tonya said, she had the evidence to back her conjecture. Seol Jihu asked another question.", "\u201cWhy do you think Miss Evangeline Rose was interested in an insignificant trainee like Eun Yuri?\u201d", "Tonya went silent for a little while before saying.", "\u201cI think it was because of her discerning eye.\u201d", "\u201cDiscerning eye?\u201d", "\u201cUnni was an Archer. It isn\u2019t strange for her to have a discerning eye ability. But I would like to tell you that Unni\u2019s senses were very special.\u201d", "\u201cShe was good at recognizing major talents. Was it something like that?\u201d", "\u201cMm, I don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d", "Tonya tilted her head.", "\u201cHow should I say this, rather than seeing people or objects and categorizing them, she could pick out whether they were good or bad\u2026 I guess you could say she had good intuition.\u201d", "\u201cIntuition, huh.\u201d", "\u201cShe was like that ever since she was little. But her senses developed even more when she entered Paradise. It isn\u2019t just once or twice that we benefited by trusting her intuition.\u2019", "\u2018An Innate Ability!\u2019", "Seol Jihu naturally thought this after hearing Tonya\u2019s explanation. He couldn\u2019t deny the possibility. After all, he himself had a similar ability.", "Although Tonya said she never thought her older sister would die, Seol Jihu felt like he knew why. He had also almost gotten himself killed after seeing the Attention Required color and rushing in.", "\u2018Maybe she trusted her intuition too much.\u2019", "The Nine Eyes was also a matter of choice and probability. It was not omnipotent.", "\u201cSo because of those two reasons, you\u2019re saying that\u2026\u201d", "\u201cNo, there\u2019s one more.\u201d", "Tonya spoke.", "\u201cAll I know for certain is that Eun Yuri died shortly after I gave her the message. I do not know what happened in between. But, I was suspicious of Unni back then, and because I was so curious, I asked her.\u201d", "\u201cBased on what you\u2019ve told me so far, I doubt she said anything.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re half-right and half-wrong. She normally wouldn\u2019t have said anything to me, but that day, she actually said one thing.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d", "\u201cShe said, \u2018I knew my intuition wasn\u2019t wrong.\u2019\u201d", "Seol Jihu unwittingly stopped breathing.", "\u201cShe also looked really happy. Unni limited revealing her emotions, so I remember it clearly.\u201d", "Tonya spoke with clarity.", "Seol Jihu gulped. Although there was no physical evidence, the circumstantial evidence made it clear that there was something between Evangeline Rose and Eun Yuri.", "\u2018It really is a fair price.\u2019", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t think the 20 silvers were wasted at all. However, what she said was also circumstantial evidence that could not be verified.", "20 silver coins were the perfect price, and that\u2019s what made it more credible.", "\u201cWith that, I told you everything I know. Do you have any more questions\u2026?\u201d", "Hearing Tonya, Seol Jihu snapped out of his daze.", "\u201cNo, that\u2019s good enough.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYes, you can leave. Thank you for your assistance.\u201d", "\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m glad to have helped.\u201d", "Seol Jihu pushed the money pouch on the table forward.", "Tonya bowed before taking the pouch and getting up.", "*", "Seol Jihu remained in his seat even after Tonya left.", "\u2018Eun Yuri, Eun Yuri\u2026\u2019", "There was only one reason Seol Jihu was thinking so hard. He wasn\u2019t sure Eun Yuri was someone worth bringing by using a Divine Wish.", "Seol Jihu was also human. He didn\u2019t want to spend the contribution points he worked so hard to gather carelessly.", "There was less than a fifty percent chance. If she was a Priest and not a Magician, then he really would have wasted his time, effort, and money.", "Even if she was a Magician, he would feel bitter if her aptitude was subpar.", "He would feel much better if he could find Eun Yuri and view her through his Nine Eyes, but unfortunately, General Observation did not work properly on Earth.", "He had tested it out before on a few random passersby, and perhaps because they had not gone through the Tutorial, he could not see any Status Windows.", "It wasn\u2019t as if he could make judgments based on her color either.", "\u2018Let\u2019s suppose we invite her. What are the potential benefits\u2026?\u2019", "It was then. Just as he was in deep thought\u2026", "\u2018Eh?\u2019", "A single thought flashed through Seol Jihu\u2019s mind like a ray of light.", "\u2018Wait.\u2019", "His eyes widened, and his jaw dropped.", "\u201cRight\u2026 Why didn\u2019t I think of this\u2026?\u201d", "Murmuring to himself with a dazed look\u2026 Tang! He slammed down on the table and got up.", "\u201cArgh, damn it, Kim Hannah!\u201d", "Then, he quickly left the building, blaming Kim Hannah, who wasn\u2019t even present, for some reason."]}
