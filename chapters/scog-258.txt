Fox, O Fox (4)", "content": ["Yang Yang.", "He was the head of an organization that made up the Eva alliance, an Earthling that represented one of the four Weaks of Eva\u2019s forces, and a close friend of Omar Garcia. This was all thanks to Yang Yang\u2019s creed of doing anything if paid properly and Omar Garcia\u2019s interests often coinciding.", "Actually, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that it was Omar Garcia who raised Yang Yang\u2019s authority and elevated him to be the representative of the 4 Weaks.", "Omar Garcia called him today for a similar reason.", "\"I originally didn\u2019t intend to go this far.\u201d", "Omar Garcia calmly spoke.", "\"Carpe Diem, Seol Jihu, and the Triads. It didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea to draw them in as allies at first. I considered kindly forgetting the past and even gifting them the territory that the Royal Pattaya was in charge of. It looked like it\u2019d make a magnificent picture.\u201d", "Yang Yang smirked.", "\"You\u2019re too generous.\u201d", "\"It\u2019s not too bad to gain a figurehead after all. That\u2019s what I thought\u2026 but I\u2019ve been getting second thoughts lately.\u201d", "\"They\u2019re making too much of a mess. There have been a lot of complaints within the alliance because of them.\u201d", "\"There\u2019s a limit to everything. Bluntly put, they must view us as pushovers. Otherwise\u2026 Tsk.\u201d", "Omar Garcia clicked his tongue and continued in a subdued voice.", "\"What do you think?\u201d", "\"Are you planning to drive them out?\u201d", "\"The correct phrase would be to serve them retribution. In any case, it seems that I\u2019ll need to borrow your helping hand this time. You won\u2019t be disappointed with the payment.\u201d", "\"I\u2019ll have to refuse, sir.\"", "Yang Yang flatly declined without hearing the rest of what Omar Garcia had to say. Omar Garcia\u2019s eyebrows twitched.", "\"I wasn\u2019t done talking.\u201d", "\"Please don\u2019t demand ridiculous requests. I\u2019m not that eager to walk into my own grave.\u201d", "\"Yang Yang, I\u2019m not asking you to declare war on them. You just need to give them a taste of their own medicine.\u201d", "\"That sounds like the same thing to me. What do you expect me to do when even the alliance can\u2019t do anything to them\u2026\u201d", "\"What if Seol Jihu left Eva?\u201d", "Yang Yang\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "\"\u2026Excuse me?\"", "\"The royal family lent us a hand. Carpe Diem is going to dispatch several members to complete an escort mission to the Federation.\u201d", "\"So in other words\u2026\"", "Yang Yang suspiciously asked.", "\"You want me to ambush them while their main force is absent?\u201d", "\"Now we\u2019re talking.\u201d", "Omar Garcia smiled as he continued.", "\"You don\u2019t need to think things too hard. Quietly sneak attack them early in the morning and then quietly retreat after you\u2019re done. Burn down the entire area, building and all, so there won\u2019t be a trace of evidence left.\u201d", "\"Well that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done, but\u2026\u201d", "Yang Yang pondered. It theoretically wasn\u2019t an impossible task.", "There would be only non-combatant High Rankers remaining if Carpe Diem\u2019s main force left. Granted, there would be an Executor, but it was an open secret that Seo Yuhui lost her ability as an aftermath of the war. Since there were only one or two low-levels excluding her\u2026", "He had dismissed the thought as a ridiculous notion at first, but after reaching that point in thought, a perverse desire arose within Yang Yang.", "'The Daughter of Luxuria\u2026.'", "A flower that even Sung Shihyun failed to pluck. He would be lying if he said it didn\u2019t tug at his interests.", "\"I have a few questions I want to ask.\u201d", "\"Go ahead.\"", "\"How are you planning to deal with the Triads? Unless they\u2019re fools, they\u2019ll definitely request protection from them.\u201d", "\"I knew you\u2019d asked. Actually, I secretly met with the Triads not a while ago.\u201d", "Omar Garcia spoke as if it was all within his expectations.", "\"I noticed that the Triads had always bided their time, restraining themselves. So, I spoke with them out of a hunch, and my guesses were spot on.\u201d", "\"Is that true?\"", "\"You\u2019ll know when you see it.\"", "\"Don't be like that and please tell me. Aren\u2019t I the one who\u2019ll be doing the work? I need to know the situation to come up with a plan.\u201d", "Seeing Yang Yang show great interest, Omar Garcia relented and proceeded to explain.", "\"It\u2019s simple. The Triads agreed to send four to five hired-thugs.\u201d", "\"Why thugs\u2026\"", "\"Listen. What we\u2019ll do is\u2026.\u201d", "This was Omar Garcia\u2019s scheme:", "Hao Win would send hired thugs dressed like members of the Triads and have them pick a fight with Ochoa Cartel members at a pub.", "\"Brawls at a pub is a normal occurrence, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "\"Sure.\"", "\"It would be nothing special at first. However, once someone takes out a weapon, it can\u2019t be treated as a trivial fight anymore.\u201d", "\"Are you purposely intending to stir up a scene?\u201d", "\"Yes. We\u2019re going to send members from our cartel and the Dongchun Merchants. Of course, make sure you\u2019re present with members of your organization too. Send just enough to prove you were there at the scene.\u201d", "Just like that, all the organizations under the Eva Alliance would rush to the pub, followed by the members of the Triad that would be guarding the Carpe Diem building.", "Yang Yang scoffed hearing the strategy.", "\"Is there really a need to go this far?\u201d", "\"This guy. We have to take the Triad\u2019s position into account. Reputation is a factor that can\u2019t be ignored for organizations.\u201d", "Things would be too suspicious if the Triads conveniently withdrew all their members in a timely manner without any reason. That was why they would create a situation that would \u2018force\u2019 them to abandon the building\u2019s security.", "That wasn\u2019t all.", "The Eva Alliance would be the first one to be suspected if they launched an attack against Carpe Diem. However, if they created a scene by fighting against the Triads, they could create an alibi for themselves. Furthermore, it would be difficult to identify exactly who was present when the brawl happened.", "\"Once the situation is set up, the royal family\u2019s attention will be focused on the pub. You take that moment to ambush Carpe Diem. You just need to give me a call once you\u2019re done with the task.\u201d", "\"What happens then?\u201d", "\"Hao Win and I will appear when the situation escalates to the verge of exploding. Then I\u2019ll apologize first, ending the situation, and we all go home.\u201d", "\"I understand what you mean. But what do we do when Carpe Diem\u2019s main force returns? Do we stay still?\u201d", "\u201cWhat can they do if they can\u2019t find the culprit? There\u2019s no lack of Earthlings that were dissatisfied with how they destroyed the red-light district. We just need to push the blame. Everything will settle down in time.\u201d", "\"Well\u2026 Judging by their actions up to now, they might try to raze us down to the ground\u2026\u201d", "\"Then we have to thank them instead. They\u2019d be giving us justification to take action. After all, internal conflict is forbidden within the city without legitimate reasons. If that happens, it won\u2019t be just the Eva Alliance but the royal family that will move as well. We\u2019ve already talked things through.\u201d", "Yang Yang couldn\u2019t help marvel at Omar Garcia\u2019s attention to minute details as he smoothly answered his worries.", "\"You\u2019ve already thought that far. You\u2019re really determined this time, aren\u2019t you?\u201d", "\"There\u2019s a limit to my patience. I\u2019ve already shown them mercy. Now I have to show them that I\u2019m not someone they can trifle with.\u201d", "Yang Yang nodded his head, agreeing with him.", "\"So how is it? Are you confident now?\u201d", "\"Well\u2026 If everything\u2019s as you\u2019ve said, then it\u2019s more than possible. You\u2019ve already laid out a mat for me.\u201d", "\"Good! Then\u2014\"", "\"But.\"", "Yang Yang interrupted him and lifted three fingers.", "\"I\u2019ll do it if you listen to three of my requests.\u201d", "\"\u2026Really. This guy.\u201d", "\"It\u2019s nothing other than making things clear.\u201d", "Yang Yang snickered hearing Omar Garcia grumble.", "\"First, I\u2019ll carry out the mission only after I confirm Seol Jihu has left Eva. In other words, I get to decide when to execute the plan.\u201d", "\"It doesn\u2019t matter.\"", "\"The second is on similar lines too. I\u2019ll commence only when the Triads completely leave the building.\u201d", "\"That\u2019s a given.\"", "\"And for the third\u2026 I\u2019d like to borrow a High Ranker.\u201d", "Omar Garcia gazed at him instead of immediately replying. Anger flashed across his face before quickly disappearing.", "\"\u2026You\u2019ve changed a lot too. Where did your bravado of doing anything for money go?\u201d", "\"I don\u2019t want to die. Of course, I\u2019ll be selecting only the elites of my organization to go with me, but don\u2019t I also need to leave some at the pub for our alibi? Also, there\u2019s no guarantee that all of Carpe Diem\u2019s main force will be leaving.\u201d", "\"You want insurance, huh. That\u2019s good. I\u2019ll send Oliver Rogers with you.\u201d", "\"No. I\u2019d like to take Noah Freya-nim.\u201d", "\"What?\"", "\"If Oliver Rogers-nim comes\u2026 We\u2019ll be forced to share.\u201d", "\"Share?\"", "Omar Garcia questioned him with an inquiring face, but soon sent him a strange gaze.", "\"Now that I think about it\u2026.\"", "\"I\u2019ve researched a little on my own, and there\u2019s Miss Foxy and another pretty girl. But above all, there\u2019s the Daughter of Luxuria\u2026\u201d", "Yang Yang trailed off his words and giggled. It was a peal of dirty and perverse laughter.", "\"Don\u2019t say no. It\u2019s not an opportunity that comes often.\u201d", "\"Jeez, fine, do whatever you want.\u201d", "Omar Garcia guffawed.", "\"It\u2019s good to have some fun if you\u2019re going to kill them anyway, but don\u2019t screw up.\u201d", "\"Don\u2019t worry, you know my personality. I\u2019ll quickly kill everyone that needs to be killed and get out after burning the whole place down, building and all. And then I\u2019ll drag her out and\u2026 Hehe!\u201d", "As if he was excited just thinking about it, Yang Yang\u2019s face became filled with lust. Omar Garcia\u2019s eyes also sparkled.", "\"I\u2019m suddenly beginning to envy you.\u201d", "\"Feel free to drop by when the work is done. We\u2019ll probably still be in the basement sharing a heated moment\u2026 You might even have to wait in line!\u201d", "\"Look at this guy talk. Good! It\u2019ll be a scene worth watching.\u201d", "\"I\u2019m already getting aroused. There\u2019s Miss Foxy, too, but doing the Paradise\u2019s legend with my very own hands\u2026 Hehehehe!\u201d", "Dark laughter rang out of the room for a long time.", "*", "Meanwhile, a tripartite talk was underway at the Carpe Diem building.", "There were two notable points.", "One was that Seol Jihu was nowhere in sight and the other was that one of the parties was participating through a communication crystal.", "There was no way Seol Jihu was aware of this since Kim Hannah convened the meeting in secret while he was busy preparing for the escort mission to the Federation.", "\"Hmm\u2026\"", "Jang Maldong murmured to himself while sitting on the couch with a disapproving face.", "\"Master.\"", "Kim Hannah spoke with a firm voice.", "\"I know what you\u2019re thinking about this as. But Jihu needs to be punished at least once.\u201d", "\"\u2026\"", "\"That guy doesn\u2019t even have a clue as to what he\u2019s done wrong this time.\u201d", "\"\u2026I don\u2019t really know why we need to go this far.\u201d", "Jang Maldong spoke in a tired voice.", "\"Jihu is a boy without a sense of entitlement. You can tell by watching him unable to grasp how great of a feat it was when he took down Undying Diligence.\u201d", "\"I know. He doesn\u2019t have a bad personality.\u201d", "Kim Hannah continued.", "\"And as you said, he doesn't have a sense of entitlement. But he harbors a victim mentality.\u201d", "\"Victim mentality?\"", "Jang Maldong\u2019s gaze grew sharp. His expression plainly asked whether she was done talking.", "However, Kim Hannah did not falter and resolutely continued.", "\"Since you\u2019ve been with him for a long time, even you must be aware that Jihu is excessively immersed in Paradise. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that he\u2019s treating this place equal to his own life.\u201d", "\"\u2026\u201d", "\"He suddenly becomes a different person altogether when certain incidents happen. This was the first time I\u2019ve personally witnessed it, but you must have seen it a couple of times already.\u201d", "Jang Maldong shut his mouth at those words.", "Because of how he doted on Seol Jihu, he wanted to defend Seol Jihu like he normally did, but\u2026 his mouth did not open easily.", "It was because Jang Maldong had also seen and felt the same way several times before.", "\"He\u2019s gone too far, especially after coming to Eva\u2026 Jihu\u2019s probably thinking of every Earthling besides himself as potential threats to Paradise.\u201d", "\"Even if he\u2019s thinking that way, he\u2019s not entirely wrong.\u201d", "\"You\u2019re right, he\u2019s not.

Sensing the serious atmosphere, the bystanders quickly retreated and the gap they created was filled with members from both parties.", "Early in the morning, while the city\u2019s attention was drawn by the commotion at the pub, an unknown group rapidly took action.", "Under the cover of darkness, they stealthily moved without a sound and surrounded their destination, the Carpe Diem building.", "*", "Meanwhile, Seol Jihu was fully concentrating on his mission without a clue of what was taking place in Eva.
