What made him stand out from other Dwarves was that he didn\u2019t have a beard and also that his eyes were completely white.", "\u201cFor the record, he is the one who invented Thunder. He was born blind, but his craftsmanship is a league above that of any other Dwarf. He\u2019s a master among masters if you will.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was surprised hearing that he invented Thunder.", "Vidalif smiled and reached his hand toward Seol Jihu.", "As Seol Jihu carefully took his hand, he felt the hard calluses on Vidalif\u2019s hand and a strong grip.", "Shortly afterward, Vidalif let go of Seol Jihu\u2019s hand and took out a box with a respectful attitude.", "\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d", "\u201cTake it.\u201d", "Gabriel smiled.", "\u201cThis is our gift to the hero who sweated blood and tears for us. Vidalif made it himself, so you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d", "Unlike his mouth, his body was honest. Seol Jihu was already holding the box in his hands.", "An item made by the Dwarf King who was said to be a master among masters. How could he not be excited?", "\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll take good care of it.\u201d", "Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to thank them. Vidalif replied with a lukewarm smile.", "\u201cMoving on, this here is the general in command of the Sky Fairies.\u201d", "\u201cHello, I\u2019m Taihi Ingraria. It is my greatest honor to thank you on behalf of my race. We cannot thank you enough for reviving the World Tree and even liberating Lord Ophin\u00fc Odor.\u201d", "The Sky Fairy with an alluring neckline curtsied elegantly and spoke in a slightly flushed, silvery voice.", "The clarity of her voice made it pleasant to hear, and the snow-white skin tone and her beautiful eyes gave off the feeling of striking beauty.", "\u201cWe should be thanking our benefactor according to our customs, but unfortunately we are all out of Elixeers\u2026\u201d", "As Taihi placed her hand on her chest in a show of apology, Seol Jihu quickly shook his head.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m already grateful for the one you gave before.\u201d", "\u201cNo, we can\u2019t possibly forget about this matter like that. So I was thinking\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop there?\u201d", "A sour voice cut in.", "Yuirel was picking her ear with an apathetic look.", "Taihi furrowed her brows.", "\u201cStop what?\u201d", "\u201cDo I even need to explain? You were probably going to ask him to marry you and receive the Blessing of the Spirits. Can you be more obvious? Why don\u2019t you think about your age a bit?\u201d", "\u201cWhat was shtat? When did I say it had to be mwe?\u201d", "Taihi got angry.", "But not caring for it in the slightest, Yuirel\u2019s amber eyes curled charmingly and turned to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cListen, friend. If you can get the same effect anyway, why not choose me?\u201d", "\u201cAren\u2019t you saying the same thwing!?\u201d", "\u201cShut up for a bit. Friend, you should decide well. We Cave Fairies are fundamentally different from Sky Fairies. We\u2019re honest and pure, unlike the lustful, messy race that enjoys being captured by Orcs and falling into depravity. I\u2019m a bit of a romanticist myself.\u201d", "\u201cWhat was shtat? Did you just call us a lustful race that enjoys falling into deprawity!?\u201d", "\u201cStop slurring your speech. And please, doesn\u2019t history prove that I\u2019m right?\u201d", "\u201cSo you want to play this gwame?\u201d", "The two Fairies grew tense.", "White Tiger, the Beastman King, who was watching from the sidelines, spoke while rubbing his chin.", "\u201cCome to think of it, I have a daughter myself\u2026 She is still in her infancy, but our race normally grows quickly. How about it? If you wait a month, she will be more than ready to\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu closed his eyes.", "Just dealing with Teresa was hard enough. Now, he even had more to handle on his hands.", "Not to mention, he couldn\u2019t understand just what they would benefit from marrying him. Of course, this was only because he had never put much thought into their culture or the value of his position.", "\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d", "In the end, Gabriel couldn\u2019t bear to watch any longer and intervened.", "\u201cDid we invite Representative Seol today to find him a marriage partner?\u201d", "Knowing the hidden meaning in her words, the other leaders fell silent.", "\u2018Ehew,\u2019 Gabriel sighed and then changed the topic.", "\u201cI know you must be tired of hearing this, but I want to thank you again. You performed fantastically. We wouldn\u2019t be here arguing if you didn\u2019t perform above and beyond our wildest imaginations.\u201d", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if I was alone.\u201d", "\u201cBut you were the one who planned and executed the expedition. And unlike the time with Undying Diligence, you were able to retrieve Temperance\u2019s divinity after exterminating Raging Temperance. Words cannot describe just how incredible that is.\u201d", "Gabriel smiled brightly, then clapped her hands.", "\u201cAnd with that, the Parasites lost the great war, and peace returned to Paradise\u2026 I would kill for such a happy ending, but unfortunately, you should know that we aren\u2019t anywhere close to that, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded silently.", "The Parasites had suffered a tremendous defeat, but they were not eliminated completely. The Parasite Queen was still alive, and so were most of the Army Commanders.", "Although they shouldn\u2019t be able to recover in a short period of time, the nature of parasites meant they would recoup the numbers they lost relatively quickly.", "\u201cMoreover, the fact that Sung Shihyun defected to the Parasites is something we cannot ignore. To be honest, it was incredibly shocking.\u201d", "\u2018Right, there was that guy too.\u2019 Seol Jihu grimaced.", "\u201cBut a victory is still a victory. The Parasites will need some time to recover, and we need to make use of this time as much as possible.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you think about attacking the Parasites?\u201d", "\u201cYou mean invading the Empire?\u201d", "\u201cYes, that\u2019s where the Queen is, right? The Parasites should be at their weakest right now, so\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s our best chance to attack\u2026 Is that what you want to say? Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t such a good idea. For three reasons.\u201d", "Gabriel took a brief pause, then raised her index, middle, and ring fingers.", "\u201cFirst, as much as the Parasites have weakened, we have weakened too. Do you know that the two Spirit Lords, the five Spirit Kings, and all Spirits were reverse summoned because of the Queen?\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "\u201cThey returned to the Spirit Realm, but we\u2019ll need some time before we can summon them again.\u201d", "Gabriel cleared her throat and continued.", "\u201cSecond, the Empire is the Parasites\u2019 territory.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOne of the biggest reasons we triumphed in this war was the presence of the World Tree. It blocks the Parasites\u2019 infestation and greatly limits the Parasites\u2019 power, including the Queen\u2019s and the Army Commanders\u2019. But, the World Tree\u2019s influence only reaches this surrounding area.\u201d", "In other words, they would not be able to receive the World Tree\u2019s blessing in the Empire\u2019s territory.", "\u201cThe moment we enter the Empire, our positions will reverse. We will be afflicted by all sorts of disadvantageous effects. The Parasite Queen and the Army Commanders will be able to use their full power as well, so that\u2019s something we need to consider. If you can\u2019t quite wrap your mind around it, just think of them as having four or five corrupted World Trees.\u201d", "Seol Jihu groaned unwittingly.", "Four or five corrupted World Trees?", "Just imagining it gave him a gloomy feeling.", "\u201cAs for the third and final reason\u2026\u201d", "Gabriel began to speak carefully.", "\u201cIf we decide to bear the previous two conditions and attack, it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed that it will need to be an all-out attack\u2026 Mmm, I\u2019ll be straightforward. Even though the situation is a lot better than in the past and is continually getting better, if you ask me whether humans will really agree to an all-out attack, then I\u2019m going to have to say no. For now, anyway.\u201d", "Seol Jihu became lost for words.", "He couldn\u2019t refute her statement.", "Even in this war, Eva and Haramark were the only cities that helped fully. The other three cities that participated were only saving face, and two cities did not even participate.", "Moreover, the way Earthlings viewed Paradise had yet to change.", "\u201cSo rather than attacking the Empire, which has a high probability of failing, I suggest we do something more worthwhile.\u201d", "\u201cSomething more worthwhile?\u201d", "\u201cYep. Something that will benefit us both. I\u2019ll be straight. I think you should use the time that this war bought us to regroup humanity.\u201d", "Regroup humanity.", "Seol Jihu became dazed hearing something he didn\u2019t expect at all.", "\u201cDo you want to at least hear me out?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded quickly.", "Gabriel grinned and turned her gaze to where the Dwarf King was sitting.", "Soon, the smiling, white-eyed old man, Vidalif, opened his wrinkly mouth."]}
