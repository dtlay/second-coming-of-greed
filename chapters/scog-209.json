That was the only information he could gather at that moment.", "In the next moment, Marcel Ghionea chased the target with narrowed eyes and prepared himself to pull the trigger.", "However, Teresa\u2019s eyes simultaneously widened.", "\u201cWait!\u201d", "Along with a high-pitched scream, Teresa quickly extended her arm out.", "Drrk!", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea muttered in a fluster after firing about four bolts.

The bolts all flew off their intended mark.", "\u201cYou\u2014!\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea grit his teeth and looked back at Teresa. It was then.", "\u201cUeh!?\u201d", "A child-like voice suddenly rang out from above.", "The figure crossing through the air flailed before falling down.

Judging by its cute little hands and its tiny feet, it was a child without a doubt.", "The problem was this.", "\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d", "Chohong blurted out as if she lost interest, then walked up.", "\u201cMiss Chohong! Wait! Don\u2019t just walk up\u2026!\u201d", "Teresa stopped Chohong, but Chohong continued walking. The groaning child must have felt her presence as it looked back in a startle.", "\u201cH-Human! Here too\u2026!\u201d", "Despair filled the child\u2019s small beaded eyes.", "\u201cNo, no\u2026!\u201d", "The child flailed around, trying to get away as much as possible.", "\u2018Can\u2019t she just get up and run?\u2019", "She must have been too shocked to think rationally. The child looked rather pitiful, but Chohong sauntered up uncaringly. After glancing at the child\u2019s face and butt, a light flickered in her eyes.", "\u201cHa! Ears and tail?\u201d", "Right, to everyone\u2019s surprise, the child\u2019s ears were covered in soft, cushiony hair, and a thick, brush-like tail was attached to her pants.", "\u201cIya~ Who would have thought I\u2019d see a Beastman here?\u201d", "Chohong exclaimed in awe before grabbing the child, who was fumbling around on the ground.", "\u201cUwah! Uwaaaaah!\u201d", "The Beastman child struggled in fear, having been pulled up by her leg.", "\u201cArgh, stay still!\u201d", "Because the child was resisting harder than she expected, Chohong furrowed her brows and reached out. Once she grabbed her stiff tail tight, the Beastman child stopped resisting instantly.", "\u201cAwuuu\u2026.\u201d", "She shuddered as though she had just been electrocuted before sagging down. Chohong chuckled like an idiot.", "\u201cI heard the tail is the weak point of some Beastmen.

She sounded extremely angry. Chohong didn\u2019t know what to do seeing the Beastman child crying in her hand.", "\u201cTake your hand off her tail! Now!\u201d", "Teresa quickly ran forward and snatched the child out of Chohong\u2019s hand.", "\u201cSorry, did that scare you? It\u2019s okay now, alright?\u201d", "She hugged the child gently and consoled her, but the child was already in a state of panic and did not show any sign of calming down.", "Biting her lip softly, Teresa looked back at Kazuki and asked.", "\u201cMister Kazuki, where are we exactly? Did we cross the border?\u201d", "Kazuki looked around, then replied.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure. In a broad sense, we should be at the very center of the border region. We haven\u2019t crossed the border yet though.\u201d", "\u201cSo we\u2019re on the human side of the border region.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Kazuki replied with clarity.", "Teresa nibbled on her lower lip.", "\u201cWhat happened? Why is this child\u2026\u201d", "She blurred the end of her speech before looking up at everyone and shouting.", "\u201cI think we should stop for a bit. First\u2014\u201d", "\u201cPrincess.\u201d", "Kazuki cut her off.

As this was his first time seeing one, he had been staring at the child in a daze. He collected his mind before speaking.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll take a short break.\u201d", "The expedition team took a break near the carriages. Kazuki stood guard, while the others gathered together and watched Teresa and the Beastman child.", "Teresa had taken the Beastman child and walked a good distance away. Given how anxious she was, Teresa decided it would be better to get her away from other humans.", "\u201cBeastman\u2026 and a child Beastman, at that. Who would have thought?\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea muttered as if he was making an excuse.", "\u201cShe was so fast that I thought she was a wild lynx.\u201d", "\u201cWell, it was right not to let your guard down. Some Beastmen are strong from a young age.\u201d", "Hugo tapped Marcel Ghionea\u2019s shoulder while chewing on a piece of beef jerky.", "\u201cIs this your first time seeing a Beastman?\u201d", "Phi Sora nudged Seol Jihu\u2019s side and asked. Seol Jihu nodded his head blankly.", "\u201cStop staring so much. Can\u2019t you see you\u2019re scaring her?\u201d", "Phi Sora was right. Even though Teresa was doing her best to console the child, the situation was still the same. No one knew why the child was panicking so much, but she was rejecting humans to the point of getting spasms.", "The only solace in the situation was that she had finally stopped crying.", "Seol Jihu took his eyes off the child and asked.", "\u201cWhat race of Beastmen is that child?\u201d", "\u201cUh\u2026 not sure. We can\u2019t really tell from her ears. But from her tails\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora scratched her neck hard.", "\u201cShe\u2019s from the fox race.\u201d", "The one who answered was someone Seol Jihu didn\u2019t expect\u2014 Maria. She licked her lips endlessly and stole furtive glances at the Beastman child.", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cFox race?\u201d", "\u201cEarthlings call them the Foxmen. As they look like foxes, their official name is Vulpes. Because of their unique nine tails, they\u2019re also called Nine Tail.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened once he heard her detailed explanation.", "\u201cYou surprisingly know a lot about them.\u201d", "\u201cOf course!\u201d", "Maria raised her voice before making a circle with her thumb and index finger. Then, she shouted with an innocent face.", "\u201cBeastmen are lucrative!\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 lucrative?\u201d", "Maria nodded strongly.", "\u201cYes! Especially a Foxman, who are especially few in numbers. A child Foxman? They would practically be a blank check, mufufufu.\u201d", "Maria laughed insidiously before glancing at Seol Jihu. She seemed to be asking, \u2018So? You interested?\u2019", "A wry look crossed Seol Jihu\u2019s face. She was clearly suggesting that they sell this child Beastman off.", "\u2018Then\u2026 we\u2019d be treating her as a slave.\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s brain could neither accept nor allow it. In the first place, he had a tacit alliance with the Federation. He didn\u2019t need to confirm with anyone to know what they would think if they found out. In fact, the incident might even blow up to a full-blown show of force.", "\u201cI really hope it\u2019s not a big deal\u2026.\u201d", "Kazuki muttered quietly, exacerbating the uneasiness Seol Jihu was feeling. Seol Jihu asked, just to be sure.", "\u201cMister Kazuki, I may be worrying unnecessarily, but\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Kazuki replied without taking his eyes off the child.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if there are people kidnapping Beastmen and selling them as slaves, the answer is a definitive yes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu had guessed as much. Rather than saying \u2018No way\u2019, he simply shut his mouth.", "Humans were willing to attack each other for the sake of personal benefits. Who was to say they wouldn\u2019t touch the Federation?", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Beastmen. Dwarves, Cave Fairies, Sky Fairies, and even Fallen Angels. I wouldn\u2019t say slave hunting is prevalent, but there is most certainly a black market for it. Naturally, poachers provide the products.\u201d", "\u201cThose goddamn bastards\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu clenched his teeth. Humans should be begging to cooperate with the Federation, so what bullshit was this?", "\u201cDo the Royal Families know? If they do\u2014\u201d", "\u201cSome Royal Families have legislation banning the act, and they severely punish anyone who\u2019s caught. Haramark is a good example.\u201d", "Seol Jihu turned to Teresa reflexively. Her efforts seemed to have paid off as the Beastman child was calmly resting in her embrace. She had her head dropped with a glum look, though.", "\u201cBut the Eva Royal Family, which is closest to the Federation, has a slightly different stance. They\u2019re\u2026 a bit vague about it.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019ve put out a royal decree banning the act\u2026 but that\u2019s it. They simply ignore the issue, as if it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re ignoring the issue?\u201d", "\u201cI personally think there are two reasons.\u201d", "Kazuki calmly explained his reasoning.", "\u201cThe Eva Royal Family has very little regal power. The public sees Eva as an ideal kingdom where Earthlings and the Royal Family have a cooperative relationship, but it\u2019s more correct to say that Earthlings have a tight control over authority. Moreover, because their ruler is young, it\u2019s said that an Earthling rules in their place.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s ears perked up once information about Eva came out. As he planned to move there soon, he couldn\u2019t help but be curious.", "\u201cAlso, the Eva Royal Family doesn\u2019t see the Federation in a good light.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since the Federation and humanity formed their tacit alliance. Although I\u2019ve never seen it personally, people say their relationship used to be just as antagonistic and hostile as with the Parasites. We know for a fact that they\u2019ve gone to war before\u2026 and the Eva Royal Family was at the head of that war.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cMost importantly, the current ruler of Eva, Queen Adora, lost her father and mother, the previous King and Queen, in the war against the Parasites, and lost her one and only older brother in the war against the Federation.\u201d", "Kazuki sighed.", "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand where she\u2019s coming from, but for a ruler of a nation to ignore such a pressing issue\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOh please, give me a break.\u201d", "At that moment, Phi Sora, who was quietly listening to the conversation, cut in.", "\u201cYou\u2019re framing the issue like it\u2019s the humans\u2019 fault. But we have something to say about that too.\u201d", "What did she mean by this?", "\u201cYou know that the Beastmen Alliance doesn\u2019t see us favorably, right?\u201d", "\u201cI do.\u201d", "\u201cThen how can you say what you just said? What do you think is the reason that the slave hunt became a thing in the first place? It\u2019s because Earthlings kept disappearing in the border region! That\u2019s what set us off and made us fight back.\u201d", "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been revealed which side started first.\u201d", "\u201cFine, we\u2019ll leave it at that. But you can\u2019t deny that people went missing.\u201d", "This was the first time Seol Jihu was hearing any of this. It had to be an issue from long before Seol Jihu ever entered Paradise.", "\u201cIs that true?\u201d", "Seol Jihu cut in.", "Phi Sora crossed her arms and nodded her head in affirmation.", "\u201cYes! I know it\u2019s true! For the record, I\u2019ve participated in a reconnaissance of Eva\u2019s border region when I was in White Rose.\u201d", "\u201cWhat was the result?\u201d", "\u201cThere were countless trails going in, but very few trails coming out. This was in the border region of the Federation and humanity, since Tigol Fortress was blocking the Parasites. How are we supposed to interpret this?\u201d", "Seol Jihu stole a glance at Kazuki, who was maintaining his silence.", "Phi Sora cleared her throat.", "\u201cDear, I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m correct. I\u2019m just telling you not to think so one-sidedly.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThink about it. If humans were 100 percent at fault, do you think the Federation would stop at just strengthening their security? No, they would have pulled out their swords and barged in. Their lukewarm reaction means that they have a guilty conscience.\u201d", "She had a point.", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201cBut that Beastman is just a child\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora replied firmly.", "\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate her. Even adolescent Beastmen have a terrifying battle prowess. Strong reproductive ability and being powerful from a young age are Beastmen\u2019s traits!\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not always the case.\u201d", "The moment Phi Sora emphasized that they shouldn\u2019t be compared to human children, Kazuki rebutted.", "\u201cI agree that their growth speeds rival the Orcs, but their reproductive ability depends on what subrace they belong to. The Foxmen are well-known for having a low fertility rate and thus cherishing each of their members. If we kill her or take her back with us, there\u2019s a huge chance it will become a diplomatic problem.\u201d", "\u201cWho said we should kill her? I was just\u2014\u201d", "Kazuki and Phi Sora bickered on and on.", "\u2018Interesting.\u2019", "The opinions on this issue were more varied than he thought, clear evidence that the relationship between the two nations was complicated.", "Seol Jihu glanced at Teresa again.", "\u2018What should I do?\u2019", "He remembered what Jang Maldong said.", "That there was a chance they might run into the Federation since they were going to the border region. That it was important to deal with the situation appropriately.", "\u2018He said it was an excellent decision to bring Princess Teresa along.\u2019", "After thinking about the matter in-depth, Seol Jihu walked forward slowly so that the Beastman child would not be startled.", "When he got near, the child flinched and trembled. Teresa looked up at Seol Jihu with a slightly exhausted and troubled expression.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I revealed my identity, but she\u2019s still worried\u2026 It looks like something horrible happened to her.\u201d", "Looking fixedly, Seol Jihu slowly squatted down and got on the same eye level as the child. The Foxman child, whose limbs had gone limp, slowly raised her head.", "\u2018Wow, look at her nose.\u2019", "It wasn\u2019t sharp like a human\u2019s. Seol Jihu had a strong urge to lick the child\u2019s black, fox-like nose. Looking at her glistening eyes, a gentle smile spread across his face.", "Then, he started a conversation.", "\u201cBoo!\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u2026It couldn\u2019t be helped.", "Although his teammates had warned him about her potentially being a threat, Seol Jihu loved children by nature. This was because he liked their reaction when he made fun of them or pranked them.", "\u201cLook at this.\u201d", "What Seol Jihu took out after talking amicably was\u2014 gum. He had brought it from Earth to chew on when he was bored.", "\u2018I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d use it like this though.\u2019", "After peeling it, he waved it in front of the child\u2019s face, then plopped it into his own mouth.", "Nom, nom.", "\u201cPuu\u2014\u201d", "He blew air into the gum and made a bubble. As expected of bubblegum, a bubble the size of his head quickly formed.", "\u201cOh, my? What\u2019s that?\u201d", "Realizing Seol Jihu\u2019s intentions, Teresa quickly chimed in.", "\u201cTada~\u201d", "When Seol Jihu brought the bubble close\u2026", "\u201cUuun, uuuun!\u201d", "The Foxman child frowned and waved her hands at a loss for words. When her nails brushed the surface of the bubble, it popped with a boom and went splat on Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "Not knowing that it would burst so easily, the Foxman\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cAck!\u201d", "Seol Jihu fumbled with his face exaggeratingly. He then took off the gum and giggled.", "When Teresa covered her mouth and also giggled, the corner of the dazed Foxman child\u2019s mouth twitched ever so slightly.", "\u201cHow could you~? I blew a bubble for you. Wuuuu, it\u2019s so sticky\u2026\u201d", "Perhaps finding Seol Jihu pulling the gum off his face funny\u2026", "\u201cHeehee.\u201d", "Though faint, the child broke out into laughter for the first time.", "\u201cWhat do you think? It\u2019s pretty cool, right?\u201d", "The Foxman child nodded cautiously.", "Seol Jihu smiled timidly and handed her a gum.", "\u201cYou wanna try too?\u201d", "The Foxman child blinked. Curiosity clearly glimmered on her face.", "Teresa, who was watching quietly, was startled on the inside. The child\u2019s stiff ears and tail slowly relaxed. Next, her ears folded halfway and her tail began to wag. The Foxman child\u2019s mentality was clearly changing.", "\u201cSniff, sniff.\u201d", "Perhaps still a little suspicious, she put her nose against the gum and smelled it for a long time.", "Teresa was a bit nervous, but Seol Jihu was calm. He didn\u2019t force the child in any way and waited patiently.", "Soon, the Foxman child grabbed the gum and bit down. She took a deep breath after sucking the juice out.", "Seeing her reaction, Seol Jihu asked with a bright smile.", "\u201cSweet and tasty, right?\u201d", "Nod, nod.", "\u201cDon\u2019t suck on it and chew. You\u2019ll get more of the sweetness that way.\u201d", "The Foxman child obediently began to nibble. She must have really liked the intense sweetness as her nibbling didn\u2019t stop for a while.", "\u201cWow\u2026\u201d", "Teresa subconsciously let out an exclamation of awe. She had such trouble calming the child down, but Seol Jihu had succeeded instantly. As she didn\u2019t know Seol Jihu\u2019s talent for taking care of children, she couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.", "\u201cChewing on gum helps you relax. Many athletes chew gum before going into games.\u201d", "Seol Jihu explained as he took the splattered gum off his face. The Foxman child stared at Seol Jihu fixedly before puffing her cheeks out like a balloon.", "\u201cHuuuu\u2026\u201d", "She blew hard, but only air came out. Seol Jihu burst into laughter.", "\u201cHaha! You have to put your tongue in the gum and blow air in between. Stu~pid!\u201d", "The Foxman child got angry.", "\u201cI\u2019m not stupid!\u201d", "\u201cOh?\u201d", "The child spoke for the first time. Seol Jihu shut his mouth and smiled mischievously.", "\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not stupid!\u201d", "\u201cOkay, if you\u2019re not Stupid, then what\u2019s your name?\u201d", "The Foxman child became flustered as if she didn\u2019t expect the conversation to go this way. Seol Jihu grinned and reached out with his hand.", "\u201cMy name is Seol\u2014\u201d", "He stopped himself short of saying \u2018Jihu.\u2019", "\u201cI\u2019m Seol.\u201d", "He had a feeling that the name \u2018Seol\u2019 might be known in the Federation. In the next moment, the Foxman child\u2019s eyes widened to a circle.", "\u201cSeol?\u201d", "\u201cYes, Seol.\u201d", "\u201cHuman\u2026 Seol?\u201d", "\u201cYep, that\u2019s me. What\u2019s your name?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked, but no reply came back. The child simply looked up at him absent-mindedly.", "\u2018Did I do something wrong?\u2019", "Just as Seol Jihu was scratching his cheek, the Foxman child asked again.", "\u201cThe Adversary? Are you really Seol the Adversary?\u201d", "Cough. Seol Jihu let out a light cough.", "The Adversary? Seol Jihu had been wondering where this cringey nickname came from.", "\u2018So it was the Federation?\u2019", "Anyways, the important thing was that this Foxman child knew who he was. Seol Jihu didn\u2019t let this opportunity go.", "\u201cOh, you know me?\u201d", "\u201cUn! The human who killed the First Army Commander!\u201d", "The Foxman child clenched her fists and shouted zealously.", "\u201cHehe, that\u2019s embarrassing. It was nothing big, really.\u201d", "\u201cWhaaaat? Nothing big? Really?\u201d", "\u201cOf course! First Army Commander? Sure, his title is cool, but that\u2019s it. I almost killed two more Army Commanders, but they ran away with their tails between their legs.\u201d", "\u201cUwoah\u2026!\u201d", "The Federation and humanity might not be on good terms, but could they hate each other more than they hate the Parasites?", "Hearing Seol Jihu\u2019s heroic tale, the Foxman child dropped her jaw in awe.", "\u201cBut I heard they\u2019re super strong\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWell, they are. It was hard even for me because those dirty bastards came at me simultaneously.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head.", "\u201cI ended up winning\u2026 but to be honest, it got a little dangerous. If it weren\u2019t for the Federation\u2019s help, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now.\u201d", "\u201cUn, un! I heard that the Sky Fairies gave you the Elixeer!\u201d", "The Foxman child clapped her hands together and shouted. Judging from her reaction, this story must be quite well-known in the Federation.", "\u201cYep. It was thanks to my good friends at the Federation that I miraculously survived.\u201d", "\u201cFriends? Human, friend?\u201d", "\u201cOf course! The Federation is my precious friend!\u201d", "Seol Jihu gave a thumbs up while winking.", "\u2018Stop smiling, Princess.\u2019", "To be honest, it was incredibly embarrassing. Although the Foxman child\u2019s sparkling pupils made Seol Jihu uncomfortable, he endured the embarrassment and decided to play along.", "\u201cI see, then\u2026\u201d", "A relaxed look spread across the Foxman child\u2019s face as she let out a sigh of relief.", "\u201cSince you\u2019re our friend, you\u2019ll send me back?\u201d", "\u201cOf course! My friend, Mikael, is there. We\u2019ll send you home safe and sound, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d", "\u201cWow, Mikael-nim\u2026?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu mentioned the name he dug up from the corner of his mind, the Foxman child looked assured, and a bright smile bloomed on his face.", "Next, Seol Jihu turned to Teresa, who was busy suppressing her laughter with her head dropped.", "Over to you Princess.", "Teresa barely managed to stop her laughter and slickly cut in.", "\u201cHey, can you tell us how you got here?
