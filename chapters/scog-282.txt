{"cid": "282", "title": "Chapter 282. After the Setup (3)", "content": ["Seol Jihu had no choice but to doubt his eyes when he saw a woman staggering out of the room with her hand against the wall.", "She was struggling to walk not because she was ill or morbidly obese. It was because she simply had too many layers of clothes on. No, this volume couldn\u2019t be because of having just too many clothes on.", "Seol Jihu stared at the outer padding that was about to burst, and lo and behold\u2026", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "The woman fumbled. She immediately spread out her arms in an attempt to balance herself, and Seol Jihu quickly rushed to support her.", "\u201cAre you okay?\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes.\u201d", "As the woman spoke while nodding her head\u2026", "\u201cI\u2019m fi\u2014\u201d", "Tk! The catcher\u2019s mask she was wearing fell to the ground.", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "The woman shut her mouth, not finishing her previous thought. Of course, Seol Jihu was at a loss for words as well.", "\u2018What the heck is this catcher\u2019s mask for? Why is she wearing it?\u2019", "She even had a hat on!", "At this moment, his cell phone rang once more along with Phi Sora\u2019s voice urging them to hurry.", "\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu pressed his forehead. He already had a lot on his mind. Many questions were yet to be answered, but he decided to ask what he was most curious about first.", "\u201cWhy\u2026 are you wearing all that?\u201d", "\u201cTo prepare for the Tutorial.\u201d", "Her voice was soft but clear. Rather than timid, she sounded empty and dry.", "\u201cTo prepare for the Tutorial?\u201d", "Scanning her outfit again, Seol Jihu\u2019s expression contorted.", "It was a strange sight no matter how many times he saw it. At least her bottoms were airier than the layers upon layers of clothes that she had on above her waist.", "\u201cDid you dress like that on purpose? To increase your defense?\u201d", "The woman didn\u2019t answer, seemingly sensing a negative connotation from his tone. She only looked up at him blankly.", "Seol Jihu corrected himself.", "\u201c\u2026Well, uh, you have great preparedness.\u201d", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "She bowed politely, then spoke.", "\u201cI put some thought in wearing this, but I think it would be better to take them off.\u201d", "\u201cRight? You think so?\u201d", "Thankfully, she didn\u2019t seem to be a complete idiot.", "As Seol Jihu was inwardly breathing a sigh of relief, the woman continued talking.", "\u201cI thought I was more than prepared with this until a moment ago. I realized how stupid I was when I opened my eyes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu did not miss the underlying meaning of her words. Her memories must have come back. In that case, this person really must be\u2026.", "The sound of struggling was heard. She was trying to take off her clothes, but could not even bring her arms together. After trying it a few times, she gave up and stared at Seol Jihu.", "Seol Jihu sighed.", "\u201c\u2026Let me help.\u201d", "Starting from the outermost padding, he got through six layers of tops and bottoms before taking out knee and shin protectors and finally the leather gaiters. Only then did her real clothes \u2014 a monotone tracksuit that was definitely penetrated by the wind \u2014 reveal itself.", "Coincidentally, Seol Jihu was also wearing a matching set of sweatshirt and sweatpants that Kim Hannah bought him, making the two look similar.", "\u201cWhew.\u201d", "Seemingly exhausted, the woman plunked down on the ground and spat out a sigh. It must have been scorching hot under all those layers as tiny beads of sweat were staining her light-grey tracksuit.", "Seol Jihu carefully studied her as she took off her hat and fanned her face with a look that said, \u2018Ah, I finally feel alive.\u2019", "Neat eyes that seemed to be drawn with a paintbrush and similarly graceful facial features that were like timidly bloomed peach blossoms.", "The atmosphere she gave off wasn\u2019t a joke either. She was simply sitting still, yet she gave off a cynical and sensitive air.", "Although she was in the same room as Seol Jihu, it felt like she was in a world of her own. Moreover, the beauty mark under one of her transient pupils gave off a heartrending allure.", "It was at this point that Seol Jihu realized Kim Hannah\u2019s previous description of her had been spot on. She was undeniably a beauty, but she also seemed to be a bit of an oddball. That said, he didn\u2019t yet understand what part of her was cheeky.", "Did she feel his gaze? The woman put her cap on again before getting up.", "\u201cThank you for helping me out.\u201d", "She cupped her hands together and bowed. Seol Jihu said what he should have said a long time ago.", "\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Seol Jihu.\u201d", "\u201cUm, you\u2019re the one who invited me, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes, and you must be\u2026\u201d", "\u201cEun Yuri.\u201d", "Eun Yuri spoke in a soft voice. Then\u2026", "\u2018Again.\u2019", "Her expression became dazed. She looked into the empty air, and her already blank expression disappeared completely.", "\u201cMiss Eun Yuri?\u201d", "Her ears must still be open as she snapped out instantly.", "\u201cAre you alright?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "A calm reply came out.", "\u201cI was just\u2026 organizing my thoughts a bit.\u201d", "Eun Yuri muttered as she wiped her forehead drenched with sweat.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t blame her for being confused. After all, she must have just gotten back the memories she lost.", "\u2018What does resurrecting feel like?\u2019 Seol Jihu grew curious about Eun Yuri\u2019s thoughts.", "\u201cDo you need my help with anything? Or do you have any questions?\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m pretty much set, thanks to Miss Kim Hannah explaining everything clearly\u2026 ah, but\u2026\u201d", "Eun Yuri shook her head in the middle of talking.", "\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to confirm.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded, signaling at her to go ahead.", "\u201cDid I really come back? To Paradise, I mean.\u201d", "It was a somewhat unexpected question. However, her low voice was filled with previously unexisting desperation.", "For some reason, this seemed to be an extremely important question to Eun Yuri.", "\u201cOf course. It\u2019ll sink in soon.\u201d", "Eun Yuri\u2019s complexion brightened slightly. She looked strangely relieved as if knowing this was enough for now.", "It was then. Wing, wing! Seol Jihu\u2019s cellphone vibrated again.", "\u2014Can you hurry up? What\u2019s up with these messages? Are you listening to me, dear? Argh, hurry up!", "Phi Sora\u2019s yelling flowed out.", "The sudden change must have caught her off guard even as the Tutorial\u2019s manager as her tone couldn\u2019t get more urgent.", "Seol Jihu finally took his eyes off of Eun Yuri and turned to the room she came from.", "\u201cThere are some things we need to talk about, but\u2026 should we first head to the gathering point?\u201d", "\u201cLooks like we should.\u201d", "Eun Yuri agreed immediately. Perhaps because she had gone through this before, she was quick to understand.", "\u201cGreat, hold on.\u201d", "Seol Jihu moved right away.", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "Eun Yuri seemed a little surprised, but Seol Jihu didn\u2019t pay it any mind and walked into the room to retrieve a cell phone.", "\u201cHere it is.\u201d", "Looking back, he saw a fidgeting Eun Yuri.", "\u201cUm, that\u2019s my room\u2026\u201d", "\u201cOh, sorry. I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry.\u201d", "\u201cN-No, it\u2019s not that\u2026\u201d", "Eun Yuri bit her lower lip and avoided his gaze. It didn\u2019t take long for Seol Jihu to find out why.", "\u2018This room\u2026\u2019", "To put it bluntly, it was a mess. There were at least six empty bags of chips and several ice cream sticks scattered everywhere.", "She must enjoy eating snacks as the room was full of traces of food. However, what caught Seol Jihu\u2019s attention the most was a notebook sitting on her desk.", "\u2018What to do before and after entering.\u2019", "Eun Yuri must have made her own plans after listening to Kim Hannah\u2019s explanation. Seol Jihu could clearly picture her jotting down ideas while snacking on ice cream and chips.", "\u2018Was she that excited?\u2019", "He felt this at the time of questioning her, but Eun Yuri really seemed to want to enter Paradise even though she shouldn\u2019t have had any memories of it.", "The more Seol Jihu thought about this, the more curious he got. However, he decided to ask about it later and left the room to hand her the cell phone.", "Eun Yuri quickly received it. Her gaze then fell on the empty air.", "[Identity confirmed. You have been registered as a user.][Sender: The Guide]", "She immediately checked her phone.", "[1. Gather at the island lot by the designated time][2. Remaining Time 00:03:17]", "\u2018Island lot? Not the school auditorium?\u2019", "The start of the Tutorial was clearly different from what Seol Jihu remembered.", "Eun Yuri, who was staring at her phone, also looked back at Seol Jihu. She seemed to be asking for an explanation as the Tutorial wasn\u2019t what she remembered.", "\u201cDid you hear the first message?\u201d", "\u201cYes, the bonus privilege of the gold mark\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on either. This is also a first for me or anyone else in Paradise for that matter.\u201d", "Eun Yuri\u2019s eyes widened slightly.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. The Guide should know something about it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d", "Eun Yuri nodded silently, then opened the door.", "It was dark outside. Dark clouds blanketed the sky, not revealing a single star. Seol Jihu confirmed another change as soon as he stepped out. His fear had come to life as he wasn\u2019t in a city, but a jungle.", "A dense forest filled up his vision. The place he and Eun Yuri came out of wasn\u2019t Eun Yuri\u2019s apartment room, but a jungle cabin.", "\u2018Let me get this straight.\u2019", "The Gold Mark wasn\u2019t the direct cause of the Tutorial\u2019s change. It was because a Helper had entered with the Gold Mark Invited. The problem was that no one knew this until now.", "\u2018Sung Shihyun must have also entered the Tutorial alone.\u2019", "Otherwise, someone should have known about it, and there was no way Kim Hannah wouldn\u2019t have heard about such a rare occurrence.", "In other words, Eun Yuri must be the first person in the history of Paradise to have entered Paradise with a Helper, thereby triggering a type of hidden piece.", "Of course, the fact that Eun Yuri resurrected might have played a role in it as well.", "\u2018Hopefully, Miss Phi Sora knows something\u2026\u2019", "Just as he set out after organizing his thoughts, Seol Jihu almost stopped.", "\u2018\u2026A hum?\u2019", "Because of a faint hum. Although it was barely audible, it was most certainly a nasal hum.", "Looking back sneakily, he saw Eun Yuri following behind him. She nodded as she looked left and right, and a faint smile was hanging on her face.", "Suddenly, the humming stopped.", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "Their eyes met. Realizing that Seol Jihu was staring, the smile on her face disappeared completely. Eun Yuri pushed her snapback hat down as she lowered her head.", "\u2018This person\u2026\u2019", "The more he looked at her, the stranger she seemed. He could attribute a portion of her calmness to her recovering her lost memories, but shouldn\u2019t she be anxious about the Tutorial changing?", "She looked like she was having a blast, like a kid who was secretly happy after getting a surprise present.", "Seol Jihu wanted to ask what she was so happy about, but he could only swallow his words as he began to hear faint murmurings of people.", "Turning back to the front, he saw an orange lampost emitting a cross-shaped light in the far distance.", "It was the island lot.", "*", "Marcel Ghionea was standing on the path to the lot. He was nicely dressed in a black suit.", "He looked like he had questions to ask, but he paused when Seol Jihu gestured at him with his eyes. In the next moment, he spoke courteously.", "\u201cGood job coming all the way here. You can go left.\u201d", "\u201cThanks. You look great by the way.\u201d", "Seol Jihu whispered as he passed Marcel Ghionea.", "\u201cHuhu, thank you, Representative.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea also returned a quiet reply, but seeing as how Eun Yuri gave the two men a back-and-forth look, she must have heard the conversation between them.", "A bonfire was burning in the middle of the spacious lot. People inside the lot were separated into two groups using a line drawn in the middle. Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t hide his surprise when he first saw it.", "\u2018Wow.\u2019", "There wasn\u2019t a single person on the left. That meant there were no other Invited present.", "\u2018Now this is a first.\u2019", "\u201cThanks for coming early.\u201d", "At that moment, a woman who was sitting on a chair next to the bonfire stood up.", "\u201cOh~\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened. It was Phi Sora wearing a silver suit, office skirt, and opaque stockings. Looking at her like this gave Seol Jihu a whole other feeling.", "\u201cOh, my ass.\u201d", "Phi Sora gritted her teeth. For some reason, an oval ocean-colored portal was situated next to her. Did it have something to do with the Tutorial\u2019s change?", "\u201c\u2026Alright, now that all 75, or rather 76 people, are here.\u201d", "Phi Sora sighed before scratching her head hard. She looked taken aback by the sudden change.", "Now that he thought about it, the 74 Contracted were all dead silent. It wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to be discussing loudly after being summoned to such a strange place, but most of them were simply looking at Phi Sora in fear.", "\u2018Well, it\u2019s pretty obvious what happened.\u2019", "He didn\u2019t even need to look to know that Phi Sora must have lashed out and crushed their spirits. Judging by the huge cracks on the ground, she must have blown up grandly.", "\u201cArgh\u2026 how am I supposed to explain this\u2026 really\u2026 I already have a thousand things to do\u2026\u201d", "Her mind must be in chaos. How could it not, when the person who should be waiting in the Neutral Zone suddenly appeared in the Tutorial, which also changed drastically?", "Phi Sora clicked her tongue after glaring at Seol Jihu resentfully.", "\u201cFirst\u2026 it looks like an explanation of the current situation is needed. You must be curious. Why we\u2019re on this shitty island instead of a school.\u201d", "A few of the Contracted nodded their heads. They must have gotten an explanation on Earth.", "\u201cFirst, I\u2019ll read the message I got word by word.\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s eyes turned to the air. It seemed a separate message went to the Guide just like Seol Jihu predicted.", "\u201cIf the Neutral Zone is a place of learning and developing, then the Tutorial is a place to screen your qualification to learn.\u201d", "She spoke monotonously like she was reading a textbook.", "\u201cBut when a \u2018special\u2019 Invited is brought in with a \u2018special\u2019 method, the Tutorial can only lose its original intent. The first reason is that this implies that the Invited has already proven their qualification. The second reason is the existence of the Helper.\u201d", "Phi Sora cleared her throat.", "\u201cAnd thus, after much deliberation over many complex elements, the Seven Gods agreed on a special arrangement for the specially summoned Invited for this one-of-a-kind situation. However, this arrangement shall not be forced upon the Invited. They will have a choice.\u201d", "After ending there, Phi Sora looked down.", "\u201cYou all can make a choice. Whether to stay here and start the Special Tutorial, or\u2014\u201d", "She pointed to the blue portal before continuing.", "\u201cTo go back to where you\u2019re supposed to be and start the Basic Tutorial. For the record, this applies to both Contracted and Invited, and this will be your choice to make.\u201d", "\u201cMiss Guide! I have a question.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shouted as he shot his hand up. Phi Sora replied curtly.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying, but\u2026 what is the exact difference between the two?\u201d", "\u201cThe difficulty.\u201d", "Phi Sora said clearly.", "\u201cThe Special Tutorial is incomparably more difficult than the Basic Tutorial. Supposedly, this special Tutorial has the same difficulty as the Neutral Zone\u2019s Very Hard mission.\u201d", "Seol Jihu instantly lost all his excitement.", "\u2018Very Hard\u2026. That\u2019s it?\u2019", "For Seol Jihu\u2019s current strength, a Very Hard difficulty mission wouldn\u2019t even wake him up a day after he drank himself to sleep.", "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d", "However, Phi Sora foretold a twist next.", "\u201cIt says the difficulty may increase depending on the situation. And although there is only a low chance, certain conditions being met may make the difficulty increase to Impossible.\u201d", "Seol Jihu paused hearing the word \u2018impossible\u2019. Now this changed the story.", "\u201c\u2026Is the difficulty the only thing that goes up?\u201d", "\u201cOf course not.\u201d", "Phi Sora shook her head.", "\u201cThe reward will naturally be proportional to the difficulty. For the record, there is a world of difference between the rewards depending on the conditions met. It says they\u2019re gods\u2019 gifts that can be used not just in the Tutorial, but also the Neutral Zone and even Paradise.\u201d", "\u2018They said there was a hidden space.\u2019", "Seol Jihu fell into thought. In truth, he was already leaning heavily to one side. By definition, an arrangement referred to plans or preparations for a future event. In that case\u2026", "\u2018Rather than trying to screw us over\u2026\u2019", "It was likely a way for them to give everything to them. It was easy to see from the way they were given a choice.", "\u2018This is a definite must.\u2019", "No matter how difficult the Tutorial was, could it be harder than fighting the Parasites\u2019 Seven Armies?", "Having made up his mind, Seol Jihu turned around. Eun Yuri also nodded without any complaints. There was no reason for her to refuse. Because after hearing Kim Hannah\u2019s explanation and also recovering her memories, she fully understood how incredible the man in front of her was.", "\u201cSo? Are you guys doing the Special Tutorial?\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Alright, first, take this.\u201d", "Phi Sora threw a piece of paper over. The paper spun in the air before turning into a golden bag and a leather bag and falling in front of Eun Yuri.", "\u201cThere is a separate bag for the Invited. Apparently, it was prepared in case any of the Contracted wanted to challenge the Special Tutorial. Of course, that includes the Invited.\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s voice rang out.", "\u201cI thought it normally wasn\u2019t given out.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s in the Basic Tutorial, but here it\u2019s different. It\u2019s probably because you\u2019ll all die as soon as the Tutorial starts without it.\u201d", "Eun Yuri opened the golden bag.", "\u2014Necessary Box x4\u2014Mark of Survival x1\u2014Diary of an Unknown Survivor x1", "The vacant eyes lit up for the first time.", "\u201cWow\u2026\u201d", "She hugged the golden bag tightly.", "\u201c\u2026I think I just got something amazing.\u201d", "Seeing her whisper quietly, Seol Jihu grinned.", "\u201cThey\u2019re the bonus items given to a Gold Mark, after all.\u201d", "Phi Sora smacked her lips while looking at the duo.", "\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s it for the Invited. I\u2019ll text you the rest of the details so read it later. Supposedly, getting just one good reward here will let you live like royalty in the Neutral Zone.\u201d", "With that, Phi Sora turned to the group on the right side.", "\u201cNow, let\u2019s see. The rest of you can follow me. I\u2019ll explain everything again once we get to the school auditorium. You see this portal, right?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI guarantee not a single one of you can pass this stage. Because this stage wasn\u2019t made for you all to attempt it.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWell, if you have a death wish, I won\u2019t stop you. But you\u2019d best follow me if you don\u2019t want to die.\u201d", "Phi Sora turned around. Although she tried to enter the portal first, her feet stopped.", "\u201cWhat are you doing? Hurry up.\u201d", "The lot was still dead silent.", "\u201cHello? Are you listening?\u201d", "Not a single one of the Contracted moved. A few flinched but that was it. They were all standing still like they were pinned to the ground.", "\u201c\u2026Oh?\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s eyebrow went up."]}
