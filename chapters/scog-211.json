{"cid": "211", "title": "Chapter 211. An Unexpected Gain (2)", "content": ["The carriages passed the border and entered the entrance of the border region. The expedition team got off the carriages and began to march toward the destination.", "Not a single monster attacked them during their march. In fact, they didn\u2019t see even a single one of them.", "This was because the nearby area was frequented by humans and the members of the Federation. Unlike the Forest of Denial, which bordered the Parasites\u2019 territory, hundreds or even thousands of monster subjugations had already taken place here.", "As a result, the expedition team was able to walk without disturbance until the sun set.", "\u201cJesus, it\u2019s almost night. Can those bastards be any slower? What if they\u2019re trying to screw us over by scaring us and preventing us from falling asleep?\u201d", "Chohong spat out one complaint after the other, even suggesting that the Federation was going to ambush them after sucking them dry of their stamina.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say anything because he knew she was simply grumbling from the boring march.", "\u2018Why aren\u2019t they here yet\u2026?\u2019", "In truth, Seol Jihu was rather worried. The words \u2018never sleep\u2019 kept weighing on his mind.", "They were still far from their destination. At this rate, they would have no choice but to march through the night.", "At that moment, Kazuki, who was leading the group, suddenly stopped.", "\u201cMister Kazuki?\u201d", "Silence.", "Seol Jihu quickly walked up. Kazuki was glaring with his mouth shut and his eyes straight ahead. It was as if he was saying, \u2018Would you look at this?\u2019", "And soon, Kazuki spoke quietly.", "\u201c\u2026Sorry.\u201d", "Everyone expressed concerns at his sudden apology.", "\u201cI was trying to be mindful\u2026\u201d", "A single bead of cold sweat fell from Kazuki\u2019s cheek.", "\u201cBut it seems we\u2019re surrounded.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took a good look around him. Left, right, forward, and backward. He could only see dense trees and thick grass.", "A bleak wind blew.", "\u201cHoh!\u201d", "A short exclamation of awe carried by the wind flowed into their ears.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened slightly. He couldn\u2019t see anyone, yet he could hear such a clear voice?", "\u201cYou have excellent senses, human.\u201d", "Chohong immediately raised her Thorn of Steel and got into her battle stance. Teresa pulled Chohong back, then shouted.", "\u201cWeren\u2019t you contacted by the upper echelon? We are\u2014!\u201d", "\u201cWe know.\u201d", "The voice gave a calm affirmation. Seol Jihu focused on the voice.", "\u201cBut there\u2019s a slight problem that prevents us from revealing ourselves to you.\u201d", "The slightly husky voice wasn\u2019t clear, but it wasn\u2019t unpleasant because it was deep. In fact, it gave off the scent of a powerful warrior.", "\u201cCan you stand still without asking any questions or making any demands? Of course, we mean you should do as we say.\u201d", "\u201cWhat bullshit is this?\u201d", "\u201cNo way.\u201d", "Chohong threw Teresa off angrily and raised her mace threateningly. Marcel Ghionea also tightened his grip on his crossbow. The two of them each had their own view of the Federation, but they couldn\u2019t just stand still, being told this after getting surrounded.", "\u201cIf you don\u2019t agree, we will have to ask you to leave. We will neither attack nor chase after you.\u201d", "When the voice spoke as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal, Maria clenched her fists.", "\u201cWho are you to tell us what to do!? We\u2019re going somewhere!\u201d", "\u201cThen you may continue. But\u2026 you will regret it.\u201d", "The voice spoke mockingly and nonchalantly.", "\u201cDo as you want. But to give you advice for rescuing our comrades, we suggest you go back to Eva immediately. Go to Invidia\u2019s temple without running into humans, if possible.\u201d", "This really came out of the blue. But rather than repeating the things the voice said like a parrot, Seol Jihu remembered the condition the Federation had said earlier.", "\u201cWe aren\u2019t allowed to sleep on our way back either?\u201d", "\u201cSmart.\u201d", "Fufufufu. Subdued laughter rang out.", "Seol Jihu pondered. It would have been better if the voice gave a clear explanation, but as the situation stood now, he was at a crossroad. If this were a game, the screen would show something like this.", "[Listen to the Federation and stand still obediently.][Leave the Foxmen children and continue the expedition.][Leave the Foxmen children and return to Eva.]", "\u2018I don\u2019t feel any malice or hostility\u2026 in fact, it feels like he\u2019s trying to help us.\u2019", "Left with these choices, Seol Jihu activated his Nine Eyes. As soon as he checked the color, he exclaimed in shock.", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "Red. Immediate Retreat Recommended.", "The important thing was that the red color only existed around Seol Jihu and the members of the expedition. The place where the Federation was presumed to be was yellow, and the rest of the region was green.", "He had committed a grave blunder.", "Since when was the expedition team dyed in red?", "\u2018Could it be?\u2019", "Seol Jihu looked down at Haeya, who was in his arms, then immediately made up his mind.", "\u201cChohong, lower your weapon.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? Oi, Seol\u2014\u201d", "\u201cChung Chohong.\u201d", "When Chohong tried to object, Kazuki failed to hold himself back and growled.", "\u201cLoosen your shoulders a bit.\u201d", "Chohong furrowed her brows, hearing his cold biting remark.", "\u201cWhat? What did you just say?\u201d", "\u201cYou were capable of separating your public and private life when you were Level 4, so what\u2019s this? Now that you\u2019re a High Ranker, are you suddenly too proud to listen to your leader?\u201d", "Chohong shrunk back, sensing the icy needles that were shooting out of Kazuki\u2019s glaring eyes. That was how enraged Kazuki was.", "\u201cNot only is this the leader\u2019s decision, but I, the header, am also staying silent. What qualification do you have to keep acting as you please in this expedition?\u201d", "Chohong did not know this, but Kazuki had been displeased ever since the group ran into Haeryeo. Even Seol Jihu, the leader of the expedition, asked for and respected his opinions, but Chohong had been ignoring his authority as the header.", "Chohong quickly turned purple with rage. But in the end, her mouth, which seemed ready to burst out with all sorts of curses, closed shut.", "During an expedition, all decisions were made through the leader and the header\u2019s combined consent. Chohong really didn\u2019t have anything to say once Kazuki brought up this basic rule.", "While she fumed, she obediently put her mace down. She then took in a deep breath and spat out.", "\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be more careful in the future.\u201d", "Though she was temperamental, cleanly admitting her faults was one of Chohong\u2019s good points.", "\u201cMay we presume that your staying means you will do as we say?\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied back.", "\u201cWe will accept your help.\u201d", "\u201cGood. Then we will send someone over. Stay still and do not move.\u201d", "Just like the voice said, someone appeared from the grass.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t make out the figure\u2019s face as a spotless white cloth was covering every inch of the figure. It almost seemed as if the figure was a shrine maiden wearing a ceremonial robe.", "The only other notable feature was that the figure held a smoked tree branch that seemed to have been struck by lightning.", "The figure walked forward, stopping a little way in front of the group.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Silence filled the air. Just as Seol Jihu realized that he was staring at the figure too fixedly, the tree branch suddenly pointed at him.", "\u201cHuman.\u201d", "Seol Jihu placed his hand on his chest as if to ask, \u2018Me?\u2019", "The figure in front of him slowly nodded.", "\u201cTry activating the power of your left bracelet, please.\u201d", "Unlike before, the voice was clear and silvery. Now that he got a closer look, the hand holding onto the tree branch was a white-apricot-color.", "\u2018A Sky Fairy?\u2019", "That was the first thought that popped up in his head, but Seol Jihu quickly set the thought aside and roused his mana.", "Woong! A tri-circular shield formed from his left wrist. Seol Jihu showed the shield off, spinning it side to side, but the figure did not budge.", "It was then.", "Pssssh!", "Seol Jihu doubted his eyes. Two of the three circular shields turned to dust and began to scatter away.", "The Blessing of the Circum protected its user from three types of attacks: physical, magical, and witchcraft. Of these three, the two shields protecting him from magic and witchcraft were quickly withering away.", "\u201cAs we thought, you\u2019ve been infected.\u201d", "The figure took a few steps forward before carefully reaching her hand out.", "Tak, tak. Starting from Seol Jihu, she hit everyone\u2019s foreheads with the tree branch.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s bewilderment only lasted a moment. Soon, his eyes widened for a whole other reason. And that was because he felt a refreshing energy spreading from his head down to his body.", "He didn\u2019t feel that there was anything wrong with his body before, but he now felt refreshed as if he just got out of the sauna.", "\u201cThe purification operation has been completed.\u201d", "The figure went around the expedition team before turning around and speaking in a terse manner. Seol Jihu noticed that parts of the white cloth covering the figure turned black, almost as if it was scorched by fire.", "\u201cGood. Next\u2026\u201d", "In the next moment, shadows shot up around them. About ten shadows formed a circle around the expedition team before slowly getting closer.", "There was one shadow that took the lead and walked forward with big strides. This figure was a tall woman with thin, sharp ears.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s attention was taken away by the woman, whose black hair reached all the way down to her butt.", "She was wearing a maroon-colored leather jacket and ivory-colored leather pants. Four daggers were hanging on one side of her hip, and a long sword wrapped in a leather cloth was hanging on the other side. The thing that stood out the most was that her otherwise white face had a black band covering her eyes.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know whether it was purely for outward appearance or if there was a reason behind it, but what he couldn\u2019t deny was that she gave off a mysterious aura because of it.", "Soon, her knee-high boots with black cleats stopped.", "Seol Jihu raised his eyes and turned to the woman standing still with a tree branch. Once he saw her again, he became certain.", "The person who appeared first was from a different race than the other ten.", "First, their skin color was different. Although they all had white skin tone, the woman holding the tree branch had a healthy tone on her skin.", "On the other hand, the ones covering their eyes were pale as if they grew up inside a cave, never having been exposed to sunlight. They were so white that Seol Jihu felt like he was seeing white limestone.", "Most importantly, their smell was different. If the woman wearing the ceremonial dress gave off a fruity scent, then the other ten gave off the smell of chlorine similar to that of a swimming pool.", "\u201cI see, so you\u2019re the war hero known as the Adversary.\u201d", "Seol Jihu groaned. The woman who seemed to be the group\u2019s leader was standing right in front of him. From the back, Seol Jihu could hear Teresa letting out a startled \u201cOh, my.\u201d", "\u201cLet me introduce myself.\u201d", "The woman reached out.", "\u201cMy name is Yuirel Antrum Valenheim.\u201d", "Seol Jihu grabbed her hand.", "\u201cI\u2019m Seol Jihu.\u201d", "\u201cSeol Jihu. Your surname is Seol and your name is Jihu?\u201d", "Yuirel gripped his hand lightly before letting go and walking over to Teresa who was staring with widened eyes.", "\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re meeting each other. You\u2019re prettier in person.\u201d", "\u201cYes, we\u2019ve only seen each other through communication crystals until now. Thank you for your compliment.\u201d", "Teresa also shook hands and laughed delightedly.", "\u201cThank you for the previous war. We recaptured Tigol Fortress with ease thanks to you.\u201d", "\u201cNot at all. With this, we\u2019ve repaid the debt for stopping the mutant Orc mass-production plan.\u201d", "\u201cAh, also\u2014 I heard. Though it\u2019s a little late, I\u2019m sorry for your loss of Breast Chuchu.\u201d", "Teresa breathed out a light sigh.", "\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows.", "\u2018Breast Chuchu?\u2019", "No matter how he thought about it, translating it literally, it meant \u2018kissing tits\u2019.", "Just as he thought, \u2018I don\u2019t know who it is, but that\u2019s a stupid name.\u2019", "[Like 'em Titties. He said that his surname was Titties and that his given name was Like 'em.]", "For some reason, Ian flashed by his brain.", "\u2018No way!\u2019", "\u201cWhat a shame. There aren\u2019t many people who understood the Federation like Haramark\u2019s Royal Magician.\u201d", "Hearing Yuirel\u2019s regretful comment, Seol Jihu closed his eyes. It seemed Ian really left his mark wherever he went.", "Clicking his tongue inwardly, Seol Jihu stared at Yuirel who was having a small conversation with Teresa. The aura she was giving off was no joke, and Seol Jihu had personally felt this when he grabbed her hand.", "He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she was far stronger than she seemed.", "\u201cAnyways, this is a surprise. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come personally\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI was around the border region for a business when I was contacted by the upper echelon. I set everything aside and came here since I was interested.\u201d", "Seol Jihu became convinced after what Teresa said. Noticing that Seol Jihu was curious, Kazuki whispered.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a Cave Fairy. I\u2019m glad.\u201d", "As he thought, she wasn\u2019t a Sky Fairy.", "\u201cYou\u2019re glad?\u201d", "\u201cCave Fairies are similar to humans, and they view us favorably as well.\u201d", "Kazuki continued.", "\u201cThis Yuirel woman must be the Fairy General.\u201d", "\u201cThe Fairy General?\u201d", "\u201cThe second-in-command of the Cave Fairies. Think of her as the commander-in-chief. I\u2019m positive. Valenheim is\u2014\u201d", "Kazuki closed his mouth, not finishing his sentence. This was because Yuirel turned around and faced Seol Jihu. Seeing Haeya in his embrace, she grinned.", "\u201cYou little rascals.\u201d", "\u201cIiiiing!\u201d", "Haeya groaned and dug deeper into Seol Jihu\u2019s embrace. Yuirel giggled.", "\u201cThank you again. These two children\u2019s mother is on her way. We said we would bring them back, but she insisted on coming.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m glad to bring them back safe and sound. Here\u2014\u201d", "Seol Jihu was about to hand Haeya over, but paused. Haeya was refusing to let go.", "\u201cW-What\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s time to go back.\u201d", "Seol Jihu forced her off and put her down, but Haeya waddled back and clung to his leg.", "\u201cHaeya?\u201d", "\u201cRawr!\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna go?\u201d", "\u201cRawr!\u201d", "\u2018\u2026The heck?\u2019", "He tried to console Haeya, but she refused to budge. Rather than liking him a lot, it seemed like she was afraid of the Cave Fairy. Most likely, Foxmen must hate or be unfriendly with the Cave Fairies.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know what to do. Seeing this, Yuirel opened her mouth.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Worst case, we can grab her by the tail or knock her unconscious.\u201d", "\u201cRawr, rawr!\u201d", "\u2026Seol Jihu was beginning to see why Haeya was afraid.", "\u201cHm,\u201d Yuirel stroked the cloth covering her eyes before speaking.", "\u201cSetting these two aside, I heard you were going somewhere. May I know why you came all the way here?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s to go to a place called the Pagoda of Infection.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t try to hide where they were going. He knew there was no point with a Sky Fairy in their midst.", "Yuirel asked.", "\u201cThe Pagoda of Infection\u2026 you mean, the Pagoda of Dreams?\u201d", "\u201cIs that what it\u2019s called in the Federation?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 I guess they\u2019re both correct names, in a sense.\u201d", "Yuirel nodded her head, murmuring to herself.", "Seol Jihu gulped. He was thinking that this might be the case, and now he was certain. However, this also meant that the Federation learned of the pagoda first.", "But he wasn\u2019t worried. According to Haeryeo, the Pagoda of Dreams was the Federation\u2019s forbidden ground. There was a good chance that the inheritance was still buried, not having been discovered.", "\u201cIs it absolutely necessary to go? If possible, I suggest you return.\u201d", "\u201cIs there a problem with going?\u201d", "\u201cProblem\u2026 Are you asking if the Federation is uncomfortable with you going? Well, I don\u2019t really mind.\u201d", "Yuirel rubbed the back of her head before sighing.", "\u201cBut I think it would be a shame if the hero those sparrows revived using their precious Elixeer died in vain.\u201d", "With that, Yuirel tilted her head up. She seemed to be savoring the evening glow, even though it shouldn\u2019t be visible.", "\u201cAre you going right away?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head. It was better to go in the morning than at night.", "\u201cThen you\u2019ll probably camp out for the night.\u201d", "A light flickered on in Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes. As he wasn\u2019t stupid, he easily understood that she was trying to tell him something. This was the perfect opportunity as he was worried about the lack of information about the place. Not to mention, the number of questions he had only kept growing as the expedition progressed.", "\u201cIf it\u2019s alright, can you tell us about the Pagoda of Infection in detail?\u201d", "\u201cOf course, that\u2019s easy. And to be honest\u2014\u201d", "Yuirel nodded her head as though she had been waiting for these words. Then, she turned her gaze down.", "Underneath her veiled eyes\u2026", "\u201cI wanted to talk to you at least once.\u201d", "Red lips that contrasted her peachy skin curled into a seductive smile."]}
