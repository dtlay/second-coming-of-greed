He didn\u2019t know what to expect or how many more he\u2019d run into in the next couple of days.", "That wasn\u2019t his only concern.", "Once, he tried to avoid the Parasites but failed. They pursued him as if their lives depended on it, and a new army appeared on the road he had chosen to avoid the earlier army.", "This could only mean that the Parasites were coming at him from all directions, and was proof that Unsightly Humility had been telling him the truth.", "For example, like now.", "Bzzzzz!", "He heard the buzzing of bees on the left.", "Hundreds of Bugs and Cockroaches appeared on the left road.", "\u2018A piece of cake.\u2019", "He thought, but when he turned his eyes to the right, he changed his mind.", "Hundreds of enemies had appeared on his right.

He planned to ask her to handle the Evil Phantoms while he took care of Hydras.", "But when he turned his head forward, Seol Jihu\u2019s mind became blank with shock.", "He saw the elite armies led by the Army Commanders appear in the distance.", "Two of the Six Armies were coming.", "Together with them, the Fifth and the Sixth Army Commanders appeared, as if everything wasn\u2019t already too much for him.", "Vulgar Chastity and Exploding Patience stopped flying as soon as they discovered Seol Jihu.", "The two pairs of eyes glistened with a thirst for vengeance against the humiliation they suffered in his hands at Scheherazade.", "Without lowering their guard, the two began to raise their energy, with some distance between them and the enemy.", "\u2018\u2026Do these guys not know what being moderate is?\u2019", "Seol Jihu flashed his fang in a smile.", "Not long after, a human and the Parasite army clashed violently."]}
