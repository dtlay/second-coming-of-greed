Now left alone, an awkward air flowed between the two.", "\u201cUh\u2026 should we go in?\u201d", "Seol Jihu broke the silence first. Yoo Seonhwa nodded. She put on an apron as soon as she walked in.", "\u201cLet\u2019s eat first. I\u2019ll make you your favorite dish.\u201d", "\u201cBut I just ate.\u201d", "\u201cYou can eat more. You lost a lot of weight while you were at the hospital, you know.\u201d", "That was true. Because he relied on medication without eating any food, he had lost close to five kilograms. When he revived in Paradise and opened his status window, his weight had been one of the things that shocked him.", "Tong, tong, tong\u2026. Yoo Seonhwa calmly sliced green onions. She seemed to be in thought, or perhaps she was just concentrating.", "Seol Jihu stared at Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s back as she prepared the ingredients. It almost felt like they returned to the past.", "\u2018Baek Haeju\u2026.\u2019", "A gentle smile surfaced on Seol Jihu\u2019s face as he thought about his first meeting with her in Paradise. Then he said in a soft voice.", "\u201cHaeju.\u201d", "Tang! The kitchen knife struck the cutting board. Ten seconds later, Seol Jihu realized he made a mistake. He had accidentally said Baek Haeju\u2019s name because he was thinking about her.", "Yoo Seonhwa was frozen, not moving a single finger, with the kitchen knife in one hand.", "\u201cWell, um\u2026\u201d", "When Seol Jihu shook his hands in a fluster, Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s head turned to the side like a stringless puppet.", "\u201cAs I thought\u2026\u201d", "She looked at Seol Jihu with her eyebrow raised and smiled beamingly.", "\u201cYou knew\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was scared out of his mind. Yoo Seonhwa usually put up with his jokes, but she hated it when he joked around during serious times.", "Seol Jihu had to take some time to explain that it truly was a mistake. After the meal, Seol Jihu did the dishes, and Yoo Seonhwa prepared tea.", "Only when they came face to face with each other did the mood finally settle for talking.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot. I didn\u2019t sleep a wink last night either\u2026.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa started.", "\u201cHow to bring it up, where to begin\u2026 I decided to tell you who I was, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be this way.\u201d", "Baek Haeju was an Earthling who was active even before Seo Yuhui. Or at least, that was how it was known in Paradise. She must have been active in that world for at least ten years then.", "Seol Jihu, who was only now nearing his fourth year, already had so much to say, So he could not imagine how many stories Baek Haeju would have to tell.", "\u201cSo I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll ask me what you want to know. I promise I\u2019ll tell the truth.\u201d", "What I want to know\u2026 Seol Jihu pondered before smiling blandly. He couldn\u2019t think of anything. And so, he organized his thoughts and began with a simple question.", "\u201cWhen did you first enter that place?\u201d", "\u201cIn 2013. I\u2019m a March graduate.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cWait, 2013\u2026? You mean when you left for overseas study?\u201d", "\u201cYep.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re a March graduate, that means you entered that world later than Yuhui!\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa smiled.", "\u201cBaek Haeju is a manufactured character. Someone who entered that world before Miss Seo Yuhui would have had to enter in August of 2012 at the latest. There is almost no record from that time left. There wasn\u2019t a Tutorial like now either.\u201d", "\u201cAugust? Not March?\u201d", "\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know. In the beginning, Neutral Zones didn\u2019t open in just March and September. They opened all the time, almost twice a month, and more than a few opened up each time too.\u201d", "Seol Jihu did a double-take after remembering that several Neutral Zones opened up after the valley war.", "\u201cThe reason I lied about when I entered Paradise is\u2026 well, I\u2019m sure you already know. You should know the concept of what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas doesn\u2019t apply to that world.\u201d", "\u201cAh, so that\u2019s why\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAnyone who tried to investigate me, believing only in the rumors that I entered Paradise before Miss Seo Yuhui, wasted their time. Even now, no one\u2019s found out about my identity on Earth.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m surprised you hid it so well. I would think there must have been at least a few tenacious guys.\u201d", "Seol Jihu marveled.", "\u201cThey might have realized that Baek Haeju is a fake name, but that\u2019s probably as far as they got\u2026\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa shrugged.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard. Of the people who entered before 2013, those that survived probably aren\u2019t enough to be counted on one hand. In fact, Miss Seo Yuhui might be the only one alive.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s that bad?\u201d", "\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. People from Earth were cooperative in the beginning, but the situation was ironically the worst as well.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa continued.", "\u201cEveryone was low-leveled, there weren\u2019t any standards in how teams and the general system operated, and countless people appeared and disappeared every month\u2026. Until organizations appeared and Earthlings became established, it was a series of chaos.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded. He could imagine how bad things must have been when Earthlings first entered Paradise.", "On the other hand, he felt a little regret.", "\u2018I should have done it like Seonhwa\u2026.\u2019", "That way, his family wouldn\u2019t have been in danger on Earth. Of course, not that it would have been easy to find a method to change appearances and also someone to help with fabricating a past.", "\u201cAh, about that\u2026.\u201d", "Upon asking, Seol Jihu heard the full account of the Dragon\u2019s Nest Expedition. He then looked at Yoo Seonhwa with a look of envy.", "An artifact that could change one\u2019s appearance, an ancient weapon, riches, and even potions that accelerated one\u2019s growth\u2014Yoo Seonhwa obtained all of these at once.", "\u201cOh come on, it\u2019s true that I obtained a lot of benefits there and soared in strength, but I still can\u2019t hold a candle to you.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa gave a sidelong glance. Indeed, Seol Jihu\u2019s rate of growth wasn\u2019t any less than Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s.", "\u201cYou know\u2026 I always thought it was weird.\u201d", "Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "\u201cI know Yuhui is your friend, but you always came to help whenever something happened, unlike what the rumors said about you.\u201d", "\u201c....\u201d", "\u201cAnd you came to see me often when I was in the Path of the Soul\u2026. I didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to my surroundings back then, but in retrospect, there really wasn\u2019t a reason for Baek Haeju to be so considerate of me.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly.", "\u201cStill, I never expected her to be you. You said you got a scholarship when you were studying overseas, so I always thought you were studying hard.\u201d", "\u201cI also prioritized that world more than Earth when I first entered.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa paused for a moment before continuing.", "\u201cThere are plants and seeds there that don\u2019t exist on Earth. Since the flow of time is different too, I also thought I would have more time to study.\u201d", "She smacked her lips and then continued.", "\u201cThen one day, the organization that invited me was wiped out in an expedition\u2026. I planned to acquire enough materials and retire by 2015. That\u2019s probably what would have happened if I didn\u2019t retire in 2014 because of an unavoidable circumstance.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s eyes narrowed. Seol Jihu\u2019s face stiffened. Come to think of it, there was a time after Yoo Seonhwa came back to Korea that he clung onto her all the time.", "It lasted for about ten months. In Paradise\u2019s time, that was about two years and six months.", "Seol Jihu dropped his head. Thinking about his behavior from back then, he was too ashamed even to speak.", "\u2018Come to think of it\u2026.\u2019", "It was strange how Yoo Seonhwa gave out millions of won with ease whenever he went to ask her for money. Seol Jihu became even more ashamed, realizing that the money he received was the money that Yoo Seonhwa had slowly converted, not to have her identity exposed.", "\u201cTo be honest\u2026 I thought about ending it for real.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s voice turned low.", "\u201cDo you remember what you said to me when you came to see me last time for money?\u201d", "A cold wind blew. Seol Jihu flinched.", "\u201c...Were those Yankees really that good? is what you said\u2026\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s voice turned icy. Her pupils dimmed as she stared straight at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWhy did you say that\u2026? How could you doubt me? I just couldn\u2019t understand, no matter how many times I thought about it.\u201d", "\u201cS-Seonhwa\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI never spent the money you gave me. I kept it safely. I even refused lunch and dinner offers from other guys and professors. I never gave anyone my number; I tore apart any party invitation letters. People even called me a nun because of it! Looking at your pictures and going to sleep was the sole comfort in my day!\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa murmured quickly as if she was talking to herself. But she must have had a lot of pent up feelings as tears welled up in her eyes.", "\u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the only time\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c....\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it\u2026 many times before that\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c....\u201d", "\u201cRather than living like this, maybe I should just kill myself\u2026. Maybe you\u2019ll come to your senses then\u2026. Or maybe we should die together\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu remained silent. While he was looking for a hole to hide in, he scanned the room in case there was anything sharp\u2014for example, a kitchen knife.", "\u201cWhen I think about the time back then\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIs that why you went back?\u201d", "He hurriedly changed the subject. It was because he noticed Yoo Seonhwa entering a more and more dangerous state.", "\u201c...Yeah.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa collected her breath, trying to calm down.", "\u201cEvery time I wanted to kill myself, I kept seeing Seunghae, Uncle, Aunty, Wooseok Oppa, and Jinhee. I wanted to escape reality, so I naturally began to look for a place to run away. I also wanted to relieve some stress, and I figured maybe that world had something that could turn you back to normal\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was touched, learning that she thought about him even in that state.", "\u201cAnyway, I told myself I would end it hundreds of times\u2026 but you know.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s voice came out trembling. Seol Jihu bit his lower lip. He remembered Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s cold break-up words at least a few dozen times. But when he clung to her, she forgave him at the end, trusted him, and accepted him.", "\u201cI thought for sure you were at it again when you came to my cafe\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c....\u201d", "\u201cBut something felt off. You brought money for once, and\u2026.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa glanced at Seol Jihu\u2019s left hand.", "\u201c...Ah, so that\u2019s when you noticed.\u201d", "\u201cI was shocked, seeing a golden stamp shining on the back of your left hand.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa heaved out a heavy sigh.", "\u201cAll sorts of thoughts swirled inside my head back then. I wanted to protect you somehow, but I knew I would only be putting you in danger if I approached you carelessly\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu was frightened as well. If she had really done that, Baek Haeju\u2019s identity as Yoo Seonhwa really might have been found out. That naturally meant danger might have spread to his family as well.", "\u201cSo, I urgently asked Miss Seo Yuhui\u2026.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa slicked her hair back and laughed.", "\u201cBut you went beyond my wildest imaginations.\u201d", "\u201cIn what way?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you think? You kept jumping into the most dangerous situations like you had a knack for smelling them out. Do you have any idea how worried Miss Seo Yuhui was?\u201d", "\u201c....\u201d", "\u201cWhat was funnier was that you succeeded each time. You came back alive even as a low-leveled newbie when even I would have had difficulty achieving success.\u201d", "\u201c....\u201d", "\u201cBut I was still worried, so I tried to pull you out of that world after the first war, but I was rejected firmly. It was a strange feeling, really.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa spoke half-jokingly, but Seol Jihu could not laugh at all. He thought he understood how Yoo Seonhwa must have felt back then.", "The quietly continuing conversation suddenly came to a halt.", "\u201c...Aren\u2019t you going to ask?\u201d", "After a moment of silence, Yoo Seonhwa asked. Seol Jihu raised his head.", "\u201cWhy I didn\u2019t tell you about my identity sooner\u2026 You\u2019re not mad at me?\u201d", "\u201cNo, why would I be? It\u2019s not like I was any different.\u201d", "Seol Jihu never felt angry or disappointed that Yoo Seonhwa did not tell him about her identity. After all, he had not told anyone on Earth about his identity either.", "Yoo Seonhwa gave him a meaningful look.", "\u201c...I wanted to confirm.\u201d", "Then, she spoke calmly.", "\u201cYou always apologized to me, and I always forgave you\u2026. I had a feeling it would be different this time, but I didn\u2019t think I would last if I were to get hurt again\u2026.\u201d", "She spoke slowly and continued with difficulty.", "\u201cSo, I wanted to confirm with my own eyes. Whether you had really changed and were returning to your former self\u2026 or if you were pretending to have changed again\u2026.\u201d", "So I could prepare myself for it. Yoo Seonhwa muttered quietly.", "Seol Jihu closed his eyes. His cheeks felt hot. He was at a loss for what to do.", "He was sorry\u2026 and grateful.", "He felt the same way when he was revived. His achievements in Paradise were not something he achieved alone. He was only able to come this far because of everyone who helped along the way.", "It was thanks to them that he was now only a step away from a future where everyone could smile.", "Of course, that didn\u2019t mean the past disappeared. He could not forget either.", "He knew he had to apologize, but his mouth refused to open from the weight of guilt. It was then.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d", "A gentle voice flowed out.", "\u201cThe reason I revealed my identity to you is that I was convinced.\u201d", "Seol Jihu widened his eyes and looked up.", "\u201cYou know, back then\u2026 I actually cried. When I heard Jinhee over the phone.\u201d", "\u201cHuh?\u201d", "\u201cI was worried, thinking that, after losing your memory, you would go back to the way you were in the past\u2026\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu did not do so. Despite struggling from the penalty of death, he did not fall from the edge and hung on.", "\u201cI still remember what you said.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa tilted her head as if to reminisce that day.", "\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t... I absolutely can\u2019t gamble\u2026\u201d", "She closed her eyes, speaking softly as if to savor these words.", "\u201cSo\u2026\u201d", "Then, Yoo Seonhwa opened her eyes and gazed at Seol Jihu...", "\u201cIt\u2019s okay now.\u201d", "She made a sweet, relieved smile that showed her satisfaction.", "Seol Jihu chatted with Yoo Seonhwa for a long time. Not only about matters of the past but also the future.", "Yoo Seonhwa decided to keep her identity as Baek Haeju for a while. Although she revealed her identity to Seol Jihu, there was no immediate reason to tell everyone else as well. Jang Maldong and a few others had already heard about it, but they were all tight-lipped and trustworthy people.", "Once they finished talking, they decided to go back to Paradise.", "\u201cBy the way, are you confident?\u201d", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "\u201cIn defeating the alien queen, I mean.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled unwittingly, finding Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s description of the Parasite Queen rather adorable.", "\u201cNot as I am now.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa asked in surprise.", "\u201cYep. Now that I\u2019m in a new realm, I can feel just how strong she is. I know she\u2019s bound by several restraints, but I\u2019m still a little anxious.\u201d", "\u201cThen didn\u2019t you set the march date too soon? The Federation said you guys were trying to hurry.\u201d", "\u201cI have a way of making it on time.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke as he took out a piece of paper from his pocket.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that everyone needs an upgrade right now.\u201d", "Seol Jihu glanced at Yoo Seonhwa as he grabbed the piece of paper with both hands.", "\u201cBy the way\u2026 it feels kind of weird talking about this with you.\u201d", "\u201cReally? I think it\u2019s nice.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa grinned as she also held the paper.", "Then, just as the duo tore the paper in half\u2026", "\u201cOh right, Jihu, there\u2019s something I\u2019m curious about.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa suddenly asked.", "\u201cHow far did you go with Miss Seo Yuhui?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cDid you do it?\u201d", "Chwak!", "Seol Jihu finished tearing the paper at the same instant that he was struck speechless.", "Flash!", "The last thing Seol Jihu saw before a blinding light swallowed him was Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s beaming smile.", "Seol Jihu did not go back to Valhalla after entering Paradise. He went to talk with Gula to prepare for the coming days.", "...In truth, he didn\u2019t want to seek out Yoo Seonhwa so soon. She wasn\u2019t with him, seemingly being summoned to another temple.", "In any case, after asking the questions he wanted to, Seol Jihu took the three divinities out of the temple storage and headed to Valhalla. He hummed happily, having received the answer he wanted.", "But when he arrived at Valhalla, there was another joyous news awaiting him.", "The garden was in a total mess.", "\u201cUaaaak! Someone save me!\u201d", "\u201cWhat!? Didn\u2019t you lose your strength?\u201d", "Phi Sora and Hugo were running for their lives with their arms up in the air\u2026", "[You damned black sugar bastard!]", "[You stop too!!]", "And a giant monster bird was angrily chasing after Phi Sora.", "\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d", "[Kuhahaha! Caught you, you little bugger\u2026 Hmm?]", "After finally succeeding in biting Phi Sora\u2019s head, the monster bird, coincidentally, turned to the entrance while raising its long neck.", "[You\u2026.]", "The flailing Phi Sora fell from the phoenix\u2019s mouth.", "\u201cYes! I\u2019m alive!\u201d", "Phi Sora stormed off as soon as she hit the ground. However, the phoenix paid no attention to her. It had discovered Seol Jihu staring dazedly at it.", "\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d", "The corners of Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth curled up.", "\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d", "The phoenix also turned back to a little chick and chirped.", "Soon\u2026", "\u201cYou bastard!\u201d", "Seol Jihu and Little Chick shouted simultaneously and crashed into each other."]}
