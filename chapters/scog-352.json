It\u2019s unlike you to put on such a heavy air.\u201d", "\u201cI had a talk with the Federation\u2019s higher-ups the day before we left Tigol Fortress.\u201d", "\u201cOh right, I heard about that\u2026 Why, did they tell you something important?\u201d", "\u201cIt certainly is important.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded in a big motion and spoke.", "\u201cThe Federation and humanity will soon form a new allied force. To invade the Empire.\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. But just three seconds later, she blinked rapidly and her expression changed to that of shock.", "\u201cW-W-What?

That\u2019s normal!\u201d", "\u201cBut I didn\u2019t give in. I even gave them an ultimatum and said humanity will no longer help the Federation if they do not help with this invasion.

I repeat. We cannot miss this opportunity.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bowed till his waist and asked earnestly.", "Phi Sora unwittingly gulped.

Do you think we came here so early in the morning to listen to your empty compliments?\u201d", "Phi Sora growled.", "Chohong glared at her threateningly, but Seol Jihu raised his hands, knowing that he sinned.", "\u201cAlright, alright. Then should we first take a look at this box?\u201d", "Thud. Seol Jihu placed down a large box on the table, drawing everyone\u2019s eyes to it.", "The box was rather heavy and was separated into four compartments.", "\u201cI\u2019ll open it up now.\u201d", "Seol Jihu slowly opened the first compartment.", "\u201cTantan tararan tan tarara tararan, tantan tararan tan\u2026.\u201d", "His humming stopped as soon as the compartment was opened as a brilliant light burst out in the middle of the day.", "The sound of chairs being dragged rang out, and everyone huddled around the box in an instant.", "Maria, who was peeking into the box, raised her head slightly.", "\u201cThis a Sakura?\u201d[1]", "\u201cIt\u2019s a Sakura.\u201d", "Hoshino Urara bounced off her words.", "\u201cHoh.\u201d Maria glanced at her and exclaimed quietly.", "Seol Jihu stared at the two women giving each other a meaningful smile, then picked up the first thing that caught his eye.", "It was a large blue stone that barely fit his hand.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a Thunder.\u201d", "\u201cThunder? That\u2019s the Thunder?\u201d", "Chohong looked inside the box.

Even an ordinary Thunder can easily blow up the building we\u2019re in, so with ten of them fused together, we can only imagine what its power would be\u2026\u201d", "Chohong became a bit flustered.", "\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent present. It would probably be best that we keep this in the organization\u2019s storage.\u201d", "Seol Jihu and the rest of Valhalla\u2019s members nodded their heads.", "Special Thunders.

They must have infused the five Spirits\u2019 power into the Fallen Angels\u2019 feathers. It was probably made for the Archers to use. If you attach it to an arrow, it should be able to borrow the power of a Spirit.\u201d", "\u201cWait, does that mean we\u2019ll be able to use magic?\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea asked with a slightly flushed tone.", "Little Chick scoffed.", "\u201cMagic? No. It would just be a magic arrow. But the effect should be similar.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea showed a rare smile.

Isn\u2019t there anything for us Warriors?\u201d", "Hugo pouted and sulked.", "\u201cWe still have two more compartments to go. Be patient.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed blandly and opened the third compartment.", "Inside were dozens of rough, shining gemstones.", "\u2018What are these?\u2019", "Seol Jihu asked inwardly. Then, he blinked.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 wrong?\u201d", "Everyone else was standing with their mouth agape.", "They all had dazed expressions.", "But that only lasted a moment.", "\u201cThey\u2019re all miiiiiiinnneeee!\u201d", "Hoshino Urara pounced with a bestial howl.", "However, Kim Hannah quickly stretched out her foot and stopped her.", "\u201cGimme!

I\u2019ve heard about them in the rumors. The Federation really gave you all these?\u201d", "Even Oh Rahee didn\u2019t hide her surprise.", "\u201cHello? Can anyone explain what this is?\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked around the room, wondering if he should just activate General Observation, and then fixed his gaze on the sighing Kim Hannah.", "\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 an enhancement stone.\u201d", "\u201cEnhancement stone?\u201d", "\u201cYes.

That\u2019s a thing?\u201d", "\u201cWell just take a look here.\u201d", "Chohong tapped her mace.", "\u201cThorn of Steel +2. It means it was successfully enhanced two times. Shouldn\u2019t you know this as the person who gifted it to me?\u201d", "Seol Jihu did a double-take. Now that he thought about it, that was indeed the case. He had just forgotten about it since he never used an enhanced item.", "Kim Hannah spoke at that moment.", "\u201cFor that mace, +1 doubles its power and +2 quadruples it.\u201d", "\u201cThen +3 and +4 would mean\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThe weapon\u2019s power would be multiplied by 8 or 16. Though, the chance of successfully enhancing an item decreases drastically the more you do it\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah trailed off before pressing her forehead.", "\u201cBut given the size of these gemstones, they must be high-grade enhancements stones at the very least. They might even be pinnacle-grade enhancement stones\u2026 And that changes things.\u201d", "\u201cChanges things how?\u201d", "\u201cThe higher the quality of an enhancement stone, the higher the probability of an enhancement succeeding. For example, with a pinnacle-grade enhancement stone\u2026 imagine enhancing Miss Seo Yuhui\u2019s Proof of Chastity just once.\u201d", "Seol Jihu gasped inwardly. He had finally realized the value of the stones in front of him.", "One would be able to quadruple their weapon\u2019s power with just two successful enhancements.", "\u201cHey, hey.\u201d", "He nudged Little Chick.", "\u201cDream on.\u201d", "But Little Chick was unenthusiastic.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know about the others, but it won\u2019t work for you or that masked woman.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d", "\u201cIdiot, did you forget what your weapon is? The Spear of Purity is a divine spear that has no equal anywhere else in Paradise!\u201d", "\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? To enhance a divine spear, you need a power that is on an equal level. In other words, they have to be in the same league.\u201d", "Little Chick crossed its tiny wings and shook its head.", "\u201cWell, I see a few pinnacle-grade enhancement stones as that swindler said\u2026 but still, it doesn\u2019t even come close to being able to enhance a divine spear.\u201d", "\u201cSo it won\u2019t work?\u201d", "\u201cFind a divine-grade enhancement stone if you really want to try. Or you can just try using these stones. I can guarantee they\u2019ll just break.\u201d", "Hearing this, everyone glared at Seol Jihu like they wouldn\u2019t forgive him if he dared to try.", "Seol Jihu regretted greatly. If he could get a \u2018+10 Spear of Purity\u2019, defeating the Parasite Queen in one blow might have been possible.", "\u201cI\u2019m shocked.\u201d", "Seeing Kim Hannah place her hand over her chest and take deep breaths, Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cI can tell how good these stones are by everyone\u2019s reactions, but is it really something to be so surprised about?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. Enhancement stones are a thing of legend to the Dwarven race. They\u2019re a treasure among treasures that rarely enter the market. They were precious even before Earthlings began to enter Paradise. Both the ingredients and the crafting recipes are passed down only to the head of the Dwarven race. Because of it, pretty much nothing is known about them besides their effect\u2026 To have so many of them now\u2026\u201d", "\u201cHead of the Dwarven race?

He\u2019s the one who gave me this box. Ah, now that you mention it, he did look like a master craftsman\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah marveled inwardly. She knew that the head of the dwarves stayed inside his private, secret workshop most of the time and rarely appeared in the outside world.", "Though it was a long time ago, there was a time when Sung Shihyun visited the Federation to ask them to enhance his weapon and got turned down by Vidalif, who didn\u2019t even come out to see him.", "\u201cAnyway, I will put these inside the storage as well. I will keep them safe on my honor.\u201d", "\u201cWait! What about us!? Don\u2019t we get any?\u201d", "\u201cRepresentative Seol will distribute them at a later time. You see that over there? There are already people trying to pocket them secretly.\u201d", "Maria and Hoshino Urara, who were stealthily reaching toward the stones, flinched.", "Seol Jihu swallowed his regret and reached toward the box while Chohong, Hugo, and the other Warriors beat the two hopeful thieves down.", "Three compartments had been opened, and now there was one remaining.", "Drrk. When he opened the bottom compartment, a flat box could be seen inside. The rectangular box was made of crystal, making it seethrough.", "\u2018What\u2019s this? I don\u2019t see anything inside. Is the box itself a treasure?\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes lit up after examining the box. He thought it was empty, but that wasn\u2019t true. A transparent liquid swished around inside it.", "He became sure when he tilted the box, and a thin, water-colored liquid formed a pool.", "When he opened the box and carefully picked up the content, the liquid flowed down like a waterfall and spread open.", "Looking at it this way, it looked like a cape.", "\u2018Am I really holding this?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head and activated General Observation.", "[Ego Te Defendere]Threads weaved with the leaves of the ash tree containing the World Tree\u2019s will to protect someone. A masterpiece of the ages crafted by the legendary craftsman, Vidalif.Though it usually has the shape of a cape, it transforms into an armor that protects the user\u2019s body upon being infused with mana.It is hard to see unless it is from an up-close distance, and it does not hinder its user\u2019s movements due to its comfy fit.It has a high resistance to physical attacks and \u2018all\u2019 types of magic, and it can cure its user of \u2018any\u2019 status effect under the league of divinity.It has a self-repairing effect and has a disguise function that changes the user\u2019s clothes based on the environment.Lastly, it is infused with \u2018Blessing of the World Tree\u2019, which allows the user\u2019s body and soul to travel to the Spirit Realm for one second, once a day.", "\u201cWow!\u201d", "Seol Jihu exclaimed in awe. He had been worried about not being able to find defensive equipment on the same level as the Spear of Purity. But now, he had an almost omnipotent piece of armor.", "There was no need to hesitate.", "He immediately infused his mana into the cape, and it instantly wrapped itself around Seol Jihu\u2019s body.", "He moved his arms left and right but didn\u2019t feel even the slightest resistance.", "\u201cThis thing is no joke.\u201d", "He exclaimed once more and gave the Spear of Purity a little swing. The thin water-colored cloth was cut like tofu.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was taken aback.", "\u201cDo you finally see what an amazing weapon that spear is?\u201d", "Little Chick snorted from the side.", "\u201cIt could even injure the Parasite Queen, so how could it not cut a little piece of cloth? Now if you understand that, go train some more rather than thinking about enhancing your equipment.\u201d", "Seol Jihu scratched his head as he watched the severed cloth slowly repair itself.", "Despite the armor not quite reaching the league of the weapon, Seol Jihu was still satisfied with it. He especially liked its last effect, sending his body and soul to the Spirit Realm for one second.", "Though it was limited to once a day, it would surely save his life at a critical moment.", "\u201cBlessing of the World Tree\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu examined his body until his thoughts strayed off.", "Now that he thought about it, he also had the fruit given to him by the World Tree and the divinity of Temperance.", "However, there was no way for him to find out what these two items did exactly as not even General Observation could see through them.", "\u201cDoes anyone know anything about these two items?\u201d", "He held the two things in his hands and asked, but as expected, nobody knew anything about them.", "[Un~ The World Tree is a god of sorts, right? The fruit is the essence of the World Tree and Temperance\u2019s divinity is exactly that. Since they\u2019re both related to gods, wouldn\u2019t it be better for you to ask the gods about them?]", "Agreeing with what Flone said, Seol Jihu clapped his hands and gathered everyone\u2019s attention.", "\u201cOkay, we will keep the box in the organization\u2019s storage as Kim Hannah suggested. We\u2019ll distribute the items at a later time, so don\u2019t worry about it.
