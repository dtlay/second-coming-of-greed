Why?", "Seol Jihu raised his hand and shouted.", "\u201cMister Kazuki!\u201d", "Kazuki, who was walking out while looking down with a serious look on his face, suddenly stopped.

Plus\u2026\u201d", "Kazuki paused before unhappily smacking his lips.", "\u201cWhen I went inside, smoke containing sleep-inducing substance and aphrodisiac substance filled the house. It seems they employed all sorts of dirty tricks.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shuddered. Aphrodisiacs were a powerful substance that forcefully stimulated sexual desire on top of deranging one\u2019s mind.", "He couldn\u2019t believe that such a shocking incident occurred in the few hours that he was gone. It was as if he was having a horrible dream.", "\u201cWhere\u2019s Yuhui Noona!?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Noona?\u201d", "Kazuki frowned before seeing Seol Jihu\u2019s expression and straightening his face.", "\u201cShe\u2019s fine.

Troops were immediately deployed, and she was able to hold out thanks to her four guards putting their lives at risk to protect her. Unfortunately, the perpetrators seemed to have escaped.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui had reacted rather quickly. Just like Kazuki said, she must have expected an attack.", "No, that wasn\u2019t what was important right now.", "Although Kazuki said her life wasn\u2019t at risk, Seol Jihu felt like he had to check up on her with his own eyes to feel relieved.", "\u201cAnyways, there are more than a few suspicious points. We chased after them immediately, but they escaped through a carriage waiting outside the castle gate.

It will be fine if it\u2019s just for a little bit\u2026!\u201d", "Kazuki, who was murmuring to himself, shook his head.", "\u201cI heard that Luxuria\u2019s Priests transported her to the temple. Since the attack just happened, seeing her right away would probably be difficult.\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t listening to him at all. The moment he heard the word \u2018Luxuria\u2019, he began to run at full speed.", "He could hear someone calling his name from behind, but rather than looking back, he roused his mana.

Just being near a source of yang-energy might give her a seizure. We barely managed to calm her down. Do you really want to barge in there and mess that up?\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t make any excuses when the reason he was being refused was because of health concerns.", "\u201c\u2026I understand. My apologies.\u201d", "In the end, he couldn\u2019t find the right words to say and simply turned back.", "\u201cI understand how you feel, but don\u2019t cause any unnecessary ruckus. You aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s on the verge of exploding with rage.\u201d", "Leaving behind the woman gritting her teeth, Seol Jihu trudged down the stairs and saw Jang Maldong hurriedly running up.", "\u201cLet\u2019s head back.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThere is nothing you can do now other than wait.\u201d", "Seol Jihu knew what he meant.

He couldn\u2019t believe that Seo Yuhui, who was one of the living legends of Paradise, was almost assassinated so easily.", "It didn\u2019t seem like Seol Jihu would budge until he heard an acceptable answer. In the end, Jang Maldong sighed after staring at him for a long time.", "Then, he started speaking.", "*", "Seol Jihu\u2019s steps looked dangerous on his way back to Carpe Diem\u2019s office.

She said you would suffer from a guilty conscience\u2026]", "The ordeal finally made sense in Seol Jihu\u2019s head. The enemy must have received information about Seo Yuhui\u2019s critical injury and attacked her while she was weak.", "\u2018But why\u2026?\u2019", "After reaching the office, Seol Jihu stared at the building on the opposite side. He remembered what Seo Yuhui said to him at the intensive care unit.", "[I already recovered. I have no trouble carrying out my daily activities.]", "Why did he not notice it earlier? No, did he even give it a single thought?", "Seol Jihu clenched his fists as he walked up the stairs. Thinking about it now, there was no way Seo Yuhui would be perfectly fine.", "But he had no idea about her condition and kept visiting her lightheartedly. He shuddered at his own stupidity.", "Breathing hard, he opened the door. Bright light struck his eyes.", "There were two people sitting on the couch. Chohong was collapsed and wheezing with a reddened face, while Phi Sora was silently drinking liquor by herself.", "Their eyes met briefly. Then, just as Seol Jihu was about to pass by\u2014", "\u201cDon\u2019t waver.\u201d", "An indifferent voice grabbed his ankles.", "\u201cThe idiots who threw a fit at the pub should only be the tail. A tail can always be cut off.\u201d", "Seol Jihu slowly turned to face Phi Sora. She took her mouth off the liquor bottle and burped.", "\u201cTheir goal is to agitate you.

You think of me as a bull too?\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared fixedly at the sniggering Phi Sora. He did see her as a bull in the past. In a way, her actions were often straightforward and bull-like as well.", "\u201cMy brothers and sisters from White Rose never called me that once. And that\u2019s the same now.\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu had a different impression of her now. To be more precise, he saw her in a new light ever since they talked at the restaurant.", "\u201cYou know, once I got strong and started making a name for myself, annoying flies started to approach me. Like those idiots from today.\u201d", "Phi Sora forced out a smile.", "\u201cHah. It\u2019s absurd even now\u2026. Anyways, back then, I didn\u2019t hold back. At times, I cursed them out much harsher than they insulted me. At other times, I beat them up to a pulp.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAnd before I noticed, I\u2019d gained the title \u2018scumbag\u2019.

If you become agitated over things like this, you won\u2019t last long in Paradise because you\u2019ll tire yourself out.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head without saying a word. Then, he went back to his room and lay down on his bed.

Only now did Seol Jihu realize that he had been in this state the entire time.", "Enduring wasn\u2019t hard. Waiting and seeing how things develop was certainly an option.", "The problem was that his brain wouldn\u2019t stop thinking and raised endless questions.

While walking in circles around his room, he suddenly caught sight of a stack of papers.", "These were the records that Ian left behind, something that Jang Maldong told him to take a day off and read.", "Fixing his gaze on the records, Seol Jihu grabbed them as though he was entranced. He sat down on his desk and gently caressed the faded cover. He looked pensive as he moved his hand vacantly.", "\u2018If only Master Ian were here\u2026.\u2019", "After a moment of nostalgia, Seol Jihu slowly flipped the first page.
