{"cid": "344", "title": "Chapter 344. Comeback (2)", "content": ["\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve met a guy who learned Intuition.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun murmured in surprise.", "\u201cEven Haeju couldn\u2019t learn that skill\u2026. Looks like yours is pretty high level too.\u201d", "He also glanced at Philip Muller, whose eyes were split open in shock.", "After showing a faint hint of regret, he vanished like smoke before appearing next to Vulgar Chastity a second later.", "\u2014You\u2026", "\u201cC\u2019mon, your knight in shining armor is here to save you. You should be looking at me with dreamy eyes full of hearts.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun sniggered.", "Vulgar Chastity\u2019s tense shoulders relaxed, and she let out a sigh of relief.", "Sung Shihyun. Although he had trouble controlling his divinity at the moment, at a time when the Seventh Army Commander had likely been defeated, he was the Parasites\u2019 strongest card.", "\u2014T-Thanks. Let\u2019s hurry.", "\u201cNah, wait a bit, girl. I haven\u2019t seen them in a while. Let me at least say \u2018hi\u2019.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun turned his gaze, snickering.", "Seol Jihu carefully observed the man who appeared out of nowhere. From the looks of it, he seemed to be on the Parasites\u2019 side. But he was clearly a human being.", "Seol Jihu looked around just to be sure, and lo and behold, some of the others looked greatly shocked.", "Agnes and Philip Muller couldn\u2019t close their dropped jaws. Baek Haeju and Seo Yuhui\u2019s faces were especially a sight to behold.", "\u201cYo.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun said with a beaming smile.", "\u201cThis is where everyone was? It\u2019s been a whi\u2014\u201d", "He cut himself short in the middle of his sentence and swung his longsword to the left like a flash of lightning.", "Clang!", "The blade struck an ice spike that sprouted from the air and aimed for his head.", "As he tightened his grip on his sword, cracks appeared on the ice before it shattered into thousands of pieces.", "\u201cWho did that? I bet you\u2019re one of those people who attacks someone when they\u2019re transforming.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun then glanced at Eun Yuri, who was floating in the air like him.", "His scowling eyes widened to a circle.", "Being scanned from the face all the way down to the feet with such an obvious glance, both Roselle and Eun Yuri felt chills run down their backs.", "They had a peculiar feeling similar to a worm crawling on their skin.", "\u2018Iya~\u2019", "Sung Shihyun couldn\u2019t hide his shock.", "\u201cSo many that are my type\u2026 Alright, I\u2019ve decided. I\u2019ll let you be Fourth.\u201d", "\u2014Fourth?", "\u201cYou must have heard of the saying, a hero likes many women. For someone like me, having several concubines is a given.\u201d", "\u2014\u2026So you\u2019re saying.", "Roselle\u2019s long, slender eyebrows furrowed to a scowl. She looked as though she had been greatly insulted.", "\u2014I\u2019ve been chosen to be your fourth concubine?", "\u201cOh! So you\u2019re not just a pretty face. That\u2019s right. You can think of it as me calling dibs. I like intelligent women.\u201d", "Roselle looked dumbfounded, but Sung Shihyun blabbered on, not caring in the slightest.", "\u201cYou\u2019re more than qualified to compete for the wife position. That\u2019s why you\u2019re Fourth. For the record, Third is Haramark\u2019s princess. The two of you can have fun working this out.\u201d", "Roselle stared at the babbling young man and asked.", "\u2014I can curse you out, right?", "\u201cOf course, go ahead. You\u2019re more than welcome to. That makes me all the more passionate.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun chattered on.", "\u2014Even though you look totally normal\u2026 Sigh. This is our first meeting, but I can tell what kind of person you are, no, were.", "Roselle sighed quietly while looking at the young man speechlessly. She crossed her arms and gave him a pitying look.", "\u2014A talented, competent man, who lacks character and feeds off of his own pride. I\u2019ve seen many people like this, and their endings are often the same. They wander around unable to find a place for themselves, until being used as a rag and then ultimately being thrown away. Ah, what a pitiful, moronic life~", "\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun snickered.", "\u2014Am I?", "\u201cYep. Because I wasn\u2019t thrown away. I left on my own.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun looked down.", "His gaze remained on Chung Chohong and Phi Sora for a moment, and then he turned to Seo Yuhui, Baek Haeju, and Agnes and smiled at them one by one.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? First, Second, and\u2026 ah, I haven\u2019t seen you in a while, Sixth.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun waved his hand.", "\u2018\u2026An irredeemable man.\u2019", "Agnes gritted her teeth.", "The other two did not respond.", "Seo Yuhui looked stunned as if she received a great shock while Baek Haeju\u2019s face flashed back and forth between red and purple, as though she was trying hard to rein in her anger.", "Sung Shihyun rejoiced as he saw them.", "\u201cYou guys miss me? I bet you did. But what a shame, I\u2019ve already turned to the Parasites.\u201d", "His beaming smile really provoked one\u2019s urge to punch him.", "\u201cSee, you should\u2019ve treated me better when you had the chance. What, you really thought I wouldn\u2019t turn to the Parasites? Really?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was taken aback as he saw the snickering young man.", "He seemed to be Sung Shihyun, one of the legendary Earthlings. Although Seol Jihu had heard of his name several times before, he was giving off a different vibe than what Seol Jihu anticipated.", "To put it into words, Seol Jihu felt like he was looking at a manchild who was begging for attention.", "\u201cSo, how does it feel?\u201d", "Sung Shihyun asked with a flushed voice. The answer he was expecting seemed to be along the lines of, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 or \u2018We\u2019re sorry! Please snap out of it and come back to us!\u2019", "Baek Haeju\u2019s throat drew a huge gulp. She took a deep breath, and her flushed complexion subsided quickly.", "Then, she glared at Sung Shihyun with her uniquely cold eyes.", "\u201cWhatever.\u201d", "\u201cWhatever?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. Whether you defect to the Parasites or not, what the hell does it have to do with me?\u201d", "\u201cOoh~ What a strong move. But I can tell you\u2019re mad from your voice.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s just what you\u2019re hoping for. But we\u2019re talking about a guy who has nothing going for him other than his strength. I never expected anything from you, so I\u2019ve got nothing to be disappointed or mad about.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThis is perfect. I\u2019ve wanted to kill you on more than a couple of occasions. Thank you for going to the Parasites. Now I can kill you proudly.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun smacked his lips, perhaps because he got an answer he wasn\u2019t expecting.", "\u201cYour temper hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, huh. Well, that\u2019s what makes you charming.\u201d", "He murmured quietly before glancing at Seo Yuhui, who he designated as First.", "\u201cDo you think the same way, Yu\u2026?\u201d", "He made a bitter expression without finishing his question as Seo Yuhui was glaring at him with eyes filled with disgust and sympathy.", "She was clearly repulsed. She even covered her mouth with her hand and retched.", "\u201c\u2026Disgusting.\u201d", "She wiped her mouth and finally spat out a word.", "Seol Jihu was speechless. This was the first time the kind Seo Yuhui was showing such disgust and revulsion.", "\u201c\u2026That\u2019s harsh. I can\u2019t do anything about it if that\u2019s how you really feel\u2026\u201d", "It must have been a shock to Sung Shihyun as well since he scratched his head hard.", "\u201cWell, too bad.\u201d", "He shrugged as the corner of his mouth curled up.", "\u201cNo matter how much you all hate it\u2014 in the end, you\u2019ll end up pregnant from this irredeemable, disgusting trash of a man. So be good and get along now, alright?\u201d", "Killing intent soared up from Baek Haeju\u2019s body. However, Sung Shihyun trembled as if just thinking about this pretend future made him elated.", "\u201cAh! The same goes for the pretty red-hair over there too!\u201d", "The \u2018pretty red-hair\u2019, whom Sung Shihyun pointed at just now, raised her eyebrow.", "\u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m Seventh?\u201d", "\u201cBingo. I was debating between you and the chick with the mace, but you\u2019re better in my eyes.\u201d", "\u201cAh~ Is that so? At least you know who\u2019s pretty\u2026 Unfortunately for you, I have high standards. And you\u2019re lacking in qualification by a long shot.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry! A snobbish, lady-like maiden like you is exactly my type. Uhehehehe!\u201d", "Sung Shihyun simpered.", "Phi Sora frowned and turned away after spitting on the ground.", "\u201cWow\u2026 I\u2019ve heard the rumors, but this is the first time rumors were underexaggerating.\u201d", "This summarized the thoughts of everyone observing Sung Shihyun.", "Baek Haeju was feigning being calm at a glance, but her throat was trembling noticeably.", "However, she held herself back one more time. She knew too well why Sung Shihyun was saying all this.", "Provoking the enemy was both his strong point and specialty. Being on the receiving end of it for once was aggravating, but reacting to it was the same as falling for his scheme.", "\u2014Hold on, let me lower myself to the same level as that son of a bitch.", "\u2018Hmm?\u2019", "Seol Jihu, who was looking for an opening to sneak attack, blinked in confusion. Baek Haeju\u2019s voice had suddenly rung inside his head.", "Mental Transmission, was it?", "\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about how you feel, but unfortunately for you\u2026\u201d", "Baek Haeju got closer to Seol Jihu before he could even finish his thought. Then, his eyes started blinking even more quickly. It was because Baek Haeju clung to him closely and locked her arm with his.", "\u201cI already have a man.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun\u2019s laughter vanished, though he still maintained his smile.", "\u201cOh? When did my Second learn how to flirt? What, you want me to get jealous?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m just telling you the truth.\u201d", "\u201cHah, don\u2019t go too far. How is he any better than me? If you want to fool me, you should at least bring a guy who\u2019s in the same league as me.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun mocked, but Baek Haeju didn\u2019t bat an eye. Rather, the smile on her face only grew thicker.", "\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. He\u2019s in a completely different league than you. I feel sorry even comparing the two of you.\u201d", "\u201cHah!\u201d", "\u201cYou know, my boyfriend entered Paradise far later than you. But he\u2019s far~ more famous than you.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun\u2019s smile faded away. He remembered how the Parasite Queen constantly mentioned a certain Earthling after he switched sides.", "\u201cHe\u2019s more capable than you, his personality is decent, he\u2019s handsome, and his skill in bed is just\u2026 Ah, I guess I don\u2019t know about the last one since I\u2019ve never done it with you. Though, I doubt you\u2019re anything special compared to him.\u201d", "\u2018Was she normally like this?\u2019", "Seol Jihu was a little surprised seeing the coldly sneering Baek Haeju.", "She was better at provoking people than he originally thought.", "Even the constantly smiling Sung Shihyun was staring with his eyes narrowed.", "\u201cOh yeah, do you want me to tell you something else? Even Yuhui, who you were infatuated with in the past, is head over heels for my boyfriend.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Hah!\u201d", "Sung Shihyun burst into laughter.", "\u201cI get that you\u2019re trying to piss me off, but that\u2019s just going too far. Skill in bed? Yuhui is head over heels for him? Both of you like the same guy? Puhahaha! If you\u2019re going to make something up, at least make it\u2026\u201d", "However, he could not finish talking as Seo Yuhui smiled brightly and clung to Seol Jihu\u2019s left arm. She gently leaned against his shoulder and gave a sweet smile.", "Then, she spoke.", "\u201cShe\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d", "Her expression was that of genuine happiness.", "The smile on Sung Shihyun\u2019s face vanished without a trace.", "\u201cYou\u2026 Who the hell are you?\u201d", "\u201cHmm? What do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were such a double-faced bitch. Weren\u2019t you disgusted whenever you touched a man?\u201d", "\u201cOh please. I was disgusted with you, but this man is my boyfriend. Of course, it\u2019s okay.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOh yeah, remember the Spirit Beasts and the precious medicine you gave me as gifts?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui smiled with her eyes.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t have much use for them, so I kept them in my storage. But I ended up letting my boyfriend eat everything\u2026 That\u2019s okay, right?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter, right? You gave it to me, after all.\u201d", "Seol Jihu coughed.", "\u2018Was Noona normally like this too?\u2019", "He didn\u2019t know how much Seo Yuhui hated Sung Shihyun, but now that he looked at it, she didn\u2019t lose to Baek Haeju.", "That wasn\u2019t all.", "Roselle, who was quietly listening to this exchange, licked her lips. Soon, she descended from the sky, circled around Seol Jihu, and then softly wrapped Eun Yuri\u2019s arms around Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "\u2014Sorry, you\u2019re free to have a crush on me, but I also have a partner I promised my future with~", "The beauty mark under her eye stood out as she smiled coquettishly.", "Phi Sora was sensible. With a grin, she spread her arms out and hugged Seol Jihu from behind.", "\u201cBeeeeh~\u201d", "She didn\u2019t forget to stick out her tongue and make fun of Sung Shihyun.", "With no room to fit in, Agnes loitered around before coughing lightly and gently grabbing Seol Jihu\u2019s sleeve.", "\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d", "Surrounded by five women in an instant, Seol Jihu rolled his eyes blankly. He understood why they were doing this, but he couldn\u2019t help himself from blushing.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "On the other hand, Sung Shihyun\u2019s face was a sight to behold. His face had stiffened so hard that it would shatter if anyone tapped on it lightly.", "Then again, the women that he designated as his harem members were all clinging to another man and taunting him. It made sense for him to react this way.", "Although this was only a figment of his imagination that had yet to be realized, Sung Shihyun was filled with the desire to achieve this dream in the near future.", "If Teresa, whom he designated as the third harem member, was here, that really would have put the nail in the coffin.", "\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun suddenly snapped out of his dazed state and muttered.", "\u201cThat pissed me off.\u201d", "With a quiet murmur, he looked down at Seol Jihu with eyes full of killing intent. If looks could kill, his would have torn Seol Jihu to shreds thousand times over.", "\u201cYou all really are pushing it just because I joked around a bit\u2026\u201d", "A chilling voice flowed out.", "\u201cI was going to leave in peace for old time\u2019s sake\u2026 You brought this upon yourselves.\u201d", "He fixed his grip on the sword while giving a menacing threat as if his pride was severely wounded.", "\u201cFine. Whether you\u2019re telling the truth or lying, I\u2019ll kill that little son of a bitch. Let\u2019s see if you can laugh then.\u201d", "In the next moment, Sung Shihyun cut down fiercely in surprise.", "From the sword path, a wavering, crescent-shaped sword qi shot out and fell sharply."]}
