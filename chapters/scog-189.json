{"cid": "189", "title": "Chapter 189. Intrusion", "content": ["After organizing her thoughts, Kim Hannah took out a paper envelope from her handbag.", "\u201cAlright, give it a try. I\u2019ll support you.\u201d", "Of course, she didn\u2019t forget to address her concerns.", "\u201cI understand the employment contract and a checking account with an overdraft line of credit, but what do you need the company\u2019s cafeteria menu for?\u201d", "\u201cI think I\u2019ll need it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu, who had already finished the box of chicken, took the envelope from Kim Hannah.", "\u201cMy brother is the most meticulous member of my family. He probably has all kinds of doubts, so he\u2019s bound to ask tough questions. I can almost guarantee it.\u201d", "\u201cOh yeah?\u201d", "After carefully listening to Seol Jihu, Kim Hannah suggested a tactic, saying that it was a commonly used one in the company. Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I need to go that far.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that he was meticulous?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d", "\u201cPeople like that won\u2019t stop doubting just from a few pieces of paper and readily available data. You\u2019ll need to incorporate a more realistic scenario. Someone from the company specializes in this, so just try talking to him.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was reluctant at first but nodded his head when Kim Hannah insisted.", "\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it a try. Thanks!\u201d", "\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll let you know when the preparations are done. Rest up until then.\u201d", "Kim Hannah dusted her butt and got up. Seol Jihu blankly looked up.", "\u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. Do you know how busy I\u2019ve been lately?\u201d", "\u201cDid something come up?\u201d", "\u201cYep.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t know about the September Halfway Point, right?\u201d", "\u201cThe September Halfway Point?\u201d", "Realizing that she was talking about the Neutral Zone, he went \u201cAh.\u201d Quickly checking the date, he saw that it was now the middle of October.", "\u201cIt\u2019s already October\u2026? How many people got in this time?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t even mention it. The place was crawling with newbies, with all sorts of childish competitions going on. Well, we all expected it since the number of active Earthlings decreased these past six months.\u201d", "Kim Hannah licked her lower lip as she lifted her handbag.", "\u201cAnyways, if it\u2019s like this in September, I can\u2019t imagine how it\u2019s going to be next March\u2026\u201d", "\u201cNext March?\u201d", "\u201cAh, you see, the recruiters for September didn\u2019t have a lot of time to do their job because of the sudden war. We recruited who we could, but we didn\u2019t meet our quota. And because we were in such a hurry, the standard is lower. On the other hand, we have lots of time until next March.\u201d", "She was saying that there was more time to recruit people and more time to increase their chances of hitting a jackpot.", "\u201cAnyways, the organization that will be in charge of next year\u2019s March midpoint is going to strike gold. Just thinking about it makes me jealous.\u201d", "\u2018Strike gold?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cWait, I don\u2019t get it. I remember hearing that it takes contribution points to activate the Halfway Point. Is there a benefit to being in charge of it?\u201d", "\u201cOh, are you asking that for real!?\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked dumbfounded.", "\u201cOf course, there is! Which organization would spit out their hard earned contribution points if there wasn\u2019t a benefit to be had!?\u201d", "\u201cSo what, they get small bonuses?\u201d", "\u201cSmall bonuses? Think bigger. There\u2019s a reason why everyone is lobbying to take that particular role. Plus, you can recover more contribution points as more people enter.\u201d", "When Kim Hannah began to list out other benefits of being the host of the Halfway Point, the topic piqued Seol Jihu\u2019s interest as well.", "\u201cSo how do you get to host the Halfway Point?\u201d", "\u201cYou have to fulfill a few requirements, but it ultimately comes down to an auction at the temple. Why? Are you interested?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu nodded his head in affirmation, Kim Hannah grinned.", "\u201cUnfortunately, the organization that will be in charge of the March Halfway Point has practically been decided already. Well, that\u2019s only if that organization is interested in it, though.\u201d", "\u201cOh really? Which organization is it?\u201d", "Hearing this, Kim Hannah stared at Seol Jihu fixedly.", "\u201cMm, who knows?\u201d", "She then gave him a wink before turning around and telling him to \u201cthink hard about it.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m leaving now. You don\u2019t have to see me out.\u201d", "Clunk. As the sound of the front door closing rang out, Seol Jihu wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.", "\u2018Is that woman taking after Gula?\u2019", "Why can\u2019t she be clearer about it?", "Grumbling to himself quietly, he turned his attention to the paper envelope Kim Hannah left behind. She was certainly good at her job, as the information he requested was all there.", "Seol Jihu leaned against the wall, then awkwardly examined the employee identification card with his picture on it. He then took out the cafeteria menu and began to memorize it.", "*", "He expected Kim Hannah to take several days, but she contacted him just a day later. Seol Jihu took another day to fully prepare himself before calling her back.", "After a long conversation, he finally set up an appointment. They decided to meet near a subway station, at a coffee shop in front of Sinyoung Headquarters.", "Ding! Seol Jihu arrived 20 minutes before the appointed time, opened the door, and then looked around.", "Given its location, it was bound to have lots of customers, but perhaps because lunchtime had already passed, there were a good number of empty seats.", "\u2018Is he not here yet?\u2019", "His employee identification card was hanging on his neck, and he was wearing a wrinkly suit. And with the way he put his black bag down on the table, he was very clearly a new white-collar worker.", "How much time went by?", "Ding! While Seol Jihu was waiting with two cups of black coffee in front of him, the door opened with a jingle.", "A handsome, bespectacled man wearing a white sweater walked in with a straight posture. Seol Jihu immediately stood up.", "\u201cHyung.\u201d", "When he raised his hand and called out, Seol Wooseok paused. Then, he walked straight over to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cYou\u2026\u201d", "Glancing at the young man up and down, he frowned.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that suit?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu tilted his head in confusion, Seol Wooseok sighed.", "\u201cI know you live alone, but you should at least iron your clothes. If a newcomer goes to work like that, the senior employees will badmouth you.\u201d", "\u201cOh\u2026 um, I\u2019ve just been too busy lately\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed awkwardly.", "Seol Wooseok snorted, then moved the coffee in front of him to the side before sitting down.", "When Seol Jihu sat down as well, he cut to the chase.", "\u201cI heard yesterday\u2026 but is it true? You really got in Sinyoung?\u201d", "Seol Jihu took out his contract. Seol Wooseok studied it carefully, then murmured while nodding his head.", "\u201cWell\u2026 you did graduate from Soyoung University with good grades\u2026.\u201d", "He asked a sudden question.", "\u201cHave you had lunch?\u201d", "\u201cI did. At the company cafeteria.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you eat?\u201d", "\u201cSamgyetang.\u201d[1]", "As Seol Jihu knew the cafeteria menu in and out, he answered without hesitation. Seeing a glint in Seol Wooseok\u2019s eyes, he smiled on the inside with bitterness.", "\u2018I knew it.\u2019", "Seol Wooseok was like the male version of Agnes. Clearly, he wasn\u2019t someone to be trifled with. Even now, he should be synthesizing all sorts of information to determine the veracity of Seol Jihu\u2019s statements.", "And no one could blame him. After all, it was Seol Jihu who lost his trust.", "Seol Wooseok stared fixedly at Seol Jihu\u2019s employee identification card, then put the contract down.", "\u201cYou said you paid off your overdraft loans?\u201d", "\u201cYep, here.\u201d", "Seol Jihu showed him his checking account and another bank account that his salary got deposited into every month.", "Seol Wooseok took some time to study the accounts. After dozens of minutes, Seol Wooseok lifted his glasses up.", "\u201cYou paid back quite a lot.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been throwing my salary at it, other than the minimum amount I need to live.\u201d", "\u201cYour salary is higher than I thought. Didn\u2019t you just join this year?\u201d", "\u201cWell, you know, Sinyoung\u2019s well-known to have good employee welfare. I got money from overtime work, holiday work, and pretty much any work I could do. They even told me to stop working overtime, haha.\u201d", "After saying that\u2026", "\u201cHyung.\u201d", "Seol Jihu interlocked his fingers.", "\u201cI really didn\u2019t get that money from gambling. I worked for it fair and square.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t feel guilty lying about working for Sinyoung, but he was proud to say that he worked for it fair and square.", "\u201cHm\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok closed his eyes as if to organize his thoughts.", "It was then. A person sitting at a nearby table watching the two brothers with interest stealthily got up and left.", "And soon, the door opened, and a woman walked in.", "She was wearing a white, long sleeveless dress that outlined her slim figure, a grey thin trench coat, and stiletto heels.", "The woman walked as if to show off her long legs and waved her hand at Seol Jihu. He thought, \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019, but then quickly realized that it was the helper Kim Hannah mentioned.", "That aside, the woman had caught his eyes immediately. She was an incredible beauty.", "Her skin was white as though it had been snowed on, and her long, black hair flowed down smoothly. She was also tall enough to shoo any model away, and anyone could tell at a glance that she took quite a bit of care in maintaining her figure.", "It wouldn\u2019t be an error to call her the ideal representation of a beauty. Not to mention, she was surrounded by a cool, autumn-air-like cozy atmosphere\u2026.", "In any case, she was the type of woman Seol Jihu would pounce on without hesitation.", "But when the woman lowered her hand, Seol Jihu felt that something was off. As he was expecting a department chief to show up, he was thrown off by how young she was.", "\u2018Come to think of it, she looks kind of like Miss Yun Seora\u2026.\u2019", "\u201cMister Jihu?\u201d", "At that moment, the woman called his name and walked over with a bright smile. Seol Wooseok opened his eyes and turned around.", "\u201cThis is where you were. \u2026?\u201d", "When she met Seol Wooseok\u2019s gaze, her eyes widened and her feet came to a pause.", "\u201cOh, you were talking with someone.\u201d", "\u201cAh, yes.\u201d", "\u201cAnd this is\u2026?\u201d", "He wasn\u2019t quite sure what was going on, but he quickly decided to play along and got up from his seat.", "After secretly glancing back and forth between the two, Seol Wooseok got up as well.", "\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Jihu\u2019s older brother.\u201d", "When he offered a greeting with a deep voice, the woman exclaimed in surprise.", "\u201cAh! Ah~ I see. I thought\u2026 ah, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d", "When the woman opened her small handbag, Seol Wooseok reached into his wallet as if he was used to such a situation. After the two exchanged their business cards, they reacted similarly.", "The only difference was how strong their reaction was.", "Seol Wooseok\u2019s eyes widened to a circle, but the woman only had her grin change to nothing.", "\u201cYou work at Haesol Research Institute?\u201d", "Seol Wooseok looked taken aback, but he quickly recovered. The woman put the business card in her handbag and smiled brightly.", "\u201cThen you might have heard of me.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 heard of your name.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s the same. Wow, what a small world! To think Chief Seol from Haesol Research Institute was Mister Jihu\u2019s brother.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s interest was piqued, seeing the woman and his brother talk like they knew each other.", "\u201cI was wondering where he learned to work with such passion. Now I know.\u201d", "\u201cYou flatter me. I should be thanking you for taking care of my foolish brother.\u201d", "\u201cFoolish? That\u2019s funny.\u201d", "The woman raised her voice slightly.", "\u201cI think hiring Mister Jihu was the best thing Sinyoung\u2019s done this year.\u201d", "She gave him the highest praise possible.", "Knowing who the woman was, Seol Wooseok couldn\u2019t hide his shock.", "The woman stepped closer to the blankly staring Seol Jihu and gently grabbed his arm.", "\u201cWhat he has done for us this time is priceless. He played a pivotal role in successfully negotiating the terms for a huge project.\u201d", "\u201cIs that true?\u201d", "\u201cYes. The project was almost canceled several times, but he ran around saying he would do something about it, and lo and behold, he really did it! We were all surprised when he said he managed to get the deal.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok sent Seol Jihu a surprised look.", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly on the inside.", "If the huge project referred to the war and the success referred to killing an Army Commander, then she wasn\u2019t exactly wrong.", "\u201cHe\u2019s our company\u2019s treasure. Truly.\u201d", "The giggling woman locked her arm with Seol Jihu, then tilted her head.", "\u201cBut Mister Jihu, lunchtime is already over. Are you sure you can be fooling around here?\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu was at a loss for words, the woman giggled again.", "\u201cI\u2019m kidding, geez! You just finished a huge deal. Of course, you can rest!\u201d", "\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll head back soon.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really. I\u2019m about to go to the sauna too. When else would we be able to rest?\u201d", "She suddenly broached another topic.", "\u201cOh, do you want to go out for dinner tonight after work? I know a good sushi place.\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cJust kidding. The samgyetang we had for lunch was so good that I ended up eating two bowls. I\u2019m still stuffed.\u201d", "The grinning woman then turned to Seol Wooseok and said how his brother\u2019s funny reactions always made her want to tease him more.", "Seol Wooseok laughed and played it off, but it was clear that he still had doubts. But a glint did flicker in his eyes for a second when he heard the word samgyetang.", "\u201cAh~ I\u2019m sorry for bothering you two.\u201d", "The woman reined in her laughter, then gently tapped Seol Jihu\u2019s shoulder.", "\u201cYou can go home early today. I\u2019ll let Director Kim know.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNo, go home and enjoy dinner with your family. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been a while. How can you work overtime every day?\u201d", "With a broad grin, the woman lightly bowed to Seol Wooseok and left the coffee shop.", "The moment the bell on the door rang, Seol Wooseok heaved out the breath he had been holding in.", "\u201cWhew\u2026.\u201d", "He rubbed his forehead and slumped down on his seat. He then asked the young man who was still staring at the door.", "\u201cYou\u2026 what happened?\u201d", "1. Chicken soup with ginseng. "]}
