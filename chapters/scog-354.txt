Well, tell me how you feel. I\u2019m ready to hear the speech of the great war hero.\u201d", "\u201cOh come on. Not you too, Master. Everyone\u2019s exaggerating. The first thing I did today when I woke up this morning was to thank god for being alive.\u201d", "\u201cHuhu. I guess that isn\u2019t much of a surprise, considering everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d", "Seol Jihu and Jang Maldong smiled at each other.", "Whatever the reason, talking to his master calmed Seol Jihu down.", "\u201cBy the way, is something troubling you?\u201d", "Seol Jihu flinched.", "He was being careful not to reveal his worries, but Jang Maldong saw right through him.", "\u201cYou just won a very difficult war and achieved all you wanted. So there shouldn\u2019t be much for you to worry about right now.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated.\u201d", "Seol Jihu muttered, slowly averting his eyes.", "\u201cComplicated how?

The essence of the World Tree is fine, but I\u2019m not sure how we can utilize Temperance\u2019s divinity.\u201d", "\u201cRight? We need tremendous holy power to revive a god, but I don\u2019t think we can gather the amount needed.\u201d", "\u201cIf the Seven Gods feel burdened by the amount, it must really be a lot. Perhaps we should just keep it for now. We might come across offerings holding large amounts of holy power later. Or it could be useful when we need a huge amount of contribution points in a short period of time.\u201d", "\u201cI agree with you. I\u2019ll discuss it with the rest and store it away.\u201d", "\u201cYou must keep a close eye on it. It cannot fall into the hands of the Parasites ever again.\u201d", "\u201cOf course. I\u2019m going to keep it inside the temple storage.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded at Jang Maldong.", "\u201cThat should be safe enough. Anyhow, about your level\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong stroked his chin.", "\u201cI can see why you\u2019re troubled. You haven\u2019t fully mastered Level 5, and suddenly the path to Level 7 opened up\u2026.

Are you planning on using that?\u201d", "\u201cYes, I think it\u2019s the right time. The war convinced me that I needed it. What do you think?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked cautiously.", "\u201cNot a bad idea.\u201d", "Contrary to Seol Jihu\u2019s expectations, Jang Maldong answered without hesitation.", "\u201cIn fact, I was thinking the same thing. It would\u2019ve been a waste to use it at a lower level. But now that you\u2019re a Unique Ranker, things are different.\u201d", "\u201cYou think so?\u201d", "\u201cYes, but you must brace yourself.\u201d", "Jang Maldong continued.", "\u201cLevel 5 to Level 7. The trial will be proportionately difficult because the power you seek is so great. Will you be able to stand it?\u201d", "\u201cDo I have a choice? Actually, I\u2019d like to spend some time preparing for the trial\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure where to start.\u201d", "Seol Jihu gazed at Jang Maldong with eyes burning with passion.", "He was seeking advice.", "\u201cHere\u2019s the first thing you should do.\u201d", "Jang Maldong gave a little smirk.", "\u201cYou need to rest.\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cN-Nothing. It just feels weird to hear you say that I need to rest\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you many times before that rest is also an essential part of training?\u201d", "Jang Maldong smiled faintly.", "\u201cOf course there are times when you must push yourself beyond your limits. But you\u2019ve done enough of that already. All throughout the war, up until just a few days ago.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cYou look fine on the outside, but you know that\u2019s not really the case. You\u2019re exhausted both physically and mentally. Am I wrong?\u201d", "Seol Jihu remained silent.", "Jang Maldong stared at him, then emphasized again.", "\u201cIf you continue to pull on a rope that\u2019s already too tight, you\u2019ll just end up breaking it. You need to loosen it a little and give it some time to recover so as to extend it longer the next time you pull it. So for now, take rest and recharge. Training comes after that.\u201d", "Seol Jihu let out a deep sigh.", "He wanted to refute but couldn\u2019t find the right words.", "\u201cAnd\u2026 you\u2019ve been here too long.

It\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d", "\u201cUh\u2026 I mean, of course as an Earthling I have to establish a secure access environment\u2026 but I think I\u2019ve already done enough.

No. Not yet.\u201d", "\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s go for dinner. Why don\u2019t we eat out today? We haven\u2019t done that in a while.
