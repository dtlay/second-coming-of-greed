{"cid": "378", "title": "Chapter 378. Thank You (2)", "content": ["Seol Jihu entered the final trial at last. Just like the previous two trials, repetitive days began once again.", "He learned a few things about the Chamber of Void while climbing the third peak endlessly.", "The first was that it wasn\u2019t just his five senses that was being limited. Rather, everything around him was disappearing. Not only the slope but even the boulder he was pushing vanished. With his sense of touch gone, he could no longer tell if he was even climbing up a slope or walking on flat ground.", "The same applied to his sense of time. With everything going to void, he had no way of feeling the flow of time.", "But what he could be sure about was that there was no end in sight, even though he walked long enough to climb both the first and second peaks.", "He only suffered endlessly in never-ending illusions.", "[Jihu, Jihu\u2026 Please\u2026!]", "Seeing his older brother collapsed on the ground, groaning, a scorching flame surged up inside his heart and lit his body aflame.", "[Oppa! Oppppaaa! Don\u2019t goooo!]", "When he ran away, leaving behind his younger sister who fell while chasing after him, a poison provoking vicious pain seeped into his veins, and a cold chill invaded his bones.", "[\u2026What? Yankee\u2026?]", "His heart shrunk whenever he met Yoo Seonhwa until it finally shattered into a million pieces along with his body.", "[What happened to you, Jihu\u2026?]", "When he saw his mother crying in front of a spilled dinner table, never mind being heartbroken, he felt like his bones and flesh were being crushed to pieces.", "[Jihu\u2026 your dad\u2026 just can\u2019t understand\u2026. It\u2019s too painful\u2026]", "Seeing his father, murmuring helplessly with his head and shoulders hanging, an irresistible listlessness swept over Seol Jihu.", "He had to die countless times in this trial as well. When he could no longer bear the fatigue and collapsed, he would find himself at the starting point once he woke up.", "According to Black Seol Jihu, he had collapsed on the slope and was promptly crushed to death by the boulder.", "To be honest, this pain was nothing. Though it hurt, he had built up a strong resistance to pain from repeatedly dying for close to five years. All he had to do was accept it as something he deserved for his past sins.", "However, what tormented him the most was that, inside the Chamber of Void, he was blurting out things against his will.", "\u201cRetard. Why the hell did you come at me for? Especially if you\u2019re going to get knocked out by a single punch.\u201d", "\u201cHehe, operation success. I should be able to get a good number of buy-ins with this, right?\u201d", "\u201cIya, Yoo Seonhwa. You\u2019ve changed a lot after coming back from your overseas study. What, were those Yankees really that good? Hmm?\u201d", "\u201cNo, father, I quit gambling. I\u2019m trying to work hard, so why can\u2019t you lend me some money to start my business? Is it because you think I\u2019m going to use it to gamble?\u201d", "There was no pain since he was acting against his will, but the reproduction of the past when he was a piece of trash only gave him indescribable shame and regret.", "This can\u2019t go on. I can\u2019t do this. I have to climb silently, but I\u2019m not able to.", "Seol Jihu began to put in a great amount of effort.", "To try to change these illusions.", "\u2018No.\u2019", "The illusions didn\u2019t change.", "What had to change was he, himself.", "And so, he tried his damnedest to speak.", "And one day, a small change occurred.", "\u201cFuck off, will ya? Just when I was getting luc\u2026 ah, euu\u2026\u201d", "\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll just double up a couple of times and buy her something bet\u2026 s, so, sor\u2026\u201d", "His mouth still moved as it wanted. However, a groan-like mumbling began to mix into his words.", "\u201cWhat, were those yank\u2026 no\u2026 Se, Seonhwa\u2026\u201d", "And after an unknown period of time, his stammering slowly became clearer.", "\u201c\u2026s, so\u2026 sorry\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 father\u2026\u201d", "Eventually, Seol Jihu\u2019s will overrode his actions.", "He had succeeded in manifesting Perfect Harmony inside the Chamber of Void.", "Once he could talk freely, controlling his body came quickly.", "Seol Jihu no longer beat his older brother or stole his younger sister\u2019s car and ran away.", "He simply walked forward.", "Then, his family\u2019s reactions also changed.", "Of course, they didn\u2019t suddenly embrace him and forgive him in tears.", "They did cry. The problem was that they cried tears of blood and pounced on him like vengeful spirits.", "[Sorry? How can you be sorry when you\u2019re lying again? What? Sinyoung? What a joke!]", "His father rushed in like a bolt of lightning and slapped his cheek.", "[Die! Die! You doubted me, you bastard? I\u2019m going to kill you and kill myself!]", "Yoo Seonhwa stabbed a knife into his stomach and twisted it left and right.", "His mother didn\u2019t say anything, but she stood next to him and stared at him fixedly with hollow eyes.", "But when Seol Jihu didn\u2019t stop walking despite all of this, their attitudes changed yet again.", "[Don\u2019t go.]", "Seol Wooseok spoke while collapsed on the ground.", "[If you\u2019re really sorry, don\u2019t go. Come back and help me up.]", "He then reached out and grabbed Seol Jihu\u2019s ankles.", "[Don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t go!]", "Seol Jihu could hear Seol Jinhee\u2019s scream as well.", "[You said you\u2019re sorry, didn\u2019t you!? You son of a bitch. Was that all a lie!? You\u2019re leaving me behind again!?]", "She ran up to him in an instant and clung onto his arm.", "He was surrounded by spite, anger, and resentment.", "Inside all of this, Seol Jihu quietly smiled to himself. Now, the illusions actually felt like illusions.", "Time flowed like a running river.", "Before he noticed, everything around him dimmed.", "His body didn\u2019t react to pain, and the words of the illusions only wandered inside his head aimlessly.", "Eventually, even the illusions turned faint.", "Seol Jihu was assimilating with the void.", "How much longer did he walk?", "While walking forward with his head down like a criminal, Seol Jihu suddenly looked up, blinking.", "\u2018Light\u2026?\u2019", "A clear light blinded his sight.", "As he narrowed his eyes, he could see a shining light in the far distance.", "The small light gradually grew in size as he walked closer until, finally, it expanded to the size of a portal.", "Seol Jihu stopped.", "He stared fixedly at the solitary, oval light that shone brightly inside the darkness.", "It seemed what the alert said was true. He would eventually arrive at the exit if he walked blindly.", "Seol Jihu turned around and looked back before heading to the light.", "His grunting father and his silently-watching mother; Yoo Seonhwa, who was holding a kitchen knife dripping with blood; his older brother; his younger sister\u2026.", "The five people who were chasing after him like grim reapers had all stopped and were glaring at him.", "Seol Jihu met his mother\u2019s eyes.", "She was the one that he found most difficult to resist.", "It would have been easier if she cursed at him and caused him pain like the others. But because she simply stood there and stared at him, all sorts of thoughts surfaced in his mind.", "\u201c\u2026When this all ends\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu opened his mouth and said with a hoarse voice.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go back to Earth and call you right away. I promise.\u201d", "And then, his mother quietly took a step back. She didn\u2019t say or do anything else, and her expression was still hard to read.", "\u201cThen\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed meekly and bowed.", "\u201cTake care.\u201d", "He turned around and jumped into the light.", "In the next instant, the Chamber of Void crumbled down.", "\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d", "Seol Jihu exclaimed shortly.", "When he came to his senses, a new scenery was spread out before him.", "No, it wasn\u2019t completely new.", "He had seen it once before with Baek Haeju.", "A flat ground blanketed with clouds, a lofty height that overlooked the entire Path of the Soul, and a lone altar placed in the center.", "[You passed the third trial.]", "Seol Jihu had climbed to the top, the summit, of the Path of the Soul.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t feel anything special. But looking down at the third slope, he did find it a little hard to believe. He felt like he walked for months inside the Chamber of Void, but the distance he climbed was actually quite short.", "[First time taken to pass the trials: 1,672 days 17 hours 24 minutes.]", "[If you want to reset the trials, roll the boulder down the mountain.]", "[If you want to end the trials, please stand in front of the altar.]", "Alerts that were as calm as Seol Jihu\u2019s mind popped up in the air.", "\u20181,672 days\u2026 that\u2019s four years and five months\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu stared at the alerts for a long time. Then, when he finally turned to the altar\u2026", "\u201cCongrats.\u201d", "A familiar voice entered his ears.", "Black Seol Jihu was walking toward him with an odd expression.", "\u201cLet\u2019s say you beat the trials in 167 days. You took almost two months by Earth\u2019s time, but saying that would be too shameless.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed.", "Finally feeling like it was real, Seol Jihu slowly took his hands off of the boulder, which had been like his shadow.", "\u201cYou finally beat the trials\u2026 but what do you think about staying here a bit longer?\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu spoke.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re short on time, and it\u2019s hard to come across a place like this.\u201d", "Right, Seol Jihu had no intention of leaving this place. He still had things he wanted to do here.", "There were skills he wanted to practice, and he wanted to attempt the trials using different conditions for passing.", "It just felt too regrettable to leave like this.", "\u201cI was planning to anyway.\u201d", "\u201cGreat, great. Rather than leaving after scoring 80, 65, and 100, wouldn\u2019t it feel better to get perfect scores on all three before leaving?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head before pausing.", "\u201cI got 100 points on the third trial?\u201d", "\u201cYes. In my eyes, at least.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu spoke apathetically.", "\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s hard to evaluate your performance on the third trial. How could someone who is worse than the person taking the exam have the qualification to make any judgments? At least for the third trial, you\u2019re much better than I am.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu\u2019s words carried a lot of hidden meaning.", "Seol Jihu wanted to ask how his relationship with the family was, but then decided not to.", "It was because the question was meaningless to both Black Seol Jihu and himself.", "\u201cAnyway, try setting your goal to be quicker. 1,672 days is honestly too much. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t have taken more than a minute.\u201d", "Assuming the third trial doesn\u2019t exist. Black Seol Jihu murmured quietly, making Seol Jihu burst into laughter.", "\u201cA minute is too much of an exaggeration. But I\u2019m not really sure what to aim for since I don\u2019t know how long I took to climb the third peak.\u201d", "\u201cIt didn\u2019t take you that long. Maybe about forty minutes.\u201d", "\u201cGreat, then I\u2019ll show you a cool magic trick \u2014 reducing 1,672 days to two hours. Ah, I feel like there\u2019s going to be another bento box if we go down. It might not be a bad idea to eat some fried chicken first.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said cheerfully as he started walking back.", "It was then.", "\u201c\u2026Man, I wanted to see your second record, but it looks like I won\u2019t be able to. Same for the fried chicken.\u201d", "Seol Jihu paused in the middle of pushing the boulder downhill.", "Black Seol Jihu was calmly staring at him with his arms crossed.", "Seol Jihu was about to ask what he meant by that when he noticed something and rubbed his eyes.", "A faint light was emitting from Black Seol Jihu\u2019s body. Starting from the bottom, his body was being enveloped by the faint light and turning translucent.", "\u201cW-What happened? Since when\u2014\u201d", "\u201cSince the moment you passed the third trial and stepped onto the summit.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu shrugged.", "\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Those were the terms of the contract that I made with Gula. That I\u2019d make my exit once you stepped onto the summit with your own strength even once. Well\u2026 this is pretty much where my job ends.\u201d", "Hearing this for the first time, Seol Jihu held his breath.", "Of course, he expected this moment to come eventually.", "Black Seol Jihu was only a remnant of the future or Future Vision.", "He couldn\u2019t continue living in the present with the present Seol Jihu.", "He knew this, but\u2026", "\u201cBut\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke with hesitation.", "\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 too sudden.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean, sudden?\u201d", "\u201cIt is! There are still skills I want to learn.\u201d", "\u201cI already taught you everything. The rest, you can pick up on your own\u2026 So don\u2019t be like that.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu smiled bitterly.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it about time you do things on your own?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shut his mouth. He was already rambling whatever that came to his mind, and now, he was at a loss for what to say.", "Black Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to disappear soon, but I want you to stay here a bit longer. Also\u2026 Hmm, what should I say\u2026\u201d", "It seemed Black Seol Jihu also didn\u2019t have much to say.", "\u201cMan, this is annoying. I can\u2019t say anything that causes problems with the law of causality\u2026\u201d", "He grumbled to himself before continuing.", "\u201cUse your contribution points to learn Dual Spear and Berserk. You remember what I said back then, right? Insisting on learning everything through training is being inflexible. But you should still try evolving your Mana Cultivation to Mana Technique. That doesn\u2019t mean you should learn a Reverse-Flow Mana Technique like me. Be careful, extra careful, when you\u2019re using Thousand Thunder. And\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 I have nothing to say about our family\u2026 Ah, don\u2019t make Yuhui cry. As for Haeju, make sure you\u2026 well, I guess this is irrelevant. Don\u2019t ever lose to Sung Shihyun. Eun Yuri was a good catch. She\u2019s the type who thrives on her own, so you can rely on her more. Be careful of Yun Seohui. And Kim Hannah\u2026 ah, she changed too.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu mumbled and then suddenly laughed.", "\u201cI guess it\u2019s useless for me to tell you these things, huh. The path you have walked is just too different than the path I walked.\u201d", "He then looked straight at Seol Jihu.", "\u201c\u2026You know.\u201d", "He lowered his voice and then continued while hesitating.", "\u201cI\u2019m saying this because I just thought about it. You remember how I said some harsh things to you using the trials as an excuse? I was probably so hard on you because\u2026 I was jealo\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d", "It was then.", "Black Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes trembled slightly.", "His pupils lost focus, his mouth opened slightly, and then his expression faded.", "He swayed slowly, almost like someone who would disappear at a moment\u2019s notice.", "\u201cAre you okay?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Ah, yeah, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu put his hand out while pressing his temples.", "\u201cMy mind suddenly went blank\u2026\u201d", "Before anyone noticed, the light had passed Black Seol Jihu\u2019s feet and was shuffling around his chest.", "It was consuming Black Seol Jihu faster than expected.", "Black Seol Jihu staggered before barely grabbing hold of himself.", "He let out a light sigh and then stared at Seol Jihu.", "\u201c\u2026Did you know?\u201d", "\u201cHuh?\u201d", "\u201cThat life is like a train.\u201d", "This seemingly came out of nowhere.", "\u201cI don\u2019t mean that the world moves in parallel\u2026 I mean that your life and my life is connected like a train. For you, this moment might be the present, but for me, it\u2019s the past. And if the past changes, both the present and the future changes.\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu laughed awkwardly after seeing Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "\u201cKind of random, huh? Still, try to understand what I\u2019m saying.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2014\u201d", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like I have much time left\u2026. Also, well, I know I kind of have a shitty personality, and you\u2019ve stuck with me for a long time\u2026 argh, what the hell am I saying\u2026\u201d", "It was time to part.", "\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve really been wanting to say\u2026\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu looked like he wasn\u2019t at all used to such a situation. He scratched his cheek bashfully and slowly approached Seol Jihu.", "\u201cYou sure took your time, but you never gave up and climbed to the summit with your own strength.\u201d", "With a deep breath, he spoke loud and clear.", "\u201cYou also walked a completely different path than me. For that\u2026\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu stopped in front of Seol Jihu.", "He raised his hands and put them on his shoulders.", "Then, he gently embraced Seol Jihu, who was at a loss for what to say.", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "A tiny whisper rang out in Seol Jihu\u2019s ears.", "Seol Jihu turned his head unknowingly.", "Black Seol Jihu was staring at him too.", "\u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d", "And he was smiling.", "It wasn\u2019t a smirking or a sneering smile like the ones he usually had but a soft, gentle smile.", "Perhaps because the light had climbed above his neck and encompassed his face, his smile looked radiant.", "\u201cWhew, there, I finally said it. I guess I\u2019m really not suited for this. So, don\u2019t you have anything you want to say to me?\u201d", "Seol Jihu opened his mouth and then closed it.", "No, I should be the one who\u2019s grateful. I never would have reached the summit alone. I should be the one to say thank you. For various things.", "\u201c\u2026I guess you don\u2019t. Anyway, this is it. Good luck, buddy, past me.\u201d", "He had to say it. He had to. But for some reason, his words hovered inside his mouth.", "\u201cOh right! There\u2019s another thing that I've been wanting to say! I just remembered it.\u201d", "At that moment, Black Seol Jihu spoke as if he just recalled something.", "He looked at Seol Jihu and grinned.", "\u201cQuit smoking, ya bastard. You know it\u2019s not good for you.\u201d", "He sniggered.", "Then, just as Seol Jihu was about to eke out the words stuck inside his throat\u2026", "In that split second moment, the light completely engulfed Black Seol Jihu and shot up towards the sky.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cWait\u2026!\u201d", "Doing a double-take, he tilted his head up.", "However, the light that was Black Seol Jihu just a moment ago was already disappearing into the distant sky as a tiny speck.", "Soon, it burst into a fierce light like a firework and illuminated the sky.", "Almost like candlelight that was on the brink of being blown out.", "As the light slowly faded away, Seol Jihu\u2019s pupils trembled ever so slightly.", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "When he closed his eyes, the recent events flashed by in his head.", "Four years and five months had passed since their first meeting.", "In a way, his alternate self was the one who spent the longest time with him since he entered Paradise.", "But during these 1,672 days, Seol Jihu never once thought Black Seol Jihu was himself.", "That was how different he was.", "He was strong beyond comparison.", "Seol Jihu was afraid of Black Seol Jihu, annoyed by him, and at times so angered that he wanted to kill him. But also\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u2026He liked him.", "He was someone who taught him passionately like Jang Maldong.", "He was someone who supported him devotedly.", "He was someone who stood by and watched over him whenever things were hard and painful.", "\u2026Right.", "During their time together, Black Seol Jihu was like a reliable older brother and like a close, irreplaceable childhood friend.", "[What do you think about staying here a bit longer?]", "[Wouldn\u2019t it feel better to get perfect scores on all three before leaving?]", "Seol Jihu felt like he could still hear Black Seol Jihu\u2019s voice.", "He felt like Black Seol Jihu would be standing next to him if he opened his eyes, saying that it was a lie, mocking him for being so gullible, telling him to hurry up and restart the trials, and asking him to see if the bento boxes had fried chicken.", "But when Seol Jihu opened his eyes, all he could see was a single alert.", "[Innate Ability, \u2018Future-Gauging Nine Eyes\u2019, which vanished temporarily has\u2026]", "Seol Jihu closed his eyes without reading the entire alert. He clenched down on his trembling lips, almost as if to hold something back.", "How much time went by?", "The cold wind of early winter brushed past the mountain peak.", "After standing for a long time like a stone statue, Seol Jihu wiped his sweat-ridden eyes.", "He rolled the boulder and trudged back down.", "Although he passed the trials, he went back to the starting point.", "Then, clenching his teeth, he began to push the boulder back up.", "In a place that lacked company.", "All alone."]}
