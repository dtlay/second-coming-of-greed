You have to let the parties involved resolve the situation on their own. Of course, you can\u2019t give them too much freedom, or else the community will instantly become a mess.

Then after finishing breakfast, she went to work right away.", "Other than two shorts breaks for lunch and dinner, she spent all of her time working.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but feel bad as she was like a company employee working overtime every day.", "As a result of focusing on administrative work without wasting a single minute, Kim Hannah began to show results in just a few days.", "The first was happening now. Chohong, Marcel Ghionea, Phi Sora, and Hugo had each coughed up 55 gold coins and 120 gems.", "Seol Jihu blankly stared at the gold coins that were delivered to Kim Hannah.

Although its premium label as a Banquet reward would normally make it 30 gold coins, Seol Jihu gave him a huge discount since he was a team member.", "Even this little gesture had Marcel Ghionea feeling extremely touched.", "But because Seol Jihu considered the crossbow a gift and wasn\u2019t intending on taking it back until Kim Hannah mentioned it, he saw the exchange as an unexpected extra income.", "What made him happier was that this counted toward his private asset and not the organizational fund.", "Phi Sora, on the other hand, put the matter aside temporarily. She was almost enticed by the huge discount, but it wasn\u2019t an easy decision to buy a full set of armor plus a weapon.", "In Paradise, equipment suitable for higher-ranked Earthlings got more expensive exponentially.", "Since this equipment was also from the Banquet, the enormous price needed to purchase it all made Phi Sora hesitate.", "In the end, Phi Sora swallowed her tears and returned the equipment.

You won\u2019t be treated as an ordinary citizen, but a noble.\u201d", "Strictly speaking, Earthlings were outsiders to Paradise. Because they were summoned by the Seven Gods, they were almost never mistreated. But while they were stronger in both number and quality, what they could and couldn\u2019t do was strictly separated by law.", "\u201cBeing recognized as a Paradisian will grant you the protection of the law. What do you think will happen if you become nobility?\u201d", "The answer was obvious\u2014 becoming a fish in water.", "Seol Jihu murmured the answer inwardly, but the truth was that nobility was an outdated concept and an empty title these days.", "Most of Paradise\u2019s nobles had died from the long war or escaped. Practically none remained in the current Paradise.", "\u2018So things turned out like this because the royal families tried to replace these nobles with Earthlings?\u2019", "Seol Jihu had the above thought, but he didn\u2019t ask Kim Hannah to confirm his suspicion.", "It wasn\u2019t as if Kim Hannah knew everything about Paradise.
