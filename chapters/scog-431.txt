He could see Seo Yuhui standing in the distance, tightly holding onto the Proof of Castitas.", "\u201cJihu!\u201d", "Seo Yuhui was also looking at Seol Jihu, so she shouted as soon as he noticed her.", "\u201cHurry\u2026!\u201d", "She shouted with difficulty while sweat poured out of her.", "Seol Jihu immediately thought, \u2018Why is Yuhui Noona here?\u2019 But he moved before anything else. They had to get away from here while the barrier was holding the artificial sun back.", "He called Flone, used Ethereal Shift consecutively to get to Seo Yuhui, and then picked her up in his arms before madly using Ethereal Shift again and again.", "In the next moment\u2026", "Koong!", "The sphere shattered the barrier and crashed into the earth. The moment it made contact with the ground, the sphere shone and exploded with incandescent light.", "Flash!", "A blinding, intense cluster of light spread throughout the area in an instant. The light surpassed Seol Jihu in the blink of an eye, exponentially heating the air and setting everything ablaze.", "The saving grace was that Seol Jihu managed to narrowly escape from the source of the explosion while Seo Yuhui bought him time.", "\u201cJihu\u2026!\u201d", "Amidst the glimmering world, Seo Yuhui tapped Seol Jihu. Running any further wouldn\u2019t make a difference unless it let them entirely escape the scope of the attack and its aftermath. In that case, it was better to stop and focus on defending preemptively.", "Once Seol Jihu stopped running, Seo Yuhui immediately chanted a spell, creating several layers of barriers around them.", "Soon, a terrifying heatwave raged. The air boiled, and their skin seethed. Despite being inside a barrier and the heatwave being only the aftermath of the explosion, it felt like they were in a scalding sauna.", "But perhaps this wasn\u2019t so bad, considering that the rocks around them were burned to ashes in mere seconds.", "[Whew\u2026.]", "Flone breathed out a sigh of relief from the pendant.", "[Had we gotten caught up in it\u2026 eck, I don\u2019t even want to imagine it.]", "The world beyond the barrier was still flickering like a broken lamp, even though they had gotten out of the epicenter of the explosion. Otherwise, they would only be seeing the world burn in white light.", "[So there\u2019s an enemy capable of something like this\u2026.]", "Flone murmured in regret while staring endlessly. In truth, she had been hopeful when Seol Jihu decimated the Parasite army. Though she wasn\u2019t sure what happened, with how powerful Seol Jihu became, she felt like they could really escape. However, the might that the enemy displayed snapped her hope in half.", "Seol Jihu took his eyes off of his surroundings and turned to Seo Yuhui.", "After concentrating for a while, Seo Yuhui wiped the sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. Then, she looked back at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cThank goodness. I made it in time.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui smiled sweetly, but Seol Jihu stared intently without saying a word. Seo Yuhui\u2019s expression sank, clearly sensing his gaze asking, \u2018Why did you come?\u2019", "\u201c\u2026Something felt off.\u201d", "Eventually, she spoke in a faint voice.", "\u201cWe ran into the Parasites a few times, but they were all flying in the same direction.\u201d", "\u201cJust because of that?\u201d", "\u201cWe were caught once too.\u201d", "Seol Jihu frowned.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure of it. A flying Parasite looked back at us and even met my eyes. But it ignored us and flew off.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui continued quietly.", "\u201cI had a sneaking suspicion when the Parasites were all following your escape route. When they didn\u2019t bother to search the area, I was convinced\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s guess wasn\u2019t wrong.", "When she arrived, Seol Jihu was surrounded by the Parasite army and was even fighting against three Army Commanders. But what was even more surprising was that Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t losing out in any way.", "\u201cAnyway, what happened? You\u2026 you didn\u2019t use that cube, did you?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head. He finally understood Seo Yuhui\u2019s intention. She must have been worried that he would use the Harmonia Magic Square.", "Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t what was important right now.", "\u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t just deviate from the plan. You\u2019re not like this normally, Noona.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke with a stiff expression. His voice was low, but it seemed ready to boil up at any moment. It was the voice Seol Jihu had when he was furious.", "\u201c\u2026I know. That what I did isn\u2019t right.\u201d", "\u201cSo, you know.\u201d", "\u201cThen what about you?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shut his mouth.", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have broken away from the party if the Parasites moved as Mister Philip Muller said.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui continued calmly.", "\u201cBut you know that\u2019s not the case. I don\u2019t know the reason, but the Parasites aren\u2019t aiming for the stele, but you.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you were trying to draw the enemy\u2019s attention so we could escape safely.\u201d", "She was hitting the nail on its head with each reply.", "\u201cAs the leader of the expedition team, it\u2019s natural that I take responsibility for this operation.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tried to protest.", "\u201cBy that logic, I\u2019m also to blame since I hid the stele in Scheherazade.\u201d", "However, Seo Yuhui replied flatly.", "Seol Jihu shut his eyes.", "\u201cBut\u2026 this is putting you in danger.\u201d", "He sighed deeply and pressed his forehead.", "\u201cYou might die\u2026. No, dying isn\u2019t the problem. There\u2019s a chance that you\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu trailed off, but it was easy to guess what he was trying to say. There was no way Seo Yuhui wouldn\u2019t know what would happen to people captured by the Parasites.", "\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu didn\u2019t answer, Seo Yuhui gave a coy look.", "\u201cYou promised back then, didn\u2019t you? That you\u2019d keep me by your side and make me ramen forever.\u201d", "\u201cNoona, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYep, I want to eat your ramen, so I came to protect you. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Are you serious?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked dumbfoundedly. Of course, Seo Yuhui was only joking, so she smiled bitterly.", "\u201cOf course, I\u2019m kidding.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not like the thought that this was all in my head didn\u2019t cross my mind\u2026. Still, I just couldn\u2019t run away. My brain was saying no, but my feet just wouldn\u2019t move.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cBecause I\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui closed her mouth without finishing her sentence. She then gave a sorrowful smile and lightly pinched the disappointed Seol Jihu\u2019s cheeks.", "\u201cAnyway, it would have been a different story if I didn\u2019t know, but how can I leave my pipster behind and run, knowing the situation?\u201d", "Seol Jihu widened his eyes and stared at Seo Yuhui.", "It was then.", "Guoooooooo!", "The light that blanketed the land subsided, and their field of view broadened.", "Seol Jihu clenched his teeth.", "Should they continue fighting? Or temporarily retreat?", "It wasn\u2019t a hard decision.", "Twisted Kindness had appeared. It would be hard to end this even if they fought, and what would happen if a new Army Commander appeared in the middle was as clear as daylight.", "Especially Sung Shihyun. If that bastard saw Seo Yuhui was here\u2026", "Seol Jihu clenched his teeth and shook his head vigorously. Setting aside all else, something had come up just now that he had to take care of with urgency.", "The mountain-sized flaming orb that Twisted Kindness conjured up had shrunk to the size of a hill.", "Seol Jihu took out a piece of paper from his pocket without a moment of delay. It was one of the items that Yun Seohui was trying to use before she was beheaded\u2014 the teleportation scroll.", "\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here for now.\u201d", "Seol Jihu grabbed Seo Yuhui\u2019s hand and ripped the scroll.", "Immediately afterward, a small light burst out, and the two of them vanished.", "*", "When the explosion subsided, nothing was left in the area. Only a gigantic pit spanning several kilometers remained like a sinkhole.", "\u201c\u2026So we missed them, huh.\u201d", "Twisted Kindness muttered briefly after scanning the ground below.", "The Star of Lust\u2019s intervention was outside of her expectation. She had drawn up her energy to the limit for the first time in a while, so it would be a lie to say she wasn\u2019t disappointed.", "\u2018In any case, that brat really did a number on our forces\u2026\u2019", "Although Twisted Kindness was the one to completely wipe out the Parasite army with her spell, she had been carefully watching the battle from the very beginning.", "Never mind the Bugs and Cockroaches, even the Hydras were toppled by a strange skill, and the Sixth Army Commander was almost killed as well.", "If she didn\u2019t intervene, both Vulgar Chastity and Exploding Patience would have perished here today.", "\u2018The Second Army Commander wasn\u2019t lying\u2026\u2019", "She didn\u2019t make any excuses this time as everyone had fought to the best of their abilities. The fact that they were pushed back despite this meant that the enemy was a powerhouse that could effortlessly suppress an Army Commander or two.", "\u2018A star that evolves the more it is irritated\u2026. Is that why he got stronger than the time we fought in Scheherazade?\u2019", "\u201cAre we not going to chase after them?\u201d", "Exploding Patience flew over and asked while Twisted Kindness was lost in thought.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you see just now?\u201d", "Twisted Kindness replied with a slightly exhausted look.", "\u201cYou and the Sixth Army Commander were used as baits, and I used the strongest spell in my arsenal. Despite all this, he managed to escape from here alive.\u201d", "The Brightest Star, a hero that was under the world\u2019s protection, would not die easily.", "\u201cThen\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll retreat and reorganize.\u201d", "\u201cR-Retreat?\u201d", "The hesitating Exploding Patience asked in surprise.", "\u201cIt is the Queen\u2019s order.\u201d", "Twisted Kindness retorted apathetically.", "\u201cIf I fail, she said the First Army Commander would have been right.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAnd I agree. If we chase after him without a plan just because we have him cornered, we will only be accelerating his growth.\u201d", "She spoke with strength.", "\u201cPerhaps his growth can\u2019t be helped now that we\u2019ve irritated him, but we can\u2019t go on this way. We need to use our resources more efficiently.\u201d", "The Parasites needed a more methodical tactic to ensure the Brightest Star\u2019s demise.", "*", "[Where are we?]", "Flone looked around the area.", "There was no way of knowing their exact location, but it was easy to tell they had not left the Empire\u2019s territory. It was because the scroll that Yun Seohui had was only a short-distance teleportation scroll. It was made to be used in an emergency to escape.", "The silver lining was that they could not see any enemies nearby.", "\u201cDamn it! We have to re-route our path\u2026\u201d", "Little Chick popped out of Seol Jihu\u2019s pocket and turned its head left and right.", "Flone stared at Little Chick intently before yelling in anger.", "[Hey, aren\u2019t you being too harsh?]", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "[Seol and I are fighting with all our might, yet you\u2019re\u2026!]", "\u201cHmph, stupid brat, did you forget I used up my energy going back and forth around the hideout from Via Lactea?\u201d", "Little Chick raised its voice as well.", "\u201cDo you think I\u2019m sitting here because I want to? What do you want me to do when I need to recover my energy? It\u2019s not like I even have time to absorb nutrients.\u201d", "[But\u2026! Okay, fine. Then when can you transform again?]", "\u201cTransforming for a moment won\u2019t do anything. I need to gather more energy if I want to maintain my phoenix form for even an hour.\u201d", "As Flone\u2019s voice subsided a bit, Little Chick retorted curtly and smacked its lips.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient. This battle is going to be a long one.

Maybe I\u2019m too result-oriented, but hey, our reinforcement came at the perfect time.\u201d", "Little Chick then muttered, \u2018Why she came is a different matter though.\u2019", "Flone turned her head.", "Seo Yuhui was standing in front of Seol Jihu, busily checking for any injuries.", "\u201cAmazing.

Let me see your side.\u201d", "It was then.", "Seol Jihu, who was sitting like a stone statue, suddenly shook his arm irritably.", "Seo Yuhui paused in a startle. She looked a little shocked.", "\u201cJihu\u2026.\u201d", "For some reason, Seol Jihu was flushed red from his neck, all the way up to his face.", "\u201cAre you\u2026 still mad\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu quietly glared at Seo Yuhui.
