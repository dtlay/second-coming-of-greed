{"cid": "117", "title": "Chapter 117. The One Who Leads", "content": ["Leader - a word referring to the commander who stands in the forefront; the individual at the center of a community, the one who proposes a direction for members to act.", "That was the \u2018leader\u2019. Then what were the requirements to become a leader?", "Martial prowess, wisdom, benevolence, fame\u2026. There were all sorts of requisites, but all of them boiled down to one factor.", "Strength, eloquent speech, natural virtue and charisma, fame and reputation\u2026. Various methods existed, but in the end, the important thing was \u2018trust\u2019.", "Whether it be fidelity, which encompassed loyalty and faith, or confidence, which instilled confidence in others, a leader as an existence required \u2018trust\u2019.", "Seol Jihu subconsciously remembered Dylan, the brawny man of intelligence. His abilities were top-notch, and he led his teammates with calm judgment even in situations of unexpected danger. Although the time Seol Jihu spent with him was short, the impression he left on him was so great that Seol Jihu still thought about him from time to time.", "\u2018What would Dylan have done?\u2019 He asked himself this question, but he soon realized that it was meaningless.", "Dylan was Dylan, and Seol Jihu was Seol Jihu.", "He couldn\u2019t deny that he was lacking in many areas compared to Dylan. However, he had his own methods. Because he let the situation deteriorate to the current mess, the idea of bringing the team together sounded a bit far-fetched. However, getting started was half the battle.", "He had no intention of continuing this off-hand approach. As such, he quickly began to make his move.", "At that moment, Sophie Chalet\u2019s treatment ended. Her arm had been bent in a strange angle with her bones sticking out of her flesh, but the Level 4 healing spell, Cure Massive Wounds, successfully restored her left arm.", "Just to be sure, Sophie Chalet took out a bottle of healing potion she carried around for emergency situations. As she was slowly drinking it, a sharp voice rang out.", "\u201cThat\u2019s enough waiting. Can you get up now?\u201d Straight Face was looking down at her with her unique narrowed eyes. \u201cYou just lost your shield, so I understand why you\u2019re gloomy\u2026 but stop stalling for time. Don\u2019t you feel bad for the people who have to wait for you?\u201d", "Lara Wolff, who was listening to her quietly, dropped her jaw in shock. She stared at Straight Face with a look that said, \u2018Where did this bitch come from?\u2019", "The human body wasn\u2019t a calculator. Even if it was fully healed, it needed some time to recover from the shock. That was why Sophie Chalet was slowly drinking the healing potion - to speed up the rate of recovery. But she was saying she couldn\u2019t even wait for that?", "It was obvious that she was just being childish and picking on Sophie because Sophie had interrupted her before. With Straight Face\u2019s condescending look and tone, even the most gentle person would get angry.", "However, Sophie didn\u2019t reveal even a hint of frustration. \u201cSorry, we\u2019ll continue right away.\u201d She smiled and gulped down the rest of the potion.", "Lara grit her teeth. She wanted to yell, \u2018Aren\u2019t you being way too harsh?\u2019 However, knowing why Sophie was holding back and why they had to hold back, all she could do was clench her fists.", "Like the saying, \u2018It\u2019s better to be a live dog than a dead lion\u2019, she knew that she would either die or be eliminated the moment she was abandoned.", "Sophie stood up and began to rummage through the wreckage. Her shield wasn\u2019t broken into pieces, but it was split in half through the middle. It was now more like a washboard for doing laundry than a shield, but thinking that it was better than nothing, Sophie picked up the two pieces.", "Immediately, a snicker rang out. \u201cWow\u2026 I\u2019m crying. If it were up to me, I would have just crawled on the ground.\u201d", "\u201cOh? You\u2019re more pragmatic than I thought.\u201d", "\u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. I like pragmatic people.\u201d", "Snake Eyes and Straight Face exchanged a conversation between themselves. Meanwhile, Lara Wolff\u2019s face flushed red as if she had reached her limit and was about to explode. It was at this point that Seol Jihu cut in.", "\u201cI think it will be better for you to throw that shield away. It\u2019s only going to drag you down.\u201d", "Sophie\u2019s firm steps stopped. Her eyes widened as she stared at the young man who gently spoke up.", "\u201cHey! Are you adding fuel to the fire? You think she doesn\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d Lara Wolff blew up and shot back, but the end of her speech blurred off. It was because she couldn\u2019t detect any hint of mockery or ridicule from the young man\u2019s tone or expression.", "Seol Jihu cleared his throat.", "\u201cYou did well.\u201d", "Then\u2026.", "\u201cI\u2019ll take the lead from now on.\u201d", "The moment he stepped out of the sidelines and announced his intent\u2026", "Straight Face, Snake Eyes, Maria.Lara, Sophie, and the white headband girl.", "The two groups showed completely opposite reactions.", "\u201cUh\u2026 um\u2026.\u201d Sophie looked back and forth with an anxious face. She couldn\u2019t help but be flustered when the man who had been silent until now suddenly took her side.", "Snake Eyes also seemed surprised as she let out a high-pitched whistle.", "\u201cOh- so the prince is finally coming to the rescue!\u201d She sniggered in a mocking tone before looking back at Straight Face. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to defeat the witch.\u201d", "\u201cWitch? How rude.\u201d Straight Face murmured calmly. Although she was smiling, it obviously didn\u2019t have good feelings behind it. After all, her eyebrows were furrowed slightly.", "It was the same with Maria who muttered, \u2018We would have at least gone halfway if you just stayed put.\u2019 She was clearly unhappy that Seol Jihu had gone out of his way to intervene.", "Straight Face carefully studied Seol Jihu before the corner of her mouth twisted up. \u201cI thought you were pragmatic\u2026 but you\u2019re surprisingly emotional.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWell, what can I do.\u201d Then, she shrugged her shoulders, glancing at Lara and Sophie before smiling. \u201cPrince Charming wants to get on his white horse, so I should move out of the way, right?\u201d", "She even remarked, \u201cAh~ I should have been born a white girl too.\u201d", "Understanding what she meant, Snake Eyes burst out laughing, while the Warrior and Archer duo turned red.", "Seol Jihu calmly asked, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask you for a favor.\u201d", "\u201cA favor?\u201d", "\u201cCan you take on the position of the keeper?\u201d When he asked straightforwardly, Straight Face\u2019s eyebrows twitched. He was asking her to take on the role of protecting the Priests when the vanguard position was the most dangerous?", "Seol Jihu turned his gaze and continued, \u201cAlso- I would like you to help coordinate from the back.\u201d", "\u201cMe?\u201d Snake Eyes pointed at herself after being singled out unexpectedly.", "\u201cYes, since a trap might activate like before. I\u2019d like you to keep your eyes out for anything that might trigger it.\u201d", "This wasn\u2019t anything difficult, especially for an Archer of Snake Eyes\u2019 caliber. And in a way, this also seemed to be the safest role.", "Snake Eyes tilted her head slightly before yelling \u201cHa!\u201d and bursting into laughter.", "\u201cHyaa\u2026. Our prince is quite a glutton, huh?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t act like you\u2019re not. You\u2019re saying you want to eat those girls and us.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI understand. You\u2019re a man with a dick hanging between your legs. Who can blame you for getting horny when you\u2019re surrounded by flowers? But don\u2019t be a glutton. If you eat everything just because you can get your hands on them, you will only end up with a sick stomach~\u201d", "Hearing her telling him to pick a side, Seol Jihu smiled bitterly. Perhaps because of the joking comment Straight Face made, Snake Eyes was putting too much emphasis on him being the only man.", "But there was one thing he couldn\u2019t deny.", "\u2018Glutton, she says\u2026.\u2019", "And that was his gluttony.", "He could have remained a bystander. Even now, he could abandon Straight Face and Snake Eyes and take the easy way of bringing the other four with him.", "However, that was not what Seol Jihu did, nor was it what he wanted to do.", "The world didn\u2019t revolve around one individual, and not everything went according to one\u2019s expectations. If there were days when things worked out, then there were also days when things didn\u2019t. One could be compatible with some people and incompatible with others.", "Similar situations frequently occurred in life. Was choosing the convenient way out always right?", "\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019", "He couldn\u2019t give a yes or no answer yet. However, he was willing to experiment which one was correct.", "He wanted to test whether his \u2018vessel\u2019 was big enough to contain the two people trying to wander off.", "Right. To be completely honest, he wanted to taste all of them, even if they weren\u2019t to his taste.", "Forcing them into submission\u2026 wasn\u2019t quite the way he would put it. But regardless, he felt like leading them would allow him to taste a special flavor.", "Once he admitted this, Snake Eyes\u2019 food analogy was spot on, and he cracked up.", "And hearing this laugh, Snake Eyes put on a strange expression. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing?\u201d", "\u201cAh, sorry, I think you\u2019re misunderstanding something.\u201d", "\u201cMisunderstanding? What am I misunderstanding?\u201d", "Unlike how relaxed Seol Jihu appeared, Snake Eyes snapped back, \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason you\u2019re stepping up now when you\u2019ve stayed silent this entire time?\u201d", "The question he had been waiting for finally came out. Seol Jihu spoke loud and clear, \u201cBecause of a time limit. Though it\u2019s only a possibility.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Snake Eyes was expecting something along the lines of, \u2018I can\u2019t bear to watch any longer\u2019, and so she couldn\u2019t help but ask back hearing this unexpected answer. Even Straight Face widened her eyes a bit.", "\u201cI\u2019m worried that this stage might have a time limit.\u201d", "\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d", "\u201cCan you guarantee that there isn\u2019t?\u201d", "\u201cOh? Get a hold of this kid. We\u2019re playing with words now?\u201d", "\u201cTwo times.\u201d", "\u201cYou think I won\u2019t\u2026. Hm?\u201d Snake Eyes revealed a displeased expression before hearing Seol Jihu\u2019s muttering and blinking her eyes.", "Seol Jihu continued, \u201cNot including this Banquet, we have records on four Stage 1s and four Stage 2s. And out of these eight stages, two of them had time limits.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled brightly. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a 25 percent chance. I could be wrong, but wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to keep this in mind?\u201d", "Snake Eyes became speechless. With the Banquet being so volatile and unpredictable, 25 percent was not a number that could be ignored.", "Scientia potentia est. \u2018Knowledge is power.\u2019", "If Seol Jihu had participated in the Banquet relying only on his teammates, then he would have been at a loss for words. However, because he had investigated it thoroughly, he was rather knowledgeable.", "And now that he was using this knowledge to convince Straight Face and Snake Eyes, he definitely felt it was time well spent.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Straight Face was showing various changes in her expression to the point she shouldn\u2019t be called \u2018Straight Face\u2019 any longer. At the moment, a hint of interest had surfaced on her irritated face, almost as if she discovered a new toy to play with.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have a choice. If the seven of us work together, we should be able to break through the first stage in no time.\u201d Seol Jihu put more strength into his voice, \u201cAnd even if there isn\u2019t a time limit, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to clear Stage 1 early. That way, we can investigate Stage 2 ahead of everyone else.\u201d", "Seol Jihu had taken a rather roundabout way of explaining things. To summarize, he was saying, \u2018Let\u2019s stop playing around and quickly get to Stage 2\u2019.", "Most Earthlings who participated in the Banquet had Stage 2 as their minimum goal. That was because they could obtain the \u2018Dissonant Wish\u2019 in Stage 2.", "In this sense, Seol Jihu had given a sound argument.", "Right, what he said made sense\u2026.", "\u2018Interesting.\u2019", "But the problem was with the way he put it.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s way of leading piqued Straight Face\u2019s interest. He seemed to be stirring a conflict at first, but he provided carrots in the form of keeper and coordinator positions and offered logic with a potential time limit.", "Straight Face had no reason to go against him, but she was a bit hesitant. She felt like the young man was gently consoling her after smacking her hard.", "\u2018Should I go along with this?\u2019", "She was in the middle of contemplating her decision when her eyes met Maria\u2019s. The blonde-haired girl grinned before stealthily moving behind Seol Jihu.", "The corner of Straight Face\u2019s mouth twisted. A skilled Priest who specialized in healing was siding with the young man. This wasn\u2019t something she could ignore. Although she had a skilled Archer on her side, strictly speaking, it was hard to call her an ally.", "As she was touchy and hypersensitive, she didn\u2019t trust others easily. But even without this, she knew Snake Eyes was the type of person who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to backstab.", "\u201cHnng\u2026.\u201d She gave a condescending smile as if she found the young man\u2019s explanation laughable. \u201cI was planning on taking it easy with you\u2026.\u201d", "One step, then another. She slowly approached Seol Jihu, and then stopped right in front of him. \u201cBut I see you know how to have fun.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu met her deep eyes that didn\u2019t give off a hint of emotion, he felt cold sweat flow down his back.", "\u2018What\u2026\u2019", "What kind of things did a woman need to go through to be able to make such a face?", "Calling her Straight Face was being nice. To be frank, Discomforting Face suited her more.", "\u201cCan you lend us a hand?\u201d Seol Jihu asked in a deeper voice. On the inside, he was thinking that this would be the last time he asked her nicely.", "He had a couple more cards under his sleeve to try and convince her. However, he didn\u2019t want to reveal all his secrets from the beginning nor cling to her desperately. Just like Prihi Hussey said, everyone had a limit to their vessel.", "Perhaps Straight Face felt the line drawn by the young man as she slowly raised her hand and placed it on her shoulder. The way she looked up at him while fiddling with the ends of her hair, she gave off a seductive aura.", "Soon\u2026.", "\u201cMn\u2026.\u201d She breathed out a short sigh before saying, \u201cFine, since our prince wants to look after us so much\u2026 I see no reason to say no.\u201d", "Next, she slowly moved her hand and placed it on her chest. \u201cBut\u2026 what should I do?\u201d", "She suddenly made a fake melancholic face. \u201cThe wound in my heart hasn\u2019t healed yet. It hasn\u2019t been long since a certain someone dug a blade into it.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d", "\u201cExaggerating? I really wanted to get along, but I\u2019ve been betrayed!\u201d", "Seol Jihu made a wry smile and spoke, \u201cThen I\u2019d like to try to soothe your wounded heart.\u201d", "\u201cWith words?\u201d", "\u201cHow many doors do you want?\u201d", "Straight Face\u2019s smile became even deep. \u201cHmm\u2026.\u201d She rested her chin on her index finger, pretending to be deep in thought. Then, she opened her mouth, \u201cForty should be enough to console me.\u201d", "It seemed she at least had an ounce of conscience in her as she asked for the same number of doors she opened initially.", "\u201cFine.\u201d Seol Jihu agreed without arguing or negotiating. With this, he had gotten the biggest problem out of the way. Of course, he didn\u2019t think he did a perfect job. He had only prevented the festered wound from exploding, but that was more than enough to keep the group as a team.", "In any case, he now had a clear goal. The rest didn\u2019t seem all that difficult.", "\u201cAre you willing to help me?\u201d", "Lara and Sophie nodded their heads in a daze. A rope had come down from the sky just when they thought it was over. How could they refuse to grab onto it?", "\u201cThank you. Then\u2026.\u201d", "Currently, Lara and Sophie were suffering from low self-esteem. Since the reason for that was that they weren\u2019t doing much, Seol Jihu planned to resolve this first.", "When the duo heard Seol Jihu\u2019s request, they doubted their ears.", "\u201cThat\u2019s all we have to do?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the fastest way of breaking through the rooms.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I want to get to Stage 2 as soon as possible. Shall we get going?\u201d", "Hearing Seol Jihu\u2019s urging, Sophie hurriedly ran to the door with a face mixed with gratitude and guilt.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me a signal. Just open the door whenever.\u201d", "When the young man\u2019s voice flew behind her, Sophie didn\u2019t stop to look back and grabbed the doorknob. Just as she was told, she opened the door without hesitation. Immediately\u2026.", "BOOM!", "\u201cKYAK!\u201d", "Along with a violent tremor, an explosive sound struck her ears. Sophie was in the middle of backing off but ended up falling on her butt.", "When she turned around reflexively, she saw Seol Jihu with his left arm out as if he had thrown something, and four women whose expressions were like the one she was making now.", "To top it off, even the previously calm and collected Straight Face and Snake Eyes were frozen stiff.", "Sophie blankly turned back to the door before letting out a gasp.", "A huge monster was collapsed on the ground with its upper body blown to smithereens. It had been killed before it could even utter a death throe.", "\u2018That\u2019s one door.\u2019", "Seol Jihu spun his left arm around and glanced back. Perhaps surprised by the power of his Mana Spear, Straight Face\u2019s smile was nowhere to be seen. Seol Jihu felt himself becoming more relaxed.", "For some reason\u2014", "\u201cAlright.\u201d", "The woman who looked so big in the beginning\u2026", "\u201cLet\u2019s keep going.\u201d", "\u2026Now looked just like any other Earthling."]}
