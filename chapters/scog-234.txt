It\u2019s not as if we are the first organization of a small group of elites.\u201d", "\u201cYou must be talking about Balhae. You should know that the organization no longer exists. Plus, they founded their organization with twenty people. Most importantly, Balhae was a subsidiary organization of Goguryeo, containing their most powerful elites.\u201d", "\u201cThat is one such example, but didn\u2019t Nur also have the White-Haired Witch?\u201d", "\u201cThat is Nur.

Ian tempting me was a part of the reason, but this young man is the true reason I decided to return to Paradise.\u201d", "Jang Maldong was clearly backing up Kim Hannah\u2019s explanation.", "Hearing this well-timed support, Sorg K\u00fchne nodded his head before turning to Seo Yuhui.", "He was asking whether she had any input on the matter and that it would be taken into consideration as well.", "Seo Yuhui cupped her hands together respectfully and smiled cheerfully.", "\u201cOur Jihu\u2026 is really kind.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne blinked.", "Then, he let out a dry cough.", "\u201cKuhum, I understand what you mean. I\u2019ve also heard enough about Mister Seol Jihu to make my ears bleed, and the Queen holds great interest in him as well.\u201d", "The smile on Kim Hannah\u2019s face became thicker.", "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to find faults.

Well, she was quite fierce.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne smacked his lips.", "\u201cShe clouded the issue whenever I tried to dig into a matter with a believable logic. She even rebutted every point and shut me up. The way she already had her answers prepared and carefully baited me toward it, it was like I was being played by a vixen. It\u2019s been long since I felt so exhausted from a conversation.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne shook his head with a fed-up face.", "Seeing his tired eyes remaining on his teacup, Seol Jihu reached out and offered his hand.", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a breather? Have some tea.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine.

At least, they would try their best to make you stay. But the fact that you\u2019re still coming to Eva\u2026 maybe it means that there are problems that the public is not aware of. That was my thinking, anyway.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed.", "\u201cI doubt you were met with kind words then.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne also chuckled.", "\u201cFufu, it was a mess, alright. Princess Teresa was especially noteworthy. You thieving cat, where do you think you\u2019re coming without permission. If you dare to take him away, Eva will be erased from the map.

I\u2019m fully aware that she meant it as a joke.\u201d", "Right, Teresa probably didn\u2019t mean it for real, and that was probably why Sorg K\u00fchne was saying this jokingly.", "\u201cAnyway, I know that the reason you\u2019re coming to Eva is not because of some problem. And that\u2019s only making me more curious.\u201d", "\u201cIf I tell you it\u2019s for the sake of Paradise\u2026 would that suffice?\u201d", "\u201cI hate answers that sound like riddles the most.\u201d", "That was something Seol Jihu wholeheartedly agreed with.", "Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "Normally, this would be where he answered, \u2018Because I don\u2019t want to fight with Sicilia.\u2019", "But it didn\u2019t look like Sorg K\u00fchne would welcome that answer.", "So, he decided to give another one.", "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you promise not to laugh.\u201d", "\u201cAs long as I feel that you are sincere, the corners of my mouth will not go up.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne leaned forward in a show of interest.", "\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone yet, but\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu finally revealed one of the new goals he planned to achieve in Eva.", "\u201cIt\u2019s because of the Federation.\u201d", "\u201cThe Federation?\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s wrinkly eyes widened at the unexpected answer.", "\u201cYes.

About the importance of the Federation to the current Paradise and its relationship to humanity.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to even mention it. The Federation and humanity are sharing the same fate. Though, their relationships leave much to be desired.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was worried Sorg K\u00fchne would say something like the Federation being a union of an alien race and foreign races, but it didn\u2019t seem like he was such a stuck-up person.", "Judging by what he said about the Federation and humanity\u2019s relationship, it seemed he knew all about the state of the current situation.", "Thinking that Sorg K\u00fchne was someone he could talk to, Seol Jihu continued his words.", "\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m trying to relocate to Eva is to improve humanity\u2019s relationship with the Federation. Moving past our current ambiguous relationship to a definite alliance, I hope we will be able to exchange more direct interactions.\u201d", "\u201cMm, but isn\u2019t that something you could do in Haramark as well? Of course, Eva is closer to the Federation and has minor conflicts with them, but\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said flatly.", "\u201cThe conflicts between the Federation and Eva aren\u2019t minor at all.

If what you say is true, then I have another question to ask you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t show it in his face, but he was thinking that Sorg K\u00fchne was a little too strict.", "In the next moment, Sorg K\u00fchne held his fists out in front of Seol Jihu.", "\u201cHere are two evils.\u201d", "He raised his left hand.", "\u201cOne side is controllable and seemingly has good functions, but its true nature is evil.\u201d", "Next, he raised his right hand.", "\u201cThe other side is also evil. But this side is a total, irredeemable evil; a gang of racketeers and conmen who pay no attention to the Federation or anyone else and do all sorts of dirty work.\u201d", "He then put his left and right hand together.", "\u201cThe important thing is that these two evils are preventing each other from going berserk and doing as they please. In other words, their mutual existence keeps each other in check.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne asked Seol Jihu.", "\u201cIf you had to choose between these two evils, which would you choose?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "It seemed like a completely random question, but that surely wasn\u2019t the case as it was coming from Eva\u2019s royal administrator. It had to have something to do with Eva\u2019s internal affairs.", "After contemplating for a moment, Seol Jihu decided to answer honestly.
