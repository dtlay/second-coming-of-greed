{"cid": "304", "title": "Chapter 304. Guidance (1)", "content": ["Seol Jihu got busy again as soon as the Neutral Zone concluded.", "\u2018I need to find the spring.\u2019", "He didn\u2019t exactly know what the spring was. He didn\u2019t even know where to look for it.", "He only knew something similar had happened in the alternate future, and Eun Yuri, who was then called the hope of mankind, mentioned that they could go to the Spirit Realm through a spring.", "The future Seol Jihu treated her as if she was a crazy bitch, calling her idea absurd, but the present Seol Jihu didn\u2019t think so.", "The fact that even the Federation had given up meant that there really was no other solution, so the only thing they could rely on was the spring.", "So for an entire month, Seol Jihu poured his time into searching for it, but there were no clear results.", "Despite flipping the library upside down and reading all kinds of books, not a single clue could be found, almost as if it never existed in the first place.", "Whether he asked Roselle, urged Seo Yuhui, or tried bothering the blameless Flone, everyone shook their heads. They all replied that they\u2019ve never heard of such a spring before.", "\u201cMiss Eun Yuri, tell me what you know about how to cross over to the Spirit Realm or anything about a spring.\u201d", "He grew so frustrated that he even asked Eun Yuri. However, there was simply no way the current her would know, so she only blankly stared back at him in return.", "In any case, he was beginning to doubt whether the spring really existed at this point, and he felt more exasperated day by day.", "While Seol Jihu\u2019s worries kept growing, a small wind of change blew across Valhalla.", "For one, Park Woori, Yoo Yeolmu, and Eun Yuri left to follow Jang Maldong to Haramark. It was to uncover their dormant potentials and raise their physical levels to the highest possible amount while they were still low leveled.", "Additionally, three High Ranker candidates were added to Valhalla\u2019s ranks.", "After the Eva\u2019s Night incident, Richard Hugo, Marcel Ghionea, and Maria Yeriel, who all had been standing on the edge of Level 4, finally fulfilled their advancement requirements. Thanks to their efforts in the Neutral Zone, they were successful in earning the contribution points that they had been lacking.", "Of course, it was still too early to be happy.", "They were only candidates, in the end, meaning they had to pass the examination given by the royal family to move up in ranks and become a High Ranker.", "Besides them, the Yi siblings both became Level 3, and there was a slight change in Little Chick as well.", "First, its size changed. It had only been the size of a cotton ball when it hatched, but it was now the size of a fist. Its coat became fluffier, and above all, the trademark feather that grew on its forehead increased from one to three.", "If it only had a single stiff green feather sticking out before, it now had a yellow and blue feather sprouting from the sides drawing a V-shape.", "It almost looked like a peacock.", "However, despite the numerous good news pouring in, Seol Jihu\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t happy in the slightest. He had made zero progress in important matters that he had to urgently solve.", "*", "Seol Jihu holed himself up in his office again and repeatedly sighed. He had returned late at night without seeing any results today as well.", "\u2018What should I do?\u2019", "He looked through the records he brought just in case, but he couldn\u2019t find anything about a spring.", "\u2018Do I give up?\u2019", "He was tired.", "Seol Jihu added another cigarette butt to the massive pile on his ashtray before staring at his desk. His eyes happened to wander on the sweetly sleeping Little Chick.", "\u2018This guy\u2026.\u2019", "He understood that it had to sleep a lot since it was still a baby, but he suddenly found it an eyesore.", "\u201cHow can you even sleep, huh?\u201d", "When he grumpily spoke while prodding its body, Little Chick shot open its eyes and swung its head around.", "\u201cYour homeland is on the verge of destruction. Yet you can still sleep so soundly.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "Little Chick glared back at Seol Jihu without blinking before it suddenly sighed and opened its beak.", "\u201cI understand how you\u2019re feeling, but don\u2019t say things like that. I\u2019m worried too.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. It\u2019s where I was born and raised. Why wouldn\u2019t I be worried?\u201d", "\u201cThen tell me what we should do if you\u2019re that worried. We have to be able to cross over to the Spirit Realm to even do anything, you know.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to but\u2026 I really don\u2019t know. Not only has it been ages since I left the place, but I\u2019ve also never been interested in anything besides my mission. I would have told you if I knew anything.\u201d", "Little Chick chirped in a depressed voice.", "It was right. It didn\u2019t have any reason to hide anything and would have told him if it knew.", "Seol Jihu complained in a quiet voice.", "\u201cDamn it. Did the Spirit Realm not fight back? Doesn\u2019t it have a king? Then why did it fall to such straits\u2026\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. Do you really think they did nothing when invaders trespassed into their own territory?\u201d", "\u201cThen?\u201d", "\u201cThere is a \u2018Spirit King\u2019, but it\u2019s ultimately a mortal being born of the power of a god.\u201d", "Little Chick explained.", "\u201cIn the eyes of a god, humanity and Spirits are the same. It\u2019s hard for mortal beings to contest when an immortal being goes all out against them. You should know how difficult it is from just looking at your situation.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWell, don\u2019t cling onto things that aren\u2019t working out and try to look for another solution. The Sky Fairies are a race that has accompanied the Spirits since they were born. There should be a good reason why that race has given up.\u201d", "Seol Jihu hung his head at Little Chick\u2019s logical explanation.", "He had been having similar thoughts in the first place. His heart urged him to not give up while his brain yelled at him that it couldn\u2019t be helped.", "\u201cAnd don\u2019t wake me up when I\u2019m sleeping. Do you think I\u2019m sleeping because I\u2019m bored? I have my reasons for sleeping. I\u2019m trying my hardest to digest the divine power as it is\u2026\u201d", "\u201cOh really? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you know. Anyways, I\u2019m sleeping.\u201d", "\u201cAlright. Then I should\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu froze as he was raising his head. He finally felt that something was out of place.", "\u2018\u2026Huh?\u2019", "Who had he been talking to?", "Seol Jihu murmured to himself and looked down. He saw Little Chick stretch its tiny beak wide open to yawn.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cYou\u2014!?\u201d", "Little Chick let out a shriek when Seol Jihu\u2019s hands suddenly clasped around it.", "\u201cPyak!?\u201d", "\u201cYou talked, right? You talked! It was you that talked just now, right?\u201d", "\u201cPyak? Pyak?\u201d", "\u201cRight. Now that I think about it, you talked before when you were an egg too! Right? Right?\u201d", "\u201cDamn it! What are you doing!? Don\u2019t shake me! I\u2019m getting dizzy!\u201d", "\u201cI knew it!\u201d", "Seol Jihu shouted while shaking his hands. Little Chick angrily cried out, trying to twist away from his grasp.", "That night, strange chirping noises sounded out from Seol Jihu\u2019s office.", "*", "The next morning.", "Seol Jihu climbed up the stairs with Little Chick resting on top of his head. He planned to eat while thinking about whether to continue the meaningless search for the spring or to focus on raising their military force in preparations for the upcoming war.", "\u201cOh, you came?\u201d", "But someone was already there before him although it was quite early in the morning.", "Phi Sora was sitting at a table eating breakfast. She smacked her lips after sucking her chopsticks clean.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see your face nowadays. Why are you so busy?\u201d", "\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d", "\u201cIs it because of the Federation?\u201d", "\u201cI guess so. I need to find a solution but\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied with a sigh and walked towards the kitchen after placing down Little Chick on the table across Phi Sora.", "\u201cWell\u2026 Good luck.\u201d", "Shrugging her shoulders, Phi Sora stuffed the rest of the contents of her bowl into her mouth, causing her cheeks to bulge.", "At that moment.", "\u201cOh right, you eating?\u201d", "Phi Sora stopped her motions when she heard his voice from the kitchen. For the record, there was nobody in the cafeteria besides the two of them. Consequently, it really was no wonder that Phi Sora thought he was talking to her.", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "As Phi Sora stopped chewing and indifferently glanced sideways at the kitchen after hearing the sudden informal speech\u2026", "\u201cThat\u2019s right, Partner.\u201d", "\u2026She suddenly heard a new voice out of nowhere. It was a very adorable and lovely voice that sounded like the chirp of a lark.", "\u201cHow much?\u201d", "\u201cHmm. A large meal if you will.\u201d", "Little Chick spoke in a serious, almost cocky tone.", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora stopped paying attention to the food in her mouth. Her widened eyes and frowning face made it obvious that she was doubting her eyes and ears. She was so surprised that words failed her, causing her to only stare at Little Chick in disbelief.", "Feeling her gaze, Little Chick stared back. Then, it spoke.", "\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you looking at, huh?\u201d", "\u201cI-It\u2019s talking?\u201d", "\u201cWhat, did you help me talk or something?\u201d", "Phi Sora choked and started to pound her chest while coughing.", "\u201cIt\u2019s because it evolved. I fed it some divine power at the temple not too long ago, so now it can talk.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s voice came from the kitchen. After Phi Sora barely managed to swallow, she rapidly blinked her narrowed eyes before speaking.", "\u201cAh. You mentioned it was a Spirit\u2026 You\u2019re right. I thought something changed about it. There are three feathers on its head\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a loud one.\u201d", "Little Chick cut off her words.", "\u201cWhy do you talk so much? So noisy.\u201d", "\u201cOh my.\u201d", "\u201c\u2018Oh my\u2019, yourself. Did you help me grow more feathers or something?\u201d", "\u201cOh my, my, my, my? Look at this thing talk. You. Why are you so cocky?\u201d", "\u201cHmph. Ugly.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s eyes instantly blazed with fire. There was no way that she, who was very proud of her beauty, would ignore what it just said.", "\u201cYou little!\u201d", "But Little Chick didn\u2019t back down. It spread its wings intimidatingly.", "\u201cJust you wait! The day I regain my strength, you\u2019re second on the list for purging. The first is that primitive blackie.\u201d", "Little Chick spat out those words while grinding its teeth.", "\u201cDamn it. Do these little hotshots think they can mess with me? Screw this! I need to hurry up and regain my powers. I\u2019ll first grind down that ignorant, brown sugar-lump of a bastard and swallow him whole\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing as Little Chick ranted on.", "\u201cYou teeny weeny little thing. What, huh? What are you going to do?\u201d", "\u201cOh? You wanna go? You wanna go right now?\u201d", "It bounced on its tiptoes while throwing jabs in the air. The ends of its wings clenched and unclenched.", "\u201c\u2026Hah.\u201d", "Phi Sora blankly stared at it for a while before letting out an empty laugh.", "\u201cI just came here to eat breakfast, but now. Now I\u2019ve seen it all.\u201d", "\u201cMuimuimuimui~\u201d", "\u201cWow. Cheeky, aren\u2019t you? This thing is just like its master\u2026\u201d", "Tak! Phi Sora slammed down her spoon and roughly pushed back her chair to stand up. She glared at Little Chick that was provokingly mouthing things with its beak before taking her plates and walking away with big strides.", "Meanwhile, Seol Jihu was still cooking in the kitchen.", "\u201cDear! Where did that thing come from? Was it not taught any manners?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m curious too. Did Miss Phi Sora do something to it?\u201d", "\u201cOf course not! I\u2019ve only played a few pranks while it was sleeping because it was too cute. I\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s probably it. It really doesn\u2019t like anyone waking it up when it\u2019s sleeping. Since you\u2019ve even toyed with it\u2026 Just how many times did you do it to make it behave like that?\u201d", "Seol Jihu calmly asked while flipping the egg he was frying.", "Phi Sora began to think while looking up. One, two, three, four\u2026 She stopped counting after ten. Feeling guilty, she cleared her throat and changed the subject.", "\u201cOh right. Speaking of which, I heard you bought out the VIP store.\u201d", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cDo you have anything you can sell me? I\u2019m not asking you to give anything for free. Well, I\u2019d appreciate it if you gave me a member discount, though.\u201d", "\u201cAnything I can sell\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "He had given the Miyal\u2019s Branding Iron to Eun Yuri, passed on Moirai\u2019s Souvenir to Seo Yuhui, and needed to hold onto the Seed of the World Tree and Aphriso\u2019s Sedge.", "\u2018The only thing I have left is the Pneuma\u2019s Sky Boots and\u2026?\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s thoughts froze at that moment. A sudden memory had flashed past his mind. To be more precise, it was an item description that he had skimmed through in the Neutral Zone.", "\u201cDear?\u201d", "Phi Sora looked at Seol Jihu, who had suddenly frozen with an odd gaze.", "\u201c\u2026Miss Phi Sora.\u201d", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "Seol Jihu thanked her all of a sudden before letting go of the frying pan he was holding. He then turned his body and dashed out of the kitchen.", "\u201cUh uh, the egg is burning, you know!?\u201d", "\u201cWhat about my food?\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s yell was followed by Little Chick\u2019s shout.", "However, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t stop. He flew down the flight of stairs before kicking open the door to his office and crazily searching through the bag he had carefully placed in the corner.", "\u2018There definitely was\u2026\u2019", "He took out a crescent-shaped rock. It was one of the items he had earned from the Neutral Zone.", "He calmed his beating heart before activating his General Observation.", "[Saintes Mesures of Sidus]", "A piece of the divine sextant belonging to Sidus, the god of stars. Though only once, it can analyze the stars revolving in space and tell which path a constellation should take.However, the user will not know which path to take, nor will he know whether the timing or the process is right or wrong.", "Seol Jihu carefully read the description again and again.", "The reason he hadn\u2019t been immediately reminded of the Saintes Mesures of Sidus was because the description had been too difficult to understand.", "In other words, he had been unsure. There was no guarantee that it would tell him how to get to the Spirit Realm. Even if for some remote chance that it did, he couldn\u2019t be sure if the path was correct.", "However, he had nothing else left.", "Seol Jihu grasped the Saintes Mesures of Sidus in his hand with a desperate heart. He then carefully let his mana flow into it.", "Woong!", "A loud noise rang out, followed by violent tremors in his hand.However, the convulsions only lasted for a moment. The rock started to emit a bluish light and began pulling Seol Jihu in a certain direction. It felt as if a soft hand was pulling on his hand, urging him to hurry and follow it.", "\u2018Uh, uh\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu was led by the Saintes Mesures of Sidus, down the stairs to the entrance, away from the building and towards the city, and finally past the city and onto the main road.", "Unexpectedly, at the end of the road was the Eva Royal Palace.", "Seol Jihu swallowed his surprise as the Saintes Mesures of Sidus began to lead him toward the royal grounds.", "None of the soldiers barred his entry despite giving him a few glances. Instead, they courteously nodded at him. While Seol Jihu\u2019s status played a part, it was more because Charlotte Aria had strictly commanded them to absolutely not hinder his visits.", "Thanks to that, Seol Jihu was able to enter without any problems.", "And a few moments later.", "\u2018Where is it taking me?\u2019", "Seol Jihu felt the pulling sensation gradually weaken as he passed the barracks and walked on. At the same time as the sensation completely vanished, the Saintes Mesures of Sidus scattered away into a handful of ash.", "He stopped his steps. After closing and opening his hand a few times, Seol Jihu slowly raised his head.", "His eyes immediately widened when he saw the building in front of him. It was a place he had visited once before. It was a place that was far away from the palace.", "\u2018This is\u2026.\u2019", "In front of him stood a dreary, worn-down building that made anyone looking at it feel depressed.", "It was the prison within the grounds of the Eva Royal Palace."]}
