Choice of Destiny (3)", "content": ["Although Kim Hannah told Seol Jihu not to involve himself in the matter, Seol Jihu forgot about White Rose after a while.", "This was because his days were repetitions of morning arriving when he opened his eyes and the sun setting when he had the time to take a breather.", "Just like Teresa said, Dylan\u2019s sudden death made the transition of duties and responsibilities incomplete. Although Seol Jihu did his best to learn, it felt like he was banging his head against bare land.", "It was to the point that the world began to spin like he repeatedly banged his head dozens of times. He couldn\u2019t help but groan even if he tried not to.", "If Jang Maldong weren\u2019t there to teach him what to do, he would have been completely lost.", "Recently, as Carpe Diem had the need to officially announce that a new leader had been chosen, Seol Jihu had been visiting every organization that they had originally been in a good relationship with.", "Although he could send a messenger or let them know via the communication crystal, this could only be done with certain organizations.", "For example, Sicilia, the most influential organization in Haramark and the so-called Conqueror of the Southern Region, was one organization that Seol Jihu had to visit in person.", "\u201cHow intriguing.\u201d", "A relaxed voice mixed with nasal sound rang out.", "\u201cIt feels like it was just yesterday that I saw you in the Neutral Zone\u2026. To think that the little kid who followed Agnes around would stand in front of me a year later as the leader of a renowned team. This brings back old memories.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled awkwardly. When he was meeting eye to eye with this uniformed, red-haired woman who had her slightly-tilted head resting on her clenched fist, his skin broke out into goosebumps mysteriously.", "Her languid, blood-colored pupils reminded him of the beast that sat proudly atop a rock during the safari bus tour he went on when he was a kid.", "If he turned away for just a moment, he felt like she would aim for the back of his neck in an instant. Although he was slightly intimidated, he still managed to open his mouth.", "\u201cThank you, Don Cinzia.\u201d", "\u201cDon, you say.\u201d", "A smirk escaped her mouth.", "\u201cI\u2019d rather you not call me that. Don is a way to address one\u2019s elder out of respect.\u201d", "Cinzia raised her hands and continued.", "\u201cI\u2019m neither a nobleman nor a godfather who made great achievements. More importantly, I only passed the 30-year-old mark recently. Calling me Don. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too much? Agnes.\u201d", "When she slightly tilted her head and asked, Agnes who was standing next to the desk nodded her head without a word.", "\u201cIt looks like Agnes agrees too.\u201d", "\u201cMy apologies then.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize. I know you meant it out of respect. Anyways\u2014\u201d", "Cinzia chuckled before turning her gaze back to the young man.", "\u201cI heard Carpe Diem\u2019s new leader shared friendship with the Triads.\u201d", "She dealt a quick blow while his guard was down. Considering Sicilia and the Triads\u2019 relationship from a few years back, this comment couldn\u2019t be taken lightly, and Seol Jihu\u2019s facial muscles stiffened.", "\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. Don\u2019t get too ahead of yourself.\u201d", "Cinzia shook her hand as if she found the matter a bother.", "\u201cWe had a meeting with the Triads a few days ago. Hao Win personally came to visit us.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cForgetting the past and deciding to see the future\u2026. He sure knew how to talk. At first, I doubted my ears. It was surprising enough that people who found sustenance by acting proud would personally visit an enemy. I sure didn\u2019t expect them to say something so groveling.\u201d", "Cinzia shrugged her shoulders and took out a cigar from her coat that was wrapped in a sheaf of luxury tobacco leaves. Then, with a familiar motion, Agnes lit it for her.", "\u201cIn a way, we\u2019re looking forward to it. Choosing to reconcile with us must have been a big decision for them. It should be right to say that the internal conflict they\u2019ve been suffering from for years is gone.\u201d", "Cinzia added, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d then took the cigar out of her mouth.", "A turbid smoke mixed with the sound of breathing came out.", "\u201cHere\u2019s the main point. If the Triads really meant what they said, then their method of making a profit shouldn\u2019t conflict with ours. They have a reserve force, too. Since we entered Paradise and have been given the same duty, Sicilia is willing to cheer for them if they won\u2019t go against us. You understand all that?\u201d", "Method of making a profit not conflicting? While both crowding Haramark? And Sicilia was willing to \u2018cheer\u2019 for them?", "It sounded like she was hinting that she would silently watch their move. In any case, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t dig deeper. He simply nodded his head.", "\u201cSo.\u201d", "Cinzia made a satisfied smile.", "\u201cWho do you like more?\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked.", "\u201cLike I said, do you like Hao Win or\u2014\u201d", "Cinzia dragged out her speech and glanced at Agnes who was standing next to her.", "\u201cDo you like Agnes?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Was Seol Jihu wrong for hearing, \u2018Who do you like better? Mom or Dad?\u2019", "He wanted to tell her not to joke around, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel burdened by her expectant gaze.", "\u201cDo I have to answer?\u201d", "\u201cYep, I have to know the answer.\u201d", "\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Isn\u2019t it better than asking something immature like which side you prefer?\u201d", "Seol Jihu thought her original question was more immature and also noticed a hint of mischievousness in her voice. However, he decided to bury his true feelings in his heart.", "After all, it was true that the way she put it was easier to answer than choosing between Sicilia and the Triads.", "Thus, after thinking about it for a moment, the young man pointed at the attractive maid hesitantly.", "\u201cI like\u2026 Miss Agnes\u2026 a bit more\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cKeuk!\u201d", "Cinzia dropped her head.", "\u201cYou hear that, Agnes?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cCongratulations. Looks like your grooming is working out. Aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d", "\u201cNot at all.\u201d", "Agnes replied without the slightest change in her expression. She then saw Seol Jihu\u2019s blank gaze and turned her head slightly to the side.", "Perhaps Seol Jihu was mistaken or perhaps it was just the sunlight shining through the window, but her neck seemed slightly flushed.", "\u201cAhahaha, ahahaha!\u201d", "Cinzia cackled as she watched Agnes looking out to a far distance. She was laughing so hard that she even choked on the smoke and coughed.", "After barely managing to regain her composure, Cinzia stole a glance and spoke.", "\u201cSorry for putting you in a tough spot. As a comrade who has been with Agnes for a long time, it\u2019s rare to see this side of Agnes.\u201d", "\u2018Is it?\u2019", "To Seol Jihu, getting this reaction out of Agnes wasn\u2019t such a difficult thing to do. The only caveat was that he would have to prepare himself for getting beaten to a pulp.", "\u201cHuu. Thanks, I haven\u2019t laughed this hard in months. Now let\u2019s see. Since I can\u2019t let you go home empty handed\u2026.\u201d", "Cinzia asked as she rubbed her eyes.", "\u201cAre you contracted with any information agency?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cI thought not. Dylan had his own contacts, but\u2026.\u201d", "Cinzia opened her drawer.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a present. Take it.\u201d", "Then she flicked her hand lightly. Seol Jihu reflexively snatched up the object that flew toward him and saw that it was a hexagonal badge with the letter \u2018S\u2019 inscribed on it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Just an insignia symbolizing Sicilia.

It might be a bit hard to find because it\u2019s tucked away in a corner, but I\u2019m sure you can deal with that. It\u2019s a dangerous area, but if the rumors of your abilities are true, there should be nothing to worry about.\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked as he fiddled with the badge.", "\u201cI have to show this to the information agency?\u201d", "\u201cYep. They\u2019re called the Indian Assassins. The one in Haramark is only their branch, but they should be good enough.

Say hello to the old man for us. Agnes will be returning the visit soon.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. No matter where he went, they would use the expression \u2018returning the visit\u2019.

I\u2019ll take my leave then.\u201d", "Curious about Cinzia\u2019s Status, he had activated Nine Eyes. However, he couldn\u2019t see her Status Window.", "She was colorless as well. She was the second person after Seo Yuhui, on whom the General Observation didn\u2019t work.", "After leaving Sicilia, Seol Jihu headed to the southwest alleyway right away. Although he felt several suspicious gazes while searching for the right place, the gazes vanished as soon as he took out his badge.", "Seol Jihu found the assassins\u2019 hideout after a little bit of trouble, and a man wearing a turban saw the guest and greeted him with more respect than necessary.", "Although visitors were normally divided into different grades, the man offered Seol Jihu the second-highest grade\u2014 the VIP-grade\u2014 without even asking who he was.", "Seol Jihu had to pay a sizable amount of silver coins every month for their information, but he signed a 3-month-long contract on the spot.", "**", "Like the saying, \u2018time heals all wounds\u2019, people got used to unfamiliar things. After all, humans were animals capable of adapting to change.", "Taking care of urgent matters one by one as a leader, Seol Jihu finally got accustomed to wearing clothes that did not fit him.", "When he opened his eyes in the morning, he no longer worried, thinking \u2018Will I be okay today?\u2019 At the very least, he had the leisure to enjoy a cup of coffee.", "As he was sitting on the couch enjoying the scent of coffee, the sound of a door bursting open rang out.", "\u201cOh?\u201d", "Chohong appeared with water dripping off her. Judging by the wet towel around her shoulders, she must have taken a shower after her morning exercise.", "Seol Jihu retracted his gaze out of courtesy. He wasn\u2019t all too surprised. Chohong and Hugo walking around naked was a common sight by now. He would be a fool for making a fuss of it.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to wear your underwear at the very least?\u201d", "Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to say something either.", "\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d", "Chohong retorted half-heartedly. Then, rather than putting on her underwear, she picked up her Dolphin shorts without completely wiping off the water. She spoke as she calmly put one leg in and pulled up the shorts.", "\u201cNow that I think about it, you\u2019re finally around in the morning.\u201d", "\u201cYou saw me yesterday as well.\u201d", "\u201cBefore, I mean. It was hard to see your face.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, all thanks to two people leaving everything to me. I would\u2019ve been grateful if they helped just a little.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu muttered curtly, Chohong smirked.", "\u201cWho told you to be the leader?\u201d", "\u201cYou call this being a leader? Slave is more like it.\u201d", "\u201cTeam members have the responsibility of not interfering with the duties and responsibilities of a leader. In exchange, we\u2019re listening to your orders, aren\u2019t we?\u201d", "\u201cFine. Here\u2019s an order. Help me work faithfully.\u201d", "\u201cWe also have the right to reject absurd orders.\u201d", "Chohong spoke shamelessly, her shoulders bouncing up and down in joy.", "\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I at least hear you out for trivial things like this, don\u2019t I?\u201d", "Chohong smacked her Dolphin shorts.

Sit.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cCome sit.\u201d", "Tapping on his thighs, Seol Jihu\u2019s high-handed attitude made Chohong doubt her eyes.", "\u201cSon of a bitch, you finally went insane\u2026.?\u201d", "However, she suddenly put on a surprised face before giving a meaningful smile. Next, she walked toward Seol Jihu without a word, turned around, then placed her butt on his thighs as he ordered. She even slightly leaned against him.", "When her white, muscle-toned back got near, Seol Jihu was taken aback.", "\u201cCho, Chohong? What are you doing?\u201d", "\u201cWhat? I\u2019m doing what you told me to do.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m just following your order.\u201d", "As if to say, \u2018Do what you want\u2019, Chohong entrusted the weight of her body to him. Her expression that seemed to say \u2018You think you\u2019ve got the balls to do something?\u2019 was an added bonus.", "Seol Jihu put down his coffee mug and tried to push her away, in vain.", "This was because Chohong had suddenly turned around, grabbed his shoulders, and wrapped her legs around his sides.", "\u201cOoh~ So cute. What movie did you learn that line from, hm?\u201d", "\u201cG-Get off. You\u2019re acting weird.\u201d", "\u201cWhat am I going to do about this virgin boy?

What? Want me to devour you?
