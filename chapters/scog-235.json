It\u2019s best to limit information as much as possible until we meet him. He\u2019s a sly one, that guy.\u201d", "Considering that this was coming from Kim Hannah, Seol Jihu immediately had a high opinion of him.", "\u201cAnyway, this is a good opportunity for us to recruit a Priest\u2026 Do you have anyone in mind?\u201d", "Someone immediately popped into his head.", "\u201cMiss Maria.\u201d", "\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that. Wait then. Let\u2019s cast a net before we go to Eva.\u201d", "\u2018A net?\u2019", "Kim Hannah disappeared into her room once again.", "This time, Seol Jihu followed her.", "When he entered, he saw Kim Hannah trying to call someone with a communication crystal she took out from her handbag.", "Soon, a light flashed.", "\u2014Oh? Now, who is this!?", "Maria\u2019s chattering voice burst out.", "\u2014The bitch who got chased out of Sinyoung like a defeated dog!?", "\u201cYou wanna die?\u201d", "When Kim Hannah growled fiercely, Maria paused.", "\u2014Sorry\u2026", "\u201cNever mind.\u201d", "Kim Hannah glared at the crystal and spoke in a bored tone.", "\u201cRun over to Carpe Diem\u2019s office, pronto.\u201d", "\u2014What? Is that where you are now, Unni?", "\u201cI\u2019ll give you 10 minutes.\u201d", "Kim Hannah hung up after delivering a very one-sided message.", "Was Seol Jihu mistaken in thinking he heard a loud \u2018Fuck!\u2019 before the call ended?", "*", "After summoning Maria\u2026", "\u201cDo you want to enter our team?\u201d", "Kim Hannah cut straight to the chase before Maria could even sit.", "Maria, whose butt was just about to touch the couch, paused awkwardly. She didn\u2019t say anything out loud, but her face was quite clearly saying, \u2018What kind of dogshit bullcrap are you spouting?\u2019", "\u201cRelax your face, hun.\u201d", "Maria instantly fixed her expression at Kim Hannah\u2019s warning, but she still maintained a suspicious look.", "\u201cWhat are you saying out of the blue? It\u2019s the middle of the day and you\u2019re already drunk, Unni? Is it because you needed alcohol to wallow in your sorrows?\u201d", "\u201cMy mind is crystal clear, so just answer my question.\u201d", "\u201cUhm, can you at least explain the situation\u2026\u201d", "\u201cCarpe Diem is going to move to Eva soon to become an organization. We want a Priest. There, end of explanation.\u201d", "Kim Hannah fired out word after word before resting her chin on the back of her hand.", "\u201cYour answer is?\u201d", "\u201cOrganizatioooon? Carpe Diem is leaving Haramark?\u201d", "Maria reacted a moment later with a completely gobsmacked face.", "Soon, she nodded her head reluctantly.", "\u201cTrue\u2026 Carpe Diem does have many High Rankers and a ton of money\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t call you over to hear your comments. If I ask you again, you know it will be the third time, right?\u201d", "Maria let out a shrill Hiiik! before shrinking back.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 please spare me\u2026 anything but my money\u2026.\u201d", "She even began to rub her hands together and plead.", "Just what had happened between them for Maria to shake like a mouse in front of a cat? Especially when not even Agnes fazed Maria\u2019s spirit!", "While Seol Jihu was wondering, Maria barely managed to snap out of her terror. Twirling a strand of her hair with her index finger, she mumbled quietly.", "\u201cYou already know, Unni. I don\u2019t like being affiliated with a group. Plus\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI know, I know. Just say yes or no.\u201d", "Maria glanced at Seol Jihu before answering.", "\u201c\u2026No.\u201d", "\u201cOkay, we understand. You can go now.\u201d", "Kim Hannah shooed Maria away as if she was being annoying.", "Maria\u2019s eyes widened. Judging from her expression, she seemed to be thinking, \u2018She\u2019s letting me go this easily?\u2019", "\u201cI-I can go? Really?\u201d", "\u201cJeez, do you think I\u2019m going to butcher you or something?\u201d", "\u201cFuck, if you have any conscience, you shouldn\u2019t say\u2026 o-okay. I\u2019ll leave. I\u2019ll leave, alright?\u201d", "Maria hastily got up from the couch.", "\u201cIf you want, I can introduce someone to you.\u201d", "\u201cNo thanks. Recruiting someone you recommend will only end up biting us in the ass. It\u2019s fine, so close the door behind you as you leave.\u201d", "Maria stole furtive glances at Kim Hannah while darting out of the office.", "As the door half-closed behind her\u2026", "\u201cAh, Jihu.\u201d", "Kim Hannah suddenly spoke.", "\u201cThe expedition that you recently went on. I need to ask you something about the inheritance of the ghost inside the pendant.\u201d", "\u201cThe Rothschear House\u2019s inheritance?\u201d", "\u201cYeah. You said there are a few more of them, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu readily acknowledged it.", "\u201cYeah, we found the Rothschear\u2019s secret techniques last time. Including the offerings, account book, fortune, and place that Flone wasn\u2019t sure about, there are four left.\u201d", "\u201cOh~ They\u2019re separated by category?\u201d", "Kim Hannah exclaimed with a slightly loud voice.", "\u201cSo you\u2019re saying the inheritance you got this time is only the tip of the iceberg?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu gave Kim Hannah a strange look. Why was she asking him all these questions all of a sudden?", "\u2018Ah.\u2019", "Looking back at the front door just in case, Seol Jihu was immediately taken aback.", "The door wasn\u2019t fully closed. It looked like it was, but upon closer inspection, it was still open by a small gap.", "Rough breathing that could be heard behind it was the cherry on top.", "It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out who was behind the door, especially with a few strands of blonde hair peeking out.", "\u201cIya~ Just hearing it makes me itch with anticipation. For our next expedition, we should definitely go to the site with Rothschear\u2019s fortune. We\u2019re in need of money to build this organization, anyway\u2026 Ah, where is this chilly air coming from? Why is it cold all of a sudden?\u201d", "With that, Kim Hannah raised her right hand and held up the index, middle, and ring fingers.", "3, 2, 1\u2026 she began to fold them one by one as if to count down.", "The moment her last finger went down\u2026", "Tatatata!", "Small footsteps rang out, imitating the sound of someone climbing up the stairs, and then the door burst open.", "Seol Jihu could clearly see at that moment \u2014 Kim Hannah snorting before looking back with a \u2018surprised\u2019 face.", "\u201cWhat? Why are you back?\u201d", "Kim Hannah asked nonchalantly.", "\u201cHaa\u2026 haa\u2026 I left something here by mistake.\u201d", "Maria collected her breath while panting.", "\u201cYou left something? What exactly?\u201d", "\u201cUh\u2026 right\u2026 w-what was it again?\u201d", "Looking left and right with a serious expression, she paced around the room meaninglessly.", "\u201cWhat was it again? I think I dropped it somewhere around here\u2026\u201d", "She scrunched her long slender eyebrows, kneeled down, and began to look more carefully.", "\u201cJust tell me. If it isn\u2019t important, just go. I\u2019ll look for it later.\u201d", "\u201cI could never. It\u2019s super expensive.\u201d", "She didn\u2019t even remember what she lost but said it was expensive.", "Seol Jihu, who was staring at Maria with a dumbfounded expression, cleared his throat seeing Kim Hannah gesture at him with her chin.", "She was signaling him to keep talking.", "\u201cYeah, I agree. The account book is buried in the Empire, so we can\u2019t get our hands on it, but the fortune is\u2014\u201d", "\u201cHey, hey!\u201d", "Kim Hannah freaked out and cut him off.", "\u201cAre you mad? Why would you say that here?\u201d", "\u2018You\u2019re the one who made me.\u2019", "Seol Jihu chuckled inwardly.", "Suddenly curious, he looked back at Maria. As expected, she had stopped searching for her nonexistent belonging and was straining her ears, obviously trying to listen in.", "Soon, she stealthily turned her head sideways and made a devious face.", "\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d", "Kim Hannah shooed her away.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing an outsider should know.\u201d", "\u201cAii, outsider?\u201d", "Maria crawled toward them before squeezing herself in between Kim Hannah and Seol Jihu. Looking back and forth between the two, she babbled on.", "\u201cUnni, Oppa, are you going to leave me out like this? Are you really going to make me sad?\u201d", "\u201cScrew off.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t be like that~ Don\u2019t you know that I\u2019m practically a part-time member of this team? What is it~ What expedition are you talking about~\u201d", "With Maria asking so persistently, Kim Hannah slicked back her bangs and sighed.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We have no way of being sure whether it\u2019s really there. And even if it is, the available loot probably won\u2019t even reach a quarter of the Pagoda of Dreams\u2019 result.\u201d", "One of Maria\u2019s eyebrows perked up. Suspicion was plastered all over her face.", "It was then.", "[No!]", "Flone suddenly shot out of Seol Jihu\u2019s pendant.", "\u201cFwucuwckck!\u201d", "The startled Maria fumbled down while squealing like a pig. But Flone completely ignored her plight and shouted.", "[We told you it was there! You might not know because you didn\u2019t go, but other people saw it!]", "Hearing this voice, Kim Hannah was greatly taken aback.", "\u201cMiss Flone, I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d", "She glanced at Maria and tried to stop Flone, but the latter continued.", "[And what? It probably won\u2019t even reach a quarter? That\u2019s wrong too! There\u2019s a mountain of fortune there! Are you looking down on the Empire\u2019s duke family, the Rothschears?]", "At that moment, a light flickered past Maria\u2019s eyes.", "\u201cAh\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah pressed her forehead with a frustrated groan.", "\u201c\u2026Oi.\u201d", "When she lowered her voice, Maria quickly shot up.", "Kim Hannah spoke with a chilling gaze.", "\u201cI\u2019m warning you. If you say even a peep about this expedition\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWho do you think I am!?\u201d", "Maria jumped.", "\u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Oh, uh, yeah.\u201d", "\u201cThen leave.\u201d", "\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll leave. But\u2026\u201d", "Maria stole a glance at the sulking Flone, then spoke as carefully as possible to avoid incurring Kim Hannah\u2019s wrath.", "\u201cUnni, can you include me in that expedition?\u201d", "Kim Hannah immediately glared at her.", "\u201cAre you kidding? We\u2019re preparing to register as an organization, so we have heaps of things we need to spend money on, and we\u2019re busy taking care of our own members. Why would we do that for you, an outsider?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t you need a Priest?\u201d", "\u201cWe do, but we\u2019ll only take an insider to the expedition.\u201d", "\u201cI just need to become an insider then.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Kim Hannah was certainly an expert. She didn\u2019t bite right away and scoffed instead.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say no before?\u201d", "\u201cWhen did I say no!?\u201d", "Maria surprisingly yelled.", "\u201cWhat I said was, um, to give me more time because it was so sudden. Yeah~ That\u2019s what I meant!\u201d", "She waved her hand around and delivered a passionate speech.", "A nose ring if hung on the nose, an earring if hung on the ear.", "Seol Jihu was quite impressed by Maria\u2019s skill at changing her words.", "Kim Hannah still looked annoyed. To be more precise, her face seemed to be saying, \u2018Even if it\u2019s not you, we can find ourselves a good Priest.\u2019", "\u201cSo what, you\u2019re joining?\u201d", "\u201cNo\u2014 jeez, why is everyone in such a rush?\u201d", "Maria cleared her throat.", "\u201cUm\u2026 you got a contract\u2026?\u201d", "Kim Hannah muttered, \u201cObviously,\u201d while reaching into her handbag.", "After reading the contract, Maria\u2019s face scrunched up.", "\u201cFour years? What about a three month one? Six months? Or even a year?\u201d", "\u201cThis bitch, is she out of her mind?\u201d", "Kim Hannah spat out angrily before striking down Maria\u2019s complaint.", "\u201cYou must have gone mad. We\u2019re taking you on expeditions of such scale. And here you\u2019re trying to milk us dry and then bail on us in a few months?\u201d", "\u201cBut four years is still a little too much\u2026\u201d", "\u201cShut it. Jihu never set proper conditions because he\u2019s a pushover. As long as I\u2019m here, I won\u2019t sit still and watch him piss his pants.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke flatly and held her chin up.", "\u201cA man can lead a horse to water, but can\u2019t make it drink. If you don\u2019t want to, then don\u2019t.\u201d", "Maria bit her lower lip, unable to say anything.", "She looked reluctant but still put the contract away.", "\u201cWhen are you leaving Haramark?\u201d", "\u201cSoon. We\u2019re going to Eva today to check out available land.\u201d", "That meant Carpe Diem had already passed Eva\u2019s screening process.", "Maria smacked her lips for a long time.", "\u201c\u2026Okay\u2026\u201d", "In the end, she turned around with a plainly visible internal conflict before leaving through the door.", "She seemed to have left this time for real.", "\u201cHeh.\u201d", "[Heh.]", "Kim Hannah and Flone smirked while watching the front door.", "\u2018Heh?\u2019", "He understood why Kim Hannah was smirking, but why Flone?", "Soon, the two women looked at each other and smiled.", "Kim Hannah put her palm out first.", "\u201cGood.\u201d", "[Yeaaah!]", "Clap! Flone and Kim Hannah high-fived.", "\u201cYou really know how to spice up the situation, huh. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d", "[Hmph, I may look like this now, but back when I was alive, I reigned over the noble social circle, which raged with invisible cannonballs and inaudible bullets. Don\u2019t underestimate me.]", "From the sound of it, Flone must have been intrigued by Kim Hannah\u2019s scheme and had given her a hand.", "Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "\u201cYou really think Miss Maria will fall for it?\u201d", "\u201cIf it were in the past, it wouldn\u2019t have worked in the slightest. But she just tasted a large sum of money, thanks to you. How could she not follow you?\u201d", "[Ufufufu, her mind is probably telling her \u2018no\u2019, but her body should be more honest.]", "\u201cHah! Now that\u2019s a way to put it!\u201d", "Hoho! Haha!", "Seeing the two cackling women, Seol Jihu began to feel bad for Maria.", "\u201cWe cast the net, so all we have to do now is wait. Alright, let\u2019s go to Eva. Follow me.\u201d", "Kim Hannah led the way, merrily trudging toward the front door.", "Seol Jihu hurriedly chased after her.", "\u201cHannahemon\u2026!\u201d", "\u201cAh, jeez!\u201d", "*", "Kim Hannah and Seol Jihu left by a carriage that day and arrived in Eva a few days later. Kim Hannah guided Seol Jihu skillfully as if she had been here several times before.", "Their destination was a good-looking building on Eva\u2019s main street.", "It was the headquarters of Eastern Spring Merchants, one of Eva\u2019s organizations.", "Led inside and guided to a room, they were met with a potbellied man putting on an air of importance.", "He looked at Kim Hannah and gave a coarse smile.", "\u201cIya~ You live and learn. Who knew Miss Foxy of all people would contact me fir\u2026st?\u201d", "He spoke in an arrogant tone, but blinked his eyes in confusion seeing the young man walking in along with her.", "It was the same for Seol Jihu. He carefully examined the surprised man before saying.", "\u201cAh, you\u2019re from\u2026!\u201d", "If he was remembering correctly, this man was the leader of the poachers whom the team met during their last expedition.", "The leader also recognized Seol Jihu, and his jaw dropped to the floor.", "\u201cHeuk!\u201d"]}
