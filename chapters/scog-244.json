{"cid": "244", "title": "Chapter 244. City of Anarchy (1)", "content": ["The Royal Council referred to the eight organizations that had control over Eva. It was funny to attach the word \u2018royal\u2019 when no royalty was present in the council, but it was hard to laugh knowing the truth.", "Because the decisions made by this council had actually affected the state administration on numerous occasions.", "Today, inside a secret room in Eva, the Royal Council was hard at work. With one missing, there were only seven people present, but that didn\u2019t pose much of a problem as this missing person rarely showed up unless it was for an important matter.", "The topic of today\u2019s meeting was naturally Carpe Diem\u2019s move.", "Of course, as the Royal Council reigned as a king in Eva, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to ignore Carpe Diem as a mere small-scale team. After all, no matter how high their standard was, they should be helpless against the eight organizations\u2019 numbers.", "The problem was the Triads.", "Since it was impossible for the two to be moving at the same time through pure coincidence, it could be surmised that they were working together.", "With the two tied together, the matter of the move was an entirely different story.", "\u201cThey will come.\u201d", "Someone spoke with a calm voice.", "\u201cThe Triads already completed their move.\u201d", "Someone else tacked on, tapping on the table.", "\u201cCarpe Diem is currently making their way here\u2026 Damn it, why couldn\u2019t they just set up camp in Haramark? What\u2019s there to eat here that they\u2019re making such a long journey?\u201d", "A frustrated voice rang out, and the six, no, five other people sympathized deeply. Only Park Dongchun pretended to nod while continuously reading the atmosphere.", "As the head of Dongchun Merchants, Park Dongchun was a member of the Royal Council as well. In terms of position and authority, he was one of the three \u2018Middles\u2019.", "Just like how an organization had an internal hierarchy, the Royal Council had a hierarchy as well.", "1 Strong, 3 Middles, 4 Weaks.", "In reality, there was a funny story behind how this hierarchy was established.", "The original composition was of four Middles and four Weaks. While two Middles and four Weaks were forming alliances and vying for supremacy, one of the Middles that was spectating quietly, stealthily reached out to the royal palace to advance to the sole Strong.", "By enthroning the Queen, the Strong started to exercise powerful mandates, causing the two Middles and 4 Weaks to feel threatened, reconciling and joining forces.", "After a long time of keeping each other in check, they had come to a middle ground and had chosen to divide Eva among themselves.", "Among the organizations, Dongchun Merchants\u2019 position was ambiguous. It was one of the two Middles that was spectating the others\u2019 conflict, but when they showed signs of joining hands and going against the Strong, Dongchun Merchants had maneuvered to the alliance\u2019s side.", "As a result, they were neither in a favorable nor an antagonistic relationship with any other organization.", "The point being, the eight organizations, which once quarreled like cats and dogs, perfectly divvied up Eva\u2019s interests and no longer interfered in each other\u2019s territory.", "And whenever an external influence threatened their interests, they would unite to resist it.", "\u2018We\u2019ve managed to make do until now, but now\u2026\u2019", "Although the eight organizations had small misgivings with each other, they were doing well until now when uninvited guests were approaching.", "The Triads and Carpe Diem.", "\u201cWell\u2026 Can\u2019t we be a little optimistic? Carpe Diem\u2019s Seol Jihu is an Earthling of incredible achievements. There\u2019s no guarantee that Tigol Fortress wouldn\u2019t fall again, so someone like Seol Jihu coming here shouldn\u2019t be our biggest concern\u2026\u201d", "\u201cAnd what if the Triads are coming here? This is not Earth, but Paradise. They\u2019re just dogs who are running away after losing to Sicilia\u2026\u201d", "Two people offered their hopeful thoughts.", "\u201cThis isn\u2019t such a simple matter.\u201d", "But an old man refuted in a depressed tone. This was the man who had spoken up first.", "\u201cCarpe Diem\u2019s fighting prowess is one thing, but this Seol Jihu also has very complicated connections. Starting from the Daughter of Luxuria to Elder Jang, and even if that Kim wench\u2026\u201d", "As a grave voice flowed out, Park Dongchun glanced at the man who was talking.", "\u2018Omar Garcia.\u2019", "He was the leader of the Ochoa Cartel, one of the Middle organizations. His nationality was Mexican, coming from Area 4.", "\u201cOf course, the Daughter of Luxuria is now only a symbolic figure with no combat strength, Master Jang has retired once, and that fox bitch was kicked out of her own den\u2026 But we cannot deny that they are not to be trifled with!\u201d", "He acted like a gentle businessman on the outside but was a true devil on the inside.", "His main source of income was a slave market disguised as a business. He was the key figure in ordering the capture of Federation members, sparing no means necessary to achieve his goal.", "Of course, his targets included Earthlings and Paradisians as well.", "\u201cThe Triads aren\u2019t to be underestimated either. Yes, they lost to Sicilia. But don\u2019t you all know how batshit insane that organization is?\u201d", "Park Dongchun\u2019s eyes rolled to the other side, landing on a short, stumpy man with crew-cut hair.", "\u2018Sombat La-ongmanee\u2019", "He was the leader of Royal Pattaya, another Middle-level organization. His nationality was Thai, coming from Area 5.", "La-ongmanee was an evil bastard who didn\u2019t lose out to Garcia. In his early days, he expanded his influence by loan-sharking against the already poor Paradisians. And when they would fail to pay off their debts, he would sell them as slaves or drag them into the sex trade.", "He was rumored to enjoy same-sex relations while having the cruel hobby of sexually torturing young boys. However, the truth had yet to be ascertained.", "But at the end of the day, both Garcia and La-ongmanee were indisputable sons of bitches. It was so much that Park Dongchun considered himself a saint in comparison.", "\u201cCan\u2019t we stop them from registering as organizations?\u201d", "\u201cWe already tried, but that damned Sorg K\u00fchne took the matter into his own hands\u2026\u201d", "As the discussion continued, Park Dongchun noticed everyone\u2019s gazes gather on him. La-ongmanee was glaring at him from the opposite side of the table.", "\u201cWhy did you sell them that land!?\u201d", "When their eyes met, he burst out in anger.", "\u2018This bastard\u2026\u2019", "It was obvious what La-ongmanee was trying to do. He was trying to pin the blame on someone in a fit of frustration.", "Of course, since they hadn\u2019t been affected directly, they wouldn\u2019t do anything to Park Dongchun. But in case something did happen, La-ongmanee was setting up the council\u2019s opinions to turn him into a sacrificial lamb.", "\u201cWhat did you want me to do? Seol Jihu barges into my office with that fox, demanding me to sell them a plot of land. Do you honestly think I can say no in that situation?\u201d", "Park Dongchun put on a wronged expression and protested. Dongchun Merchants was one of the three Middle-level organizations. He had the right to speak out.", "\u201cWhat you could have done? Make excuses, of course! Isn\u2019t that your specialty!?\u201d", "\u201cHah, you make it sound so easy. Fine, let\u2019s say I somehow did refuse them. You think you guys can do the same?\u201d", "\u201cYou idiot! What\u2019s forcing us to sell our land!?\u201d", "La-ongmanee burst out in rage. Park Dongchun coughed before speaking.", "\u201cThat fox already knew I had land available to sell before coming.\u201d", "\u201cJesus Christ. I bet you were blinded by money and sold it off. What are we gonna do now?\u201d", "Park Dongchun smacked his lips.", "\u201cWell, since things turned out like this\u2026 why not just wait and see what they do? We don\u2019t have any intel on their plans, after all.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "La-ongmanee, who was about to go off on another fit of anger, suddenly put on a flustered look. The other five members, excluding himself and Park Dongchun, were all nodding their heads.", "A faint smile hung on Park Dongchun\u2019s mouth.", "The fuming La-ongmanee suddenly tilted his head. The Triads could maybe be set aside since they already had a branch in Eva. But why wasn\u2019t everyone riled up about pressuring the person who cooperated with Carpe Diem?", "At that moment, the sole woman in the council snickered.", "\u201cGee, the more I think about it, you are really evil, Mister Dongchun.\u201d", "\u201cEii, it was a fair trade. Isn\u2019t it fine if everyone is happy?\u201d", "\u201cBut still! How can you think to sell that land? I almost feel bad for them.\u201d", "\u201cCome to think of it, how did you manage to sell it off? Against the infamous Miss Foxy, no less.\u201d", "Garcia also joined in on the conversation, expressing his interest. Hearing this, the dazedly staring La-ongmanee quickly opened his mouth.", "\u201cWait, wait, what\u2019s going on? I feel like I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s not following this.\u201d", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the rumors about that land?\u201d", "When the woman asked in a cheerful voice, La-ongmanee raised a question.", "\u201cIt\u2019s that cursed plot of land. You know, the one where everyone who enters, dies.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? A cursed plot of land\u2026? Oh, that place! That wasn\u2019t a rumor?\u201d", "\u201cNot at all. Over ten incidents happened there, and dozens of people have died so far. None of them managed to pass four months.\u201d", "When the woman spoke in a firm voice, La-ongmanee blinked repeatedly. It might be a coincidence the first couple of times, but starting from the third time, it couldn\u2019t be a coincidence.", "\u201cBut\u2026 they might be different\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI doubt it. Even a High Ranker Priest from the temple of Invidia was found with his stomach cut open after one month.\u201d", "\u201cOh reaaaally?\u201d", "\u201cIt was so bad that Mister Money Demon over there tried to hand it over to me! He offered me that plot of land for a cheap price. I got curious and did some research, and lo and behold, it was a no-good land.\u201d", "When the woman sent a sideways glance, Park Dongchun sneakily averted her gaze. La-ongmanee gave him a renewed look.", "\u201cYou sold it? Really?\u201d", "\u201cOf course, I sold it. What, you think I\u2019d say I sold it without selling it?\u201d", "Park Dongchun replied curtly before taking out a piece of paper and tossing it. When La-ongmanee saw the contract for the sale of the property, his eyes widened.", "\u201cIya~ You didn\u2019t even take a big loss.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t take a big loss? Do you see how many gold coins I lost out on?\u201d", "\u201cIf the rumors are true, there shouldn\u2019t have been anyone else trying to buy it, right?\u201d", "La-ongmanee chuckled and tossed the paper back.", "\u201cSo, how did you sell it? Against the fox bitch.\u201d", "\u201cAh, well~ It wasn\u2019t much~\u201d", "Park Dongchun put on airs and spoke.", "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since she left Sinyoung. How much authority could she have in Carpe Diem? It looked like she was simply seeking protection, so I focused on winning over Seol Jihu.\u201d", "\u201cWinning over?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. I just scratched his back a little, and he held his chest out. Man, you guys should have seen Miss Foxy\u2019s face~\u201d", "Park Dongchun wagged this index finger up and down, making La-ongmanee burst into laughter. Similar laughs rang out beside them.", "\u201cFuck, you scummy scoundrel! You\u2019re the scariest one out of all of us!\u201d", "La-ongmanee giggled and looked around the room. His complexion was a lot brighter than before.", "\u201cAh, you should have told me earlier! Everyone looked so depressed that I thought we were in deep shit!\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s true that they\u2019re coming here.\u201d", "That was just how human psychology worked. After hogging a jar of honey for a long time, they wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing it with someone else.", "\u201cAnyway, since there isn\u2019t anything we can immediately do, just watching them doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea\u2026 Three or four months should do.\u201d", "Park Dongchun mentioned in a suggestive tone, stealthily glancing around the room. Then, the corner of his mouth curled up. It was a sinister smirk.", "\u201c\u2026What do you guys think?\u201d", "\u201cIf it\u2019s just four months\u2026\u201d", "La-ongmanee replied without reserve and then got up. He put on his jacket and walked out of the conference room.", "\u201cThen let\u2019s go with that. We\u2019re not justified in hindering them, so we\u2019ll keep an eye on them for the moment.\u201d", "Garcia also got up. As the meeting began to adjourn, Park Dongchun inwardly smiled with satisfaction.", "*", "Same time.", "\u201cLet\u2019s see. We\u2019re almost done here\u2026 Hmm?\u201d", "A part-time worker, who was straightening his back and wiping his sweat, suddenly widened his eyes.", "Swish, swish! The broom was moving by itself, cleaning the garden.", "\u201cEeeeeeh!?\u201d", "The shocked worker rubbed his eyes and took a closer look.", "\u201c?\u201d", "And the broom was leaning against the wall as if nothing had happened.", "\u201cWhat? What happened this time?\u201d", "Having heard his scream, the worker\u2019s colleagues rushed in.", "\u201cT-That\u2026\u201d", "\u201cBroom? What about the broom?\u201d", "The worker\u2019s speech trailed off. \u201cDid I see it wrong?\u201d Murmuring to himself, he tilted his head.", "\u201cNo\u2026 I definitely saw it\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cJeez, what are you saying all of a sudden\u2026\u201d", "The worker\u2019s colleague clicked his tongue and patted his back.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, go back and rest. We\u2019re almost at the finish line, so don\u2019t jinx us.\u201d", "\u201cMmm.\u201d", "\u201cThe construction\u2019s almost over. I shouldn\u2019t say this since I\u2019m the one who built this place, but I wonder how long they\u2019ll last here\u2026\u201d", "The co-worker trudged out, leaving those words behind.", "\u2018Was I seeing things because I was tired? Maybe I should tap out for the day.\u2019", "The worker stood still for a while before trudging off. Then, he abruptly turned around.", "The broom was still in the same spot as before.", "*", "Carpe Diem arrived at Eva when dusk was on the verge of blanketing the city.", "A new city, a new road, and new people. Passing them by on the way, Seol Jihu finally arrived at their new base.", "\u2018Gee\u2026\u2019", "No matter how many times he looked at it, it never ceased to give off an imposing aura.", "In truth, he was imagining a reasonably sized modern building, but Kim Hannah had built a medieval castle in the middle of the city.", "Kim Hannah spoke proudly as she saw the teammates looking on in amazement.", "\u201cThis is Carpe Diem\u2019s new home.\u201d", "The words \u2018new home\u2019 moved Seol Jihu. Soon, everyone rushed inside. Kim Hannah quickly chased after them, handing each of them a piece of paper while saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll need it.\u201d", "Apparently, it was a map of the building.", "The magnificent, ceilingless entrance door was made of steel and stood like a Roman arch. When the team pulled this door open, the inside scenery spread out.", "A white pathway connected the entrance to the main building. A refreshing, green garden could be seen on the left, and a beautiful blue lake sat on the right, surrounded by lush trees and shrubbery.", "At the end of the pathway, two branching stairways led to the main building, while large bonsai trees were planted in the middle, giving off a delicate, clean scent.", "\u2018Wow\u2026.\u2019", "Despite being in the city\u2019s downtown area, the place was full of the scent of nature. Smelling this rich scent, Seol Jihu tilted his chin up.", "A ten-story building, was it?", "Rows of neatly arranged Roman arch windows reflected the sunset glow, giving the building an awe-inspiring magnificence.", "But the interior was even more magnificent. As soon as Seol Jihu stepped into the first floor, he thought, without a shred of exaggeration, that he was at a ballroom.", "Seeing his teammates staggering around as if they were drunk, Seol Jihu stared at the map.", "\u2018The first and second basement levels are hot springs, the first floor is the lobby\u2026\u2019", "After reaching the tenth-floor cafeteria, Seol Jihu dropped his jaw in astonishment.", "\u2018Just looking around this place is going to take a few days.\u2019", "Seol Jihu walked slowly as he studied the map.", "How much time went by?", "After scanning through the ten floors, Seol Jihu walked back down to the first floor, looking a bit tired.", "His first impression of the new home was\u2026 well, he couldn\u2019t quite put it into words. The corridors were too complicated to navigate, and there were too many rooms. It looked like the perfect place to get lost in.", "\u201cHow is it?\u201d", "As he was sitting in front of the front door stairway to cool his head, a pleasant voice rang out. Kim Hannah was walking out with a cheerful smile. Seol Jihu sighed.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. It hasn\u2019t really hit me yet.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll get used to it once you start living here.\u201d", "Kim Hannah chuckled before sitting down next to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cAnyway, we really ended up coming to Eva.\u201d", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you going to do first?\u201d", "It was a simple question, yet was full of many meanings.", "Seol Jihu fiddled with the poor egg he had in his pocket. He had a clear goal. The problem was ways and means to achieve this goal.", "To put it bluntly, if he stormed out to the streets and yelled, \u2018From today, I am Eva\u2019s King!\u2019, he would only be treated as a lunatic.", "What should he do to become Eva\u2019s representative?", "Surely, that was what Kim Hannah was asking as well.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. What do you think?\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t that Seol Jihu was completely lost, but he returned the question back to Kim Hannah. He wanted to hear her thoughts.", "Kim Hannah laughed, then spoke clearly.", "\u201cLearn.\u201d", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "\u201cSeeing it once is better than hearing it a thousand times. Come with me.\u201d", "Kim Hannah shot up like a rubber band and crossed the garden like a cat. Seol Jihu, who was staring at her fixedly, quickly chased after her.", "*", "Strolling around the downtown area, Kim Hannah suddenly asked.", "\u201cHow much do you know about Eva?\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. That it\u2019s a Priest city, I guess?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s not wrong.\u201d", "Kim Hannah nodded her head, walking ahead of him.", "\u201cDo you know this?\u201d", "\u201cKnow what?\u201d", "\u201cThat Paradise has more queens than kings.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. Kim Hannah had been saying incomprehensible things since a while ago. But it was highly unlikely that Kim Hannah was saying a bunch of nonsense. She must have had her reason for bringing these things up.", "\u201cOther than Caligo and Haramark, the other five cities are all being ruled by queens. What do you think is the reason?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Because of the war?\u201d", "\u201cCorrect.\u201d", "Kim Hannah applauded.", "\u201cThe long, drawn-out war not only lowered the population, but also affected the sex ratio. Not just for commoners, but also for nobles and royalty.\u201d", "Kim Hannah tilted her head slightly and let out a nasal hum.", "\u201cMm\u2014 At best, the ratio of men to women should be 3.5 to 6.5. And most of these men have been conscripted to the military.\u201d", "Kim Hannah turned her head and glanced at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cEva is the same.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThe current queen, Charlotte Aria, was the middle child of the three siblings. She lost her parents and younger brother to the Parasites\u2019 attack, and her sole remaining older brother died in a war against the Federation. Most of Eva\u2019s nobility also died or abandoned their titles and escaped.\u201d", "Before he noticed, Seol Jihu was enthralled by Kim Hannah\u2019s story.", "\u201cOf course, there were nobles who maintained their allegiance to the royal family until the end\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu immediately realized she was talking about Sorg K\u00fchne.", "\u201cThink about it. What would Earthlings have thought, seeing a young queen left alone as the sole ruler of such a geographically advantageous city?\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t answer. But he could guess the answer from the things he had seen and experienced until now.", "Kim Hannah hesitated slightly, but finally continued her story in a determined voice.", "\u201cTo be honest\u2026 I\u2019ve been wanting to tell you something after we came to Eva.\u201d", "She spun back and gazed at Seol Jihu fixedly. Taking a few steps back, she asked.", "\u201cHow was Haramark?\u201d", "What did this mean?", "\u201cHaramark is known as the City of Crime. But did it really feel like one?\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows before shaking his head.", "Haramark was once one of the worst be-all-end-all cities in existence. Paradisians and Earthlings opposed each other, and Earthlings took part in mudslinging fights with other Earthlings.", "But that was before Seol Jihu entered Paradise.", "After the internal strife ended, Haramark hastily stabilized the city. The royal family actively negotiated with the rebels, and Sicilia became the royal family\u2019s partner and seized control over all Earthlings. So much so that Earthlings would run away at the sight of Agnes and the Triads would be pressured to move.", "In other words, the royal family had skillfully taken control of the situation, only being possible thanks to Sicilia honoring their agreement with the royal family.", "\u201cThere is no such thing as an eternal war. A war will end. Whether that be in a constructive way or a destructive way.\u201d", "Thinking about it this way, it could be said that Haramark\u2019s internal war came to a constructive end.", "Then what about Eva?", "\u201cSo, what I want to say is\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah turned back to the front again before continuing.", "\u201cNot all royalty are as competent as Princess Teresa and King Prihi.\u201d", "Her voice even sounded cold.", "Kim Hannah suddenly came to a stop. Seol Jihu stopped subconsciously, his eyebrows going up. He finally realized.", "The surrounding people, the surrounding scenery, no\u2026", "\u201cTake a good look.\u201d", "As if everything was a lie, Seol Jihu\u2019s surroundings changed instantly.", "He didn\u2019t even feel like he walked a long distance. But\u2026", "\u201cThis scenery\u2026\u201d", "Looking around in a daze\u2026", "\u201c\u2026is the true face of the city that you\u2019re trying to become the king of.\u201d", "Seol Jihu became speechless."]}
