{"cid": "302", "title": "Chapter 302. The Prodigal Son (2)", "content": ["The Federation was made from a union of five races. This meant there was no singular king that governed the entire nation. But that did not mean it had no leaders. Each race had a designated representative, and one race undoubtedly had the greatest say in the council.", "Once Seol Jihu thought this far, he had an idea who was included in the delegation. It wasn\u2019t too difficult given which race took the lead to form the Federation.", "\u201cThe Fallen Angels.\u201d", "\u2014Yes. And among the Fallen Angels are special beings who are especially revered by the others. They\u2019re called the Four Fallen Archangels.", "Mikael suddenly crossed Seol Jihu\u2019s mind.", "\u2014And among these four\u2026", "But before Seol Jihu could ask whether it really was her, Sorg K\u00fchne continued.", "\u2014The highest-ranked Fallen Archangel is currently staying in Eva.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes rapidly widened. The Federation, the second most powerful force in Paradise, had its chief leader visiting Eva?", "This was not something he could take lightly, and given that they were at war, it could be considered a matter of great consequence.", "Looking back, there was a precedent of one of the Four Fallen Archangels visiting Haramark. But at the time, they had a grand mission of saving Seol Jihu\u2014 humanity\u2019s vital battle strength.", "But the \u2018surface\u2019 reason for their visit this time was insignificant. It was apparently to thank the Eva Royal Family for the rescue and safe return of the Federation members that were hunted as slaves.", "However, this matter wasn\u2019t something the Federation should thank the humans for, nor was it a matter that required the visit of its chief leader.", "\u2018He said they arrived four days ago?\u2019", "More than enough time had passed for them to finish saying their thanks and leave, yet the delegation was still staying in Eva. Although they need not say this publicly, they apparently had business with Seol Jihu.", "Just what happened for such high-ranking figures to personally visit?", "Seol Jihu\u2019s heart grew heavier the more he thought about it. He didn\u2019t think it would be for a good thing. He would have to hear them out to be sure, but they most certainly had a reason for staying in Eva.", "Seol Jihu tossed and turned in his bed before drifting into a light sleep. When he woke up, he could feel the cold air of the morning. After getting out of his bed and washing up, he hurriedly finished breakfast and packed his bag.", "After putting the still-drowsy Little Chick into his pocket, he left the building. Because he called Sorg K\u00fchne on his way over, the royal administrator was waiting for him. He guided Seol Jihu to a secluded room in the palace. As the door opened, Seol Jihu took a deep breath to soothe his pounding heart.", "Three people were sitting in the room. On the left was Yuirel who he was acquainted with. Once Seol Jihu entered, she raised her hand and greeted him.", "Seol Jihu had never seen the woman on the right, but judging by her white skin and pointy ears, she was sure to be a Sky Fairy.", "Finally, sitting in the middle of the two was a woman whose eyes were closed and black wings folded. Her silver-white hair flowed down like a waterfall, and she carried a lofty look. Although she wasn\u2019t Mikael, she gave off an inviolable majesty.", "Seol Jihu halted his steps. Soon, the angel\u2019s eyes opened slightly. As soon as her beautiful silver eyes, seemingly filled with moonlight, caught sight of Seol Jihu, she gave a languid smile.", "\u201cHello.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was momentarily taken aback. How should he put this\u2026 She had greeted him in a much friendlier manner than he expected. He wasn\u2019t expecting her to say in a grand manner, \u2018Come, human\u2014\u2019, but the image of angels within him shattered like glass.", "But not caring about Seol Jihu\u2019s idle thoughts, the Fallen Angel was already busy studying Seol Jihu right and left. She spoke once again only after staring at him with a profound gaze for quite some time.", "\u201cI see. So you are the fate that the Parasite Queen fears\u2026\u201d", "Then, she tilted her head.", "\u201cHow very interesting. A fate that dies once does not reopen easily. It isn\u2019t as if there is no precedent\u2026 but even the Martial God needed forced intervention to twist it open, yet to do it with one\u2019s own strength\u2026 Hmm, this doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cAh, don\u2019t mind it. I was just talking to myself.\u201d", "The Fallen Angel chuckled while waving her hand dismissively. She then crossed her arms and shrugged.", "\u201cI\u2019m Gabriel.\u201d", "\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Valhalla\u2019s representative, Seol Jihu.\u201d", "\u201cI know. Anyone from the Federation would unless they were living under a rock.\u201d", "Gabriel smiled.", "\u201cWell, please excuse me for only revealing my name. After I\u2019ve fallen, things like ranks and positions have long since become meaningless.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say anything. Not only was this the first time he was meeting her, but he also didn\u2019t understand a thing she was saying.", "It didn\u2019t look like Gabriel really minded either. She simply gestured at him to take a seat.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this right after meeting you, but can we ask you to do us a favor?\u201d", "Gabriel cut to the chase as soon as Seol Jihu sat down.", "\u201cWe thought we\u2019d be able to meet you the day we got here, but things have gotten delayed more than we\u2019d like. We need to hurry back. The situation isn\u2019t all that good.\u201d", "\u201cYes, it\u2019s fine. Go ahead.\u201d", "\u201cThank you. First, we\u2019d like to see the Arcus Spirit. This is a very important matter for us.\u201d", "Gabriel said in a haste. Seol Jihu had already heard the reason for their visit yesterday from Sorg K\u00fchne. The first was for Gabriel to see Seol Jihu, the second was to see Little Chick, and the third was to tell him something.", "Seol Jihu took out Little Chick from his pocket.", "\u201cAh\u2014!\u201d", "After seeing the Arcus Spirit, the Sky Fairy exclaimed softly.", "Gabriel asked, \u201cIs he the real thing?\u201d", "\u201cYes! He\u2019s still in infancy, but I\u2019m certain this is the Arcus Spirit!\u201d", "The Sky Fairies had previously held a ritual at the location of the Pagoda of Dreams. The purpose of this ritual was to sense the energy of the Arcus Spirit and communicate with it.", "But one day, this energy had vanished. The Federation\u2019s higher-ups confirmed that an expedition team had entered the Pagoda of Dreams and guessed that Seol Jihu must have taken the Arcus Spirit.", "They had come to Eva to achieve the goal of that ritual.", "\u201cGood. Then hurry up and ask.\u201d", "Hearing Gabriel\u2019s command, the Sky Fairy looked at Seol Jihu. Once she nudged the sleeping Little Chick, it woke up with its eyes flashing.", "\u201cPpi?\u201d", "Just as it was about to throw a fit, as usual, the sound of wind leaked out of the Sky Fairy\u2019s mouth. It was almost as if she was whistling.", "Seol Jihu immediately thought, \u2018What is she doing?\u2019 But in the next moment, Little Chick turned its head and gazed at the whistling Sky Fairy.", "\u201cPhwwwht\u2014\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Pyak.\u201d", "\u201cPhwwwht, phwwwht\u2014\u201d", "\u201cPyak pyak?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened as the two seemed to be exchanging a conversation.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Spirit Language.\u201d", "Yuirel whispered after seeing Seol Jihu\u2019s expression.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the language Spirits use when they communicate. Sky Fairies don\u2019t really need to learn it because they\u2019re born with the ability to communicate their feelings with the Spirits, but some Fairies choose to learn it anyways. We brought a Fairy who knew how to speak Spirit Language to better communicate with the Arcus Spirit.\u201d", "Seol Jihu wanted to ask more about the language but closed his mouth after seeing the grave look on the Sky Fairy\u2019s face. For a while, only the sound of whistling and chirps rang out in the room.", "After ten minutes went by\u2026", "\u201cPyak\u2026.\u201d", "Little Chick dropped its head while crossing its tiny wings. The way it closed its eyes, it seemed to have fallen into deep thought.", "Seeing this, the Sky Fairy\u2019s expression darkened.", "\u201cHow is it?\u201d", "The Sky Fairy quietly shook her head at Gabriel\u2019s question.", "\u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t know. Apparently, it\u2019s been too long since he\u2019s left the Spirit Realm\u2026.\u201d", "Gabriel clicked her tongue.", "\u201cMaybe we were expecting too much.\u201d", "\u201cDid something happen?\u201d", "After seeing an opening, Seol Jihu finally asked what he had been curious about the most. Gabriel glanced at him, then sighed.", "\u201cIf it\u2019s you\u2026 I guess it\u2019s fine to tell you. I\u2019ll be blunt. The Spirit Realm\u2019s energy vanished.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, our communication had been cut off even before that. But even though the unstable connection made it impossible for us to summon Spirits, the Fairies could still feel that the Spirit Realm existed.\u201d", "\u201cWhat does not being able to feel the Spirit Realm\u2019s energy mean\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201d", "Gabriel said meekly.", "\u201cIt means that the foundation of the Spirit Realm\u2014 the World Tree\u2014 has withered.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s heart sank.", "[The moment the Spirit Realm falls, Tigol Fortress is done for. And if Tigol Fortress falls, it\u2019s the end for the Federation. And if the Federation falls\u2026]", "What Eun Yuri from his vision tried so hard to stop had happened.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t there a way to revive the World Tree?\u201d", "\u201cIf it was that easy, we wouldn\u2019t be here right now.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu asked in a hurry, Gabriel smacked her lips and raised three fingers.", "\u201cReviving the World Tree is extremely difficult. To do it, you need to solve three problems. Unfortunately, they\u2019re all very difficult to do.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are they?\u201d", "\u201cAs I said before, the Spirit Realm\u2019s energy vanishing means that the World Tree has died completely. So we would need to give birth to a new World Tree, and we would need the seed of the World Tree for this.\u201d", "Gabriel continued.", "\u201cBut this seed was held by the mother World Tree in the Spirit realm. I doubt the Army Commander that destroyed the World Tree left this seed untouched.\u201d", "\u201cBy the seed of the World Tree\u2014\u201d", "Seol Jihu immediately opened his bag. He wanted to ask the Federation about it anyway, and this was the perfect opportunity.", "\u201cAre you talking about this?\u201d", "As Seol Jihu pulled his hand out, a fingernail-sized seed was sitting on his palm. It looked like a persimmon seed but glowed green while giving off a mystical energy.", "The three visitors\u2019 attention fell on the seed immediately. And about five seconds later, the Sky Fairy screamed her lungs out.", "\u201cAAAAAAAH\u2014!\u201d", "She even slammed the table while shooting up and fumbled to the ground.", "\u201cThe\u2026! The seed of the World Tree!?\u201d", "She shouted while flailing on the floor. Even Yuirel stuck out her tongue and gasped.", "\u201cThis is\u2026 surprising.\u201d", "Only Gabriel maintained a relative calm.", "\u201cHow do you have this object?\u201d", "\u201cI brought it from the Neutral Zone.\u201d", "\u201cNeutral Zone?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s an area created by the Seven Gods. Special items are sold there, and the contribution points offered by Earthlings are used to materialize\u2026\u201d", "Once Seol Jihu finished his brief explanation, Gabriel frowned while Yuirel simultaneously clutched her head.", "\u201cAaaaaah! Damn it! If only you brought it earlier!\u201d", "\u201cHuh?\u201d", "\u201cJust a little! If we had it just a little earlier! Aaaaargh!\u201d", "She then banged her head on the table in intense regret. As Seol Jihu stared at her in a daze, Gabriel smiled bitterly.", "\u201cI told you, the World Tree should have died already.\u201d", "\u201cThen we just have to plant the seed and grow another one.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. We can. But do you think the World Tree can grow to adulthood in a single day?\u201d", "Seol Jihu went \u201cAh\u201d. Even an ordinary tree needed a long time to grow. He couldn\u2019t fathom how long it would take the World Tree to reach adulthood.", "\u201cThat\u2019s why I said there wasn\u2019t just one problem. Well, it would be a different story if the Parasite Queen waited until the World Tree grew.\u201d", "\u201cIs there no way we can speed up the World Tree\u2019s growth?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely impossible. The World Tree isn\u2019t a fool. It has several methods prepared in case it perishes.\u201d", "\u201cRight.\u201d", "\u201cWell, it would be more correct to say it stores a special nutrient to facilitate the growth of the next World Tree.\u201d", "Gabriel tapped on the table anxiously.", "\u201cThat nutrient is officially called Aphriso\u2019s Sedge. Given the current situation, we\u2019ll need about five of them. That\u2019s the only way to see the rate of growth we want.\u201d", "\u201cAphriso\u2019s Sedge?\u201d", "\u201cYes. To be honest, wanting five would be being too greedy. If we had just three\u2026 no, just one or two, then we\u2019d be able to have some hope\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d", "\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s a huge chance that the Army Commander would have snatched them from the dead World Tree as w\u2014\u201d", "In the next moment, Gabriel couldn\u2019t finish her sentence and dropped her jaw. It was because Seol Jihu had put his hand into his bag and took something else out.", "It wasn\u2019t only Gabriel who was surprised. Yuirel raised her head helplessly and instantly became frozen. The Sky Fairy, who was getting up in an awkward standing position, tripped on her foot and fell back down.", "\u201cThis is it, right? Aphriso\u2019s Sedge.\u201d", "In Seol Jihu\u2019s hand were tuberous roots that looked like nuts. Five of them, no less.", "A heavy silence descended in the room."]}
