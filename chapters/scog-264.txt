The result of the investigation was revealing numerous evidence of communication between Jung Sua and Omar Garcia, and there was testimony from Dongchun Merchants and Red Hwaru\u2019s representatives as well.", "As a result, Jung Sua was surrounded by enemies on all sides, and more and more members of Evangeline were leaving the organization every day.", "The problem was that Jung Sua was persevering even in such a situation.", "\u201cSorg K\u00fchne is trying to push Jung Sua to a corner by using the fact that she provided assistance for Eva Alliance\u2019s attack on Carpe Diem.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s finger tapped on her chair\u2019s armrest.", "\u201cThe problem is that there\u2019s only circumstantial evidence.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t Omar Garcia confess? You said there were testimonies too.\u201d", "\u201cBut there\u2019s no decisive piece of evidence. She should really be raising the white flag at this point, but she\u2019s struggling to the bitter end.

Eva\u2019s Queen is a pitiful person if you get to know her. If you\u2019re judging her as a human being and not a ruler, that is.\u201d", "\u201cWhat if you judge her as a ruler?\u201d", "\u201cA total failure. If someone like her can be a queen, I would do it a million times better. I still can\u2019t believe that brat shares the same blood as her father and older brother.\u201d", "Kim Hannah criticized the queen sharply. Seol Jihu suddenly grew curious.", "\u201cWhat kind of a person is Jung Sua? She\u2019s also from Area 1, right?\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s an opportunist. And to add one more thing\u2014\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes rolled.", "\u201cCome to think of it, you participated in the last Banquet, right?\u201d", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cThen you should remember role-playing.\u201d", "Role-playing. It was a term he hadn\u2019t heard of in a while.", "The burly man known as the Heaven-Slaughtering Star and the odd white-headband girl crossed his mind, but he chose to ask about them later. That wasn\u2019t his focus for now.", "\u201cJung Sua too lost in role-playing and is struggling in her own delusion. Together with her opportunistic nature, she\u2019s a weird type of hybrid that you probably haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean by role-playing?\u201d", "\u201cThe role of her predecessor.\u201d", "Kim Hannah answered right away, but Seol Jihu still looked confused.", "\u201cCan you explain in more detail?\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2014 It\u2019s a bit complicated. Where should I start\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah must have expected this response as she closed her eyes and swept down on her face.", "\u201cEvangeline was a good organization. By your standards, I mean.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cListen. You know that Evangeline\u2019s members are continually leaving the organization right now, yes?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d", "\u201cWhy do you think they\u2019re leaving? Or rather, what can you get out of this?\u201d", "Kim Hannah continued.", "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Their affection fell when the representative they thought was just and clean was actually dirty. Meaning, Jung Sua didn\u2019t share her relationship with the Eva Alliance with the rest of the organization.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re saying Jung Sua used to be an Earthling who sincerely cared for Paradise in the past? And she\u2019s changed now?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke firmly.", "\u201cI told you, Jung Sua is an opportunist who\u2019s too much into role-playing. The real one was her predecessor, Evangeline Rose.\u201d", "\u2018Evangeline Rose?\u2019", "\u201cWell, she died in the last Banquet though.\u201d", "\u2018Ah.\u2019", "It was then that Seol Jihu realized the truth. The Earthling who volunteered to enter the Plaza of Sacrifice first and was killed.

You know, like double agents. They\u2019d pretend to be on the seven organizations\u2019 side, making them put their guard down while gathering evidence to send them flying in one go.\u201d", "Kim Hannah then added, \u201cKind of like what we did.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026How do you know all this?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was surprised.", "\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me. Sinyoung\u2019s intelligence network is far wider than you think.\u201d", "Kim Hannah continued.", "\u201cAnyway, for whatever reason, she participated in the Banquet and died in Stage 2. She failed to deliver the fatal blow she worked so hard to prepare.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s when Jung Sua stepped up as the proxy leader. She smoothly swallowed the empty seat Evangeline Rose left behind and even won over the Queen. I could genuinely praise her for her hustle if she just stopped there, but\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah shook her head.", "\u201cShe used Evangeline Rose\u2019s scheme for a secret deal with the seven organizations. So really, she\u2019s just a pathetic opportunist who\u2019s desperate to maintain her position.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but this detail made Seol Jihu\u2019s interest in Evangeline Rose grow bigger.", "\u2018Kim Hannah said it was only a theory, but there\u2019s a high chance that this is the truth.\u2019", "After all, this fits perfectly with Evangeline Rose\u2019s title as the \u2018Guardian of Eva.\u2019", "But what Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t understand was why she decided to participate in the Banquet. Why would she do something so risky when the opportunity to destroy the Eva Alliance was around the corner?", "Just what wish could she have had?", "\u2018There has to be something\u2026 I can smell it\u2026\u2019", "\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll hear from Jung Sua soon.\u201d", "Kim Hannah continued.", "\u201cBefore then, let\u2019s do what we need to.

It would be even better if it sounded nice.", "Choosing a long, complicated word to make a cool name was not preferred because once registered, an organization\u2019s name could not be changed so easily.", "In a way, this was an important matter, so everyone sat down together to offer their thought.", "Chohong was the first one to speak.", "\u201cThe Strong.\u201d", "She crossed her arms and tilted her chin up.
