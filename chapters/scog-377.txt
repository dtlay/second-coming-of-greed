Seol Jihu did not restrict his senses today, and he was currently displaying extreme concentration.", "Not long afterward, a group of rocks appeared on the second peak. As they rolled down with a crashing sound, Seol Jihu stopped in place.", "He purposely closed his eyes.", "He was more used to this. Now, he even felt strange seeing with his eyes.", "As the senses picked up by Intuition drew a picture of the surroundings in his head, Seol Jihu immediately set into motion.", "The boulder soared up to the sky.

As a result, a thunderous sound resounded, and the rocks bounced in all directions.", "Seol Jihu aimed the Spear of Purity at the rocks that flew at him erratically.", "In the next instant, dozens of golden sword qi burst out from the spear blade.", "Kwang, kwang, kwang, kwang!", "The released flurry of sword qi carpet-bombed the sky. Seeing the rocks shatter, Black Seol Jihu let out a chuckle.", "It was a brute-force attack no matter how he looked at it.", "Did he shoot the sword qi knowing exactly where the rocks were? Or did he overexert his energy, thinking the flurry of sword qi would hit all targets?", "Black Seol Jihu soon judged that it was the former.", "Because amidst the vibrant explosions, the boulder that he threw into the air was coming down without a single scratch. Black Seol Jihu became absolutely positive after seeing the sword qi pushing the rocks away from the boulder.", "And so, as all the rocks rained down from the sky as tiny fragments, Seol Jihu placed down the boulder that fell from the sky back on the slope.", "Black Seol Jihu crossed his arms.", "It went without saying that Seol Jihu\u2019s proficiencies with the skills were less than his.

Once he climbed one wall, it would become a reliable stepping stone, and a robust road would be spread out in front of it.", "Of course, this road would not remain flat forever. It would steepen the further he walked, and he would eventually come across another wall.", "A wall \u2014 known as one\u2019s limit \u2014 that would be far taller and larger than the previous one.", "But that wasn\u2019t the case now. He had a long way to go before he needed to worry about reaching his limit.", "At least for now, he could run forward as much as he wanted.", "After walking for an unknown amount of time, Seol Jihu suddenly stopped and looked back.
