They had breakfast together, and she even participated in his morning training routine. It was as if she was thinking at least a little bit about him.", "However, that only lasted for a short while. Sometime in the afternoon, she received a call through her personal communication crystal and hurriedly ran out of the office. She didn't even mention where she was going, too. As a matter of fact, she was in such a hurry that Seol Jihu couldn't even think about stopping her and ask.", "'She's definitely hiding something.'

He needed his undivided attention on training his abilities as well as his mana, after all. It was already hard to get any sort of improvement even after focusing every little fiber of his being, yet he was now mired in all sorts of distracting thoughts and so, it was rather impossible to get any training done at this rate.", "'Should I go and pay a visit to Maria to wish her well?'

No, uh, I mean, Miss Maria? I understand.\u201d", "The male probationary Priest replied courteously and guided Seol Jihu.", "The route they took was different from the last time; they didn't head to the residential area. Instead, they entered deeper into the temple grounds where foot traffic became progressively lesser and lesser.

Why were they all running away after knocking on the door? Was there a ding-dong-ditch culture here? Seol Jihu thought about all sorts of dumb things as he raised his voice.", "\u201cMiss Maria? It's me, Seol.\u201d ", "He didn't hear any reply. He only heard a soft, subtle sound of chik, chik from beyond the door. He waited for a little bit before cautiously opening the door.", "\u201cI'm coming in.\u201d ", "Kiik\u2026 Opening the door led him to an unexpectedly spacious room. It was so clean and tidy that he almost felt guilty trying to compare this place to Maria's former room.

And then, when she saw the food Seol Jihu brought along, the light in her eyes transformed immediately.", "\u201cAh, I was worried for nothing!\u201d ", "Swish! Maria grabbed and threw the towel off her forehead and hurriedly sat back up straight. She wiped away the water on her face with her sleeves and then, snatched the food basket in his hands.", "Just as the youth's expression became utterly dazed after discovering the water spray bottle on a table near the bed, Maria stopped fishing through the food basket and asked him.

Who the hell are you calling a damn kid.\u201d ", "Seol Jihu momentarily thought to himself, \u2018Huh, so she was eighteen years old, eh. She's still a high schooler, then,\u2019 before being punched in the face by a huge mental shock. She was equivalent to a second-year high schooler in the South Korean education system, yet she drank like a dang sailor??", "\u201cM-maybe, it's because you're a foreigner??\u201d ", "\u201cWhat on earth are you on about now?\u201d ", "Hng, She snorted unhappily and bit into a loaf of bread with a vengeance. Seeing her grab that bread with both hands and only move her head left and right to tear it off somehow reminded Seol Jihu of an otter eating a clam, and he thought she looked rather adorable right now.", "Nom, nom\u2026 Maria's cheeks puffed up when she opened her mouth to speak.", "\u201cWell, I still gotta commend you. I mean, you bothered to come to see me like this when you must be busy out of your mind.\u201d", "\u201cEh? Uhm, I\u2026.

I didn't mean it that way.\u201d ", "\u201cWell, I guess it can't be helped. I mean, Carpe Diem must be going through hell right now, anyway\u2026. Nom. Cheer up, okay?\u201d", "What was she talking all of a sudden? Seol Jihu's complexion waned in an instant. However, Maria was too focused on eating the delicious bread to notice the change in his face.", "\u201cSince you bothered to bring these, I shall gratefully accept them. I'm fine now, so you should get going. I saw Chohong's face earlier, and boy, it was no joke, I tell ya.\u201d", "\u2018Chohong? She was here?\u2019 Seol Jihu was about to ask what Maria was talking about, but his thoughts clicked into place in an instant. He could venture a guess and say that she knew what he didn't know. She seemed to be mistaken about something else as well.", "\u201c\u2026.Ahh, well, we came separately. We were supposed to meet up somewhere around here. By any chance, do you know where I might find her?\u201d", "\u201cShe's probably in the last room in this passageway.\u201d", "It sounded as if Chohong was quite close by.

The moment he left her room, though, his steps gained urgency.", "'The last room in this passageway.' ", "The last room located on the left side of the passageway had its door slightly ajar, and a sliver of light leaked out from the open gap. Following his intuition, he killed his footsteps and sneaked a look inside the room. First of all, he spotted a few number of people inside.", "Soft murmurs of people drifted in and out of his hearing. But his wandering eyes were fixed to a single spot. It was a certain woman lying on the sickbed. Perhaps she sensed the gaze on her because her left eye shifted and locked onto Seol Jihu's. At that moment, he forgot to breathe.", "\u201cMm? Agnes?\u201d ", "Cinzia saw that Agnes was silently looking at the door and shifted her own eyes in that direction. It was right then, the door issued sounds of being flung open. The crowd's attention was immediately shifted over there.

However, the metallic, bitter scent of blood strongly wafted in the air and rendered that simple description wholly inadequate for the situation. Towels soaked in blood were found liberally around the bed itself, and Agnes's entire body was wrapped in thick bandages. Not only that, even her face, with the sole exception of her left eye, was wrapped up tightly. If it weren't for that, he would not have recognized her.", "What on earth had happened to her? Agnes was a powerful Level 6 Archer class assassin only a step away from entering the Unique Rank.

Miss Agnes\u2026.\u201d", "Like a broken robot, Seol Jihu repeated the same words over and over again. Just from looking, one could tell what he was feeling at the moment, so Agnes shifted her gaze away and let a groan leak out of her mouth.

This friend is also a member of Carpe Diem.\u201d", "The latter voice also belonged to another familiar person. It was Ian, currently lying on another sickbed similar to Agnes's.

Seol Jihu was feeling too confused right now. He just couldn't figure out what the hell happened. Meanwhile, Chohong was chewing on her lower lip with a complicated look on her face. He shot a silent glare at her for a second or two before shifting his eyes to somewhere else. He hoped for someone, anyone, to provide a clue.", "After a moment of heavy silence, Cinzia, standing tall with her arms crossed and her index fingers lightly drumming on her arms, let a long groan escape from her mouth.", "\u201cLooks like an apology is in order.\u201d ", "An apology?

How did things get to that situation?\u201d ", "The Parasites were a race that fundamentally survived by parasitizing off other lifeforms. It didn't matter whether it was a corpse or not \u2013 they relied on taking over and wrestling away the control of bodies to shore up their fighting forces.", "Both the Federation and humans weren't idiots. Once the Beastmen Alliance got destroyed \u2013 or, more correctly, after the Parasites used their corpses to parasitize and proliferate in massive numbers \u2013 the two remaining forces came up with a new strategy. And that would be to incinerate any remains, whether they be of allies or enemies. They chose to burn them all away because they would become the enemy's combat force if left alone.", "However, the Parasite Queen wasn't sitting around doing nothing. As if to ridicule the efforts of the two forces, she created existences called Nests.", "Originally, the Parasite as a species lacked the ability to conceive and give birth. No one knew just what kind of witchery was involved in this whole thing, but Nests acting like pregnant mothers and new types of Parasites being born from that ability gave incredible shock to other forces.", "That alone was already a massive source of headache, yet now, the supposedly-annihilated race of Ogres made an appearance, too?", "\u201cThat Parasite whore is probably telling us that she isn\u2019t gonna sit back and watch the current situation develop.\u201d", "Huuu\u2026.

The Federation might have welcomed the Cave Fairies into their coalition, but even then, they were only able to barely hang on against the concerted assault of the Parasites. And that delicate balance was tilting against their favor all because of the mutated Ogre's entrance.", "However, the story might change if the Federation and humans decided to join forces. Although humanity was the weakest of the lot, they were backed by the seven gods representing the Seven Sins. Along with the mass introduction of Earthlings, they could no longer be looked down that easily.", "But, seeing that the situation had become like this\u2026.", "\u201cLooks like that bitch is sure of it after the Arden Fortress incident.

The difference between attacking and defending was as great as heaven and earth itself.", "Humans had never taken the initiative to attack first ever since the invasion began. Not only that, they were already in a bit of tight spot trying to defend themselves. But now, they were going to attack the enemy camp? It was already unknown whether the assault would even materialize, and even if it did, it would not be much different than delivering themselves to the open jaw of the tiger anyway.", "\u201cWhat about cooperating with the Federation?\u201d", "\u201cWe already thought about it. They were the ones that gave us the information to begin with, so they must be operating their own infiltration squads, but\u2026.\u201d ", "Ian pondered deeply for a while, before shaking his head.", "\u201cThey most likely have suffered tremendous losses trying to defend themselves until now. More importantly, judging from the fact that they had to give up on Tigol Fortress, we should consider that the Federation is also having a very hard time as well.\u201d", "Seol Jihu unconsciously gripped his fists tighter.", "To this extent\u2026. Were the differences in strengths this great? Did this mean he had no choice but to watch from the sidelines while sucking on his thumbs?", "\u201cThe notion of a rock and a hard place never felt truer in my life before. We're still trying to find a way, yet we can't seem to find an answer.\u201d ", "\u2018What should I do?\u2019 Seol Jihu desperately combed through his memories. Unfortunately, there was no way he'd remember the contents of a dream he had so long ago.", "'I should have jotted down everything as soon as I woke up.'", "\u201cIf only someone like Sung Shihyun was still around\u2026.\u201d ", "The dejected Ian lamented with an energyless voice.", "It was then Seol Jihu opened his mouth again.", "\u201cWhere?\u201d ", "\u201cMm?\u201d", "\u201cThat facility. Where is it located?\u201d ", "Ian didn't immediately answer but chose to seek out Chohong's response. However, although she looked mighty unhappy right now, she still didn't say anything. No, she simply tutted and avoided making eye contact. Ian guessed what was in her mind and cautiously spoke up.", "\u201cSeol, I must emphasize that this is not a matter that you can interfere with. It's not possible, and it should not be.\u201d ", "\u201cMaster Ian.\u201d", "\u201cPlease, do not misunderstand me. I'm not looking down on your capabilities. However, both the events of the Forest of Denial and the defense of Arden Fortress were child's play compared to this one. No, more importantly, this matter could be the epoch-changing event that decides the flow of history from henceforth.\u201d", "\u201cYou can still tell me the location, can't you?\u201d", "Ian licked his lips a little. He took a bit of time to decide, before\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.Well, if it's only the location.\u201d", "He spoke with a helpless expression.", "\u201cIt's in Delpinion Duchy.\u201d ", "And, at that moment\u2026.", "\u201cIt's the royal laboratory.\u201d ", "\u2026.Seol Jihu's eyes gleamed brightly."]}
