She locked her hands, her legs parted slightly, and her back bent forward a little.", "\u201cHey, let me tell you something. You showing up here today, that's not a problem, in all honesty.\u201d ", "It was as if she was trying not to sound angry, but the tone was really too low for a woman's voice.

Not only that, Chohong's fist blocked by that hand, too.", "'But, when?!' ", "He failed to even notice her throwing a punch, never mind her arm moving before that.

If you come out like that, it's like this whole thing is true, so stop it.\u201d ", "She must have been really freaked out because her voice was quivering noticeably now.", "\u201cI understand. I also thought it was a bunch of baloney when I heard it the first time, too.\u201d ", "Dylan chuckled as if he found this whole thing rather interesting and got up from his seat.", "\u201cI guess I'll just confirm it for myself, then.\u201d", "He leisurely went off somewhere and when he returned, he was carrying a large, clear crystal ball. He placed it on the coffee table and placed his hand on top \u2013 and then, the crystal began emitting light.", "'What\u2019s that?\u2019", "Seol Jihu's curiosity perked up at seeing an object he had not seen before.", "A short while later, the crystal's entire surface was enveloped in a soft glow.

Did you call me because you were also curious about that?", "Cackling laughter came out from the crystal ball.", "Seol Jihu dazedly stared at the crystal. Ever since his arrival in Haramark, one thing or another managed to surprise him constantly.", "That was Cinzia on the other side. She sure looked like someone pretty powerful when he first saw her in the Neutral Zone. But after seeing Dylan chatting so easily to someone even Kim Hannah referred to as a big shot in Paradise, Seol Jihu had no choice but to view Dylan in a new light.", "\u2014You\u2019re not the only one to have asked me about this.

Been a while.\u201d ", "\u2014It really has. Feels like I haven't seen you in ages.", "\u201cOkay, fine. I know, so please hurry up with the story!\u201d", "Chohong urged Cinzia to move on.", "\u2014Fine, fine. Took first place with a points tally of 26,500. Solo cleared the Neutral Zone's missions up to Hard difficulty. Formed a team with five others afterwards and successfully cleared all of the Very Hard difficulty missions.

There are many things we're curious about, and what with this being such an unbelievable story to begin with, please do try to understand where we're coming from, okay?\u201d ", "Dylan's calm voice seemed to possess this mystifying ability to calm all those listening to him.", "\u201cIt's fine.\u201d ", "\u201cThanks. Mm, right. About the job posting.\u201d ", "Dylan stopped there and wordlessly stared at Seol. The youth stiffened slightly in nervousness as the big guy studied every square inch of his face.", "A short moment of silence later, Dylan continued on.", "\u201cI'd like to hear your honest answer to my question.\u201d ", "\u201cOf course.\u201d ", "\u201cAlright. What was your reason for choosing us?\u201d ", "This question took Seol by surprise.", "\u201cWith that kind of a record, you could have chosen any of the powerful organizations in Paradise and they would have welcomed you with open arms. I'm wondering why you chose to come to Haramark and knock on Carpe Diem's door instead of theirs.", "Seol Jihu became speechless, then. What Kim Hannah told him wasn't something he'd walk around telling everyone he met, and also, he couldn't come out and say, \u201cI activated my Nine Eyes in front of the noticeboard, and the parchment you placed there was glowing in gold color signifying the Golden Commandment.\u201d", "\u201cUhm\u2026..\u201d", "Seol Jihu hesitated for a long time, before replying with an awkward smile on his face.", "\u201cWell, I like your training facility\u2026.\u201d", "Dylan slowly closed his eyes.", "*", "\u201cHaaaaaah\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu returned to 'Eat, Drink And Enjoy', found a place to sit, and began grandly sighing out.", "The pub remained as noisy as before. But he didn't care about that at the moment. His head was filled with the recollections of the moment he got rejected to notice his surroundings.", "[My bad, but looks like we can't work together.]", "[And if I were to give you advice, you should leave Haramark as soon as possible. You will find many good teams in other cities. Starting in those places might be a better choice for you.]", "Seol Jihu couldn't say anything to this simple yet resolute and firm rejection.", "In the end, he could only return to the pub and mournfully sip on the alcoholic beverage.", "He came to Haramark full of dreams, yet his current situation, having nowhere else to go, seemed too pitiful even to his own eyes.", "Seol Jihu rested his chin on his hand and pouted with a worried expression etched on his face. If only it weren't for Sinyoung\u2026. He might have joined up with a good team in Scheherazade by now and be away on an adventure already.", "'Maybe, I should've just joined Sinyoung in the first place?'

He was so happy and content while in the Neutral Zone, but now that he was outside, he sure felt like a fool now.", "Also, he knew that he couldn't continue to do nothing and suck on his thumbs forever, even though he had a bit of money on him.", "'I wanna do something.'", "The issue was with his low level.", "He was a Level 1. More importantly, there was no team stupid enough to let a novice Warrior join them when there were so many of them out there to begin with.", "'There's nothing I can do, I guess. I gotta start from the bottom as a porter and work my way up\u2026.'", "Just as he pulled out a cigarette and lit it up while feeling a bit uneasy\u2026.", "Slam!", "There was a loud noise of someone hitting the table, and then\u2026.", "\u201cEveryone, your attention, please!\u201d", "A man's loud shout brought silence into the once-noisy establishment.", "Seol Jihu took a glance and saw a man standing there with a hand raised up in the air. He was built quite lean, and his long hair extended down to his waist.", "\u201cIs there a skilled Warrior or a Priest among you? Ah, I'm also searching for a porter as well, so it does not matter if your level is low.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you talking about, Samuel?\u201d", "A guy sitting on the table next to the man, Samuel, asked while chewing on a snack. Samuel lowered his hand and answered.", "\u201cIt's a mission issued by the royal family. We'll be scouting the Forest of Denial.\u201d ", "\u201cEii, fuck that. Why would I go to that godforsaken place?\u201d", "The guy mouthed some snide remarks and went back to mind his own business. Others displayed roughly a similar attitude. Some shook their heads, while a few others began smirking derisively.", "However, Seol Jihu was different. He activated Nine Eyes as soon as hearing that a porter would be hired, and the result was \u2013 Samuel had no colors on him.", "'Should I?'", "At least, there were no colors related to danger. Also, he was not really in a situation to be picky.", "He should try to grasp every opportunity that had presented itself. Seol moved, thinking that at the bare minimum, he should listen to what the other party had to say before deciding.", "Samuel showed complete disregard towards the reactions of his fellow pub-goers, but when he saw Seol Jihu's approach, a bright smile lit up on his face.", "\u201cOho! Our first lucky person arrives.\u201d ", "\u201cI heard that you're looking for a porter.\u201d ", "\u201cIndeed. You have any prior experience?\u201d ", "\u201cNo, this will be my first time.\u201d ", "\u201cFirst time?\u201d ", "Samuel looked a bit troubled, then.", "'Will this be a no, too?' ", "\u201cI agree!\u201d ", "It was then, Seol Jihu heard a rather familiar voice. Samuel turned around to look.", "\u201cYou know this guy, Alex?\u201d", "\u201cYup. And I'm completely on board with this idea. And I guarantee that you won't regret it.\u201d ", "Seol Jihu blinked his eyes after hearing the name Alex. There was a familiar young man wearing a Priest outfit sitting around Samuel's table waving his hand at him.", "\u201cIf Alex guarantees it, then I guess it's not so bad. Alright, then! Come join us here!\u201d ", "Samuel nodded his head and pulled Seol Jihu into one of the empty seats.", "\u201cAlex.\u201d", "\u201cGood to see you again. I had no idea that we'd run into each other so quickly.\u201d ", "\u201cYes, me too.\u201d ", "\u201cI'm actually a member of Samuel's team, you see. By the way\u2026. I see that you're a man at the end of the day. Hehehehe.\u201d ", "Alex began grinning in a sly manner.", "\u201cWoah, woah. I can see that you two are pretty familiar with each other, so why don't you give us a chance to say hello, too?\u201d ", "Samuel waved his hand around between the two youths and reached for a handshake.", "\u201cHey, there. Name's Samuel. I\u2019m the leader of this team. I'm a Level 4 Pathfinder.\u201d", "\u201cI'm Seol. A level 1 Warrior.\u201d", "\u201cKuheu! I love how polite Asians are!\u201d", "Samuel then triumphantly pointed to his left. A brunette woman with curly hair as well as a woman with short, bright platinum blonde hair sat to his side.", "\u201cYou already know Alex, so I'll exclude him. Firstly, this lady here~ She's Clara, a Level 2 Hunter. And next to her is~ Grace, a Level 3 Shield Swordswoman. In a way, you could say that she's your senior.\u201d", "Two women raised her hands at the same time and waved at him. Seol Jihu also raised his head and waved back, prompting the two ladies to giggle among themselves. For some reason, they kept stealing glances at his way.", "\u201cOh, yeah. You said it'll be your first time as a porter?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cIt's not going to be a tough job, actually. We'll be asking you every now and then to take care of some small things, but on the whole, just think of your job as carrying our luggage around for the entire duration of the expedition.\u201d", "\u201cIs that all I have to do?\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head slightly, thinking this would be too simple if that were the case.", "\u201cMm! Of course, there are a few rules you gotta stick by. First of all, you can't fall behind in the middle of the trip. It'd get troublesome if you end up holding us back, you know what I mean? And then, you shouldn't rashly jump into a fight, too. Things might get complicated, and we aren't expecting a porter to fight for us, either. So, how about it? It's easy, right?\u201d ", "\u201cYes, it sounds easy.\u201d ", "\u201cGood! Now, let's talk about splitting our rewards. First of all, a porter has no right to ask for any artifacts recovered during an expedition. Do you agree?\u201d ", "Seol Jihu had no idea what this 'artifact' thing could be but still agreed nonetheless. This was a rule every Earthling should be aware of already, but since it would be Seol's first time as a porter, Samuel was actually going out of his way to explain things.", "\u201cGood. As for other rewards, we split everything equally.\u201d ", "\u201cReally?\u201d ", "Seol was taken back by this proposal. He was thinking that he'd be nothing more than a glorified slave but now that he heard the terms, it was better than he expected.", "\u201cYou're splitting equally even with a porter?\u201d", "\u201cObviously. A porter is still a member of the team, right?\u201d", "Samuel looked befuddled as if he couldn't quite understand why the youth was asking this question, which only led Seol further down the Confusion Avenue. However, the Pathfinder quickly realized what happened here, and a wry smile formed on his face.", "\u201cYeah, I heard that there are some teams out there that treat their porters like slaves, but I'm not one of them. You're an Earthling like me, and you are just trying to earn some experience, after all.\u201d ", "He was implying that, in Lost Paradise, the relationship between a team and a porter was a mutually beneficial one.", "\u201cYou help us and let us focus on the expedition, and we will protect you from the danger. Okay?\u201d ", "\u201cI understand.\u201d", "\u201cHowever, don't expect to be treated too nicely, okay? You being a part of the team will make it a bit easier for the rest of us, but if you weren't here, then we'd have carried our own luggage, anyway.\u201d ", "When considering the fact that most of the Earthlings would start as a porter regardless of whether one was a Contracted or an Invited, Samuel's words were being rather considerate.", "\u201cOkay, now. Time to get to the main topic at hand.\u201d ", "Samuel formed a sly smile and then, he suddenly got very close to Seol's ear in order to whisper something.", "\u201cI hope that you didn't think I'd be really going on a recon to the Forest of Denial.\u201d", "Hearing that hushed whisper, Seol Jihu's expression became hard to read as well.", "\u201cOh. Of course, we will carry out our mission, no problem. However\u2026. Oopsie. We should finish our chat elsewhere.\u201d", "Samuel whispered up to there and pointed to the exit of the pub with his chin.", "\u201cFollow us. Let's talk somewhere a bit quieter. When you hear what I have to say, even you'll think that you've stumbled upon a jackpot. I guarantee it.\u201d ", "Samuel winked and shouted out, \u201cLet's get out of here!\u201d before energetically standing up from his seat.", "\u201cLet's go. Decide after hearing us out. If you don't like what you hear, then you can opt to leave afterwards.\u201d", "Alex also voiced his opinion. Seol Jihu wondered whether there really was a need to change the venue, but he didn't say anything and got up as well.", "Alex stood up with a happy smile on his face and muttered out.", "\u201cI've got a good feeling about this expedition.\u201d", "\u201cHow come?\u201d", "\u201cBecause we're getting a Level 3 Warrior as a porter. You wouldn't find something so ridiculous in any other teams around these parts.\u201d ", "\u201cI'm a Level 1 though.\u201d", "\u201cSure, sure.\u201d", "Alex giggled hoarsely.", "*", "In Carpe Diem's office.", "After Seol Jihu left, the office remained eerily quiet for some time.", "Each of them had a lot to think about. Dylan stared outside and continued to suck hard on his cigarette, while Hugo formed a facial expression that cried out 'I don't understand what happened.'", "\u201cEiii, shit. How fucking embarrassing.\u201d ", "Chohong laid down on the couch and continued to complain.", "\u201cReally? Fuck me. Just how the hell did he clear it?\u201d ", "While Chohong continued to voice her dissatisfaction, Hugo finally opened his mouth to ask.", "\u201cDylan, I still don't get it.\u201d ", "Chohong quickly shot him a glare from the corner of her eyes. Hugo waved his hand around to indicate that he knew.", "\u201cI'm not saying I'm not gonna follow your decision since you're our leader and all, but I still don't get it. I mean, isn't he good enough for us to accept?\u201d", "\u201cNot at all.\u201d", "Dylan replied simply.", "\u201cIf you consider our team's unique nature, you should realize why we can't have him join us.\u201d ", "\u201cBut still\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWhat we need is a Warrior who can boost our combat potential right away. A newbie isn\u2019t suitable.\u201d", "Dylan finished there and continued to puff on his cigarette.", "\u201cDylan!\u201d ", "\u201cHugo, that's enough.\u201d", "Chohong butted in while scratching her head.", "\u201cThe current leader of Carpe Diem is Dylan. The old man personally appointed him. Let's not waste time arguing about this anymore.\u201d ", "\u201cI know that you are right, but man. Ehew.\u201d ", "Hugo sighed as if he was still ruing the missed opportunity. Dylan eventually killed the cigarette and slowly opened his mouth.", "\u201cHe had such clear eyes.\u201d ", "Chohong and Hugo turned their confused faces towards Dylan.", "\u201cWhat are you talking about, all of a sudden? Did some of the old man rub off on you or something?\u201d ", "\u201cHehe. Maybe. In any case, that guy named Seol. It is a bit regrettable. I understand where Hugo's coming from.\u201d", "\u201cThat's right! So, like, let's bring him under our wings! Weren't we newbies once upon a time, too?\u201d ", "\u201cSeol is a blank canvas.\u201d", "Dylan calmly replied.", "\u201cHe's a huge blank canvas, unsullied by any paint whatsoever. I can't even begin to fathom how big the dimensions of this canvas is, so how can I, or anyone else for that matter, carelessly throw some paint around on it?\u201d", "\u201cWhat the hell. Talk in a way so I can understand what you're on about, will ya?\u201d", "Hugo complained bitterly, causing Dylan to form a slight smirk.", "\u201cI acknowledge that he's incredible, but he's still a Level 1. He doesn't know a lot, so he's bound to make a few mistakes, too.\u201d", "\u201cThat, is, why!\u201d", "\u201cThat is why he can't join teams like ours.\u201d ", "Hugo was shouting out at the top of voice from sheer frustration, only to fall utterly dazed from those words.", "Dylan continued on.", "\u201cThis is the most important time for Seol. This is the time when his future path is determined and when his unbelievable potential starts to reveal itself.\u201d", "\u201cAre you saying we aren't good enough for him?\u201d ", "\u201cRather than us not being good enough, it's more to do with who we are. We always fight with our lives on the line. We've experienced all sorts of shit and have also grown cynical in the process. What would a guy like Seol learn from us, then?\u201d", "Dylan's calm explanations meant Hugo couldn't come up with anything.", "\u201cThis is how I see it. Perfectly covering for his mistakes from behind, and leading him from the front while teaching him all he needs to know\u2026. Seol needs to join a team like that.

And you know that the old man is about to retire soon.\u201d", "Dylan firmly stated his position, and let off a long sigh.", "\u201cAlright. Let's stop talking about this matter and move on. We should get going anyways.\u201d ", "\u201cTo where?\u201d ", "Choi Hong asked this time.", "\u201cWork. It's a request from Samuel's team. Hugo, get up, man.

Anyway, what work are we talking about here?\u201d ", "\u201cLooks like we'll have to hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
