{"cid": "218", "title": "Chapter 218. Unfulfillable Wish (2)", "content": ["The interior of the golden palace truly boasted the pinnacle of flamboyance. Golden symbols were engraved on a lustrous marble background, and even the windowsills had a gold outline.", "And with all sorts of decorative items placed everywhere, the palace reminded everyone of France\u2019s Palace of Versailles, which was known for its marvelous beauty.", "\u201cI am very pleased that you think so highly of this poor palace.\u201d", "A soprano-tone voice, like that of a skylark, rang out in everyone\u2019s ears, and their eyes naturally headed forward.", "A throne made of gold was standing at the end of the vast hallway, which extended like a corridor. And there was a woman slowly standing up from this throne, looking down amiably at the expedition team.", "The figure looked young and frail, and didn\u2019t seem to even reach 150 centimeters. Her blue hair was slicked back and tied into a bun, emphasizing her small, white face even more.", "Indeed, rather than a woman, it seemed more proper to call her a young lady.", "Clack\u2026 clack\u2026", "Seol Jihu snapped out of his daze hearing the clacking of heels. The young lady was walking down the stairs with modest steps, her hands clasped over her bellybutton.", "As she came closer, her attire became easier to see. The top of her clothing was a black, gothic lolita-style dress, which stuck to her body and outlined her alluring curves, and the bottom was a wide, bell-shaped skirt that reached her ankles.", "\u201cThank you accepting my invitation.\u201d", "After reaching the bottom of the stairs, she lightly held the hem of her skirt up and bowed politely.", "\u201cWelcome to the Pagoda of Dreams, Legitimate Visitors.\u201d", "She scanned the expedition team briefly. Then\u2026", "\u201cAnd Awaited Experts.\u201d", "She smiled at Seol Jihu and Teresa. Her smile was so captivating that she grabbed everyone\u2019s attention instantly.", "However, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t let his guard down. The young lady\u2019s mouth was curled into a smile, but her clear, ocean-like blue pupils were serene like ice.", "In the first place, Seol Jihu felt a strong sense of incongruity the moment he entered the place. A single young lady was the only one in such a huge palace? He felt like he was dreaming.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. My reception hasn\u2019t been the best, even though such honored guests accepted my invitation. Please forgive this lady\u2019s lack of thought with magnanimity.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was taken aback. He hadn\u2019t said anything, yet the young lady seemed to have read his thoughts.", "Her eyes then gently curled into a crescent shape as she raised both her hands.", "Clap!", "She clapped.", "Tutururu~!", "Seol Jihu almost fell backward in shock. It wasn\u2019t just him, but everyone in the expedition team.", "People filled up the palace instantly. They circled around the expedition team, sang, played music, and threw flower petals into the air.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be so surprised.\u201d", "A muffled giggle rang out.", "\u201cThis is the world of my mind.\u201d", "A dreamy voice flowed out rhythmically.", "\u201cSince this is a dream world, everything I wish for comes true.\u201d", "Roselle flicked her hand like the conductor of a symphonic orchestra, and the people disappeared in an instant. The palace regained its serenity.", "\u201cDid you like my welcoming show?\u201d", "She asked, her head slightly tilted.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t say anything, setting aside whether he liked it or not. He had experienced all sorts of things thus far, but this was the first time he was experiencing anything similar to what he was experiencing today.", "\u201cNow.\u201d", "Roselle clapped again, and the scenery changed. The expedition team was now standing in the middle of a beautiful garden.", "A white, round table was placed in front of them, with pretty steaming tea cups placed on top of it.", "\u201cThough it\u2019s a little late, let me introduce myself.\u201d", "The young lady gently placed her hand over her chest.", "\u201cMy name is Roselle La Grazia.\u201d", "Seol Jihu barely managed to eke out a few words.", "\u201cThe Witch of Dreams\u2026\u201d[1]", "\u201cYes, I was once called by that insignificant name.\u201d", "Roselle smiled brightly before sitting down on a chair elegantly. She then opened her palm and pointed at the other chairs.", "\u201cPlease, sit.\u201d", "Seol Jihu hesitated for a moment, but soon steeled his resolve. The Witch of Dreams was treating them properly both as the master of this place and as the one who had invited them.", "As such, it was only proper that they treat her with the same level of respect as her guests.", "\u2018Do unto others as they do unto you.\u2019", "\u201cThank you!\u201d", "Once Seol Jihu sat down, his comrades began to sit one by one. But when everyone sat down, there was one seat left open.", "\u201cWill the lady inside the pendant not sit?\u201d", "Roselle spoke with a dreamy voice.", "[!?]", "\u2018She knows?\u2019", "Seol Jihu opened his mouth in a fluster.", "\u201cAh, she\u2019s not good with strangers\u2026 she gets a little shy.\u201d", "\u201cEh? The esteemed daughter of the Rothschear House is\u2026 shy?\u201d", "Roselle looked surprised.", "\u201cI see\u2026 I was hoping to talk about all sorts of things with her\u2026\u201d", "Just as she reached out to the table with a slightly disappointed look\u2014", "[Did Grandpa come here?]", "Flone hurriedly asked. Roselle didn\u2019t say anything. She only stared at the pendant with a smile on her face.", "[Ah, um\u2026]", "Flone must have made a mistake as she stuttered. She continued hesitantly.", "[Excuse me\u2026 I subconsciously blurted out\u2026]", "Flone spoke with an elegant mannerism, which wasn\u2019t like her normal self.", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s completely fine.\u201d", "Roselle spoke without losing her smile.", "\u201cBoth you and I are already dead. There\u2019s no reason to upkeep customs from when we were alive.\u201d", "[\u2026.]", "\u201cAlso, I heard that the youngest daughter of the Rothschear House is a pampered tomboy.\u201d", "[!]", "\u2018Pampered? Tomboy?\u2019", "The pendant shook like a flailing flounder. Roselle stared at it as if it was cute before clearing her throat.", "\u201cTo answer your question, yes, the head of the Rothschear House has indeed visited the Pagoda of Dreams. Realizing the greedy emperor was eyeing him, he requested that I hold onto a portion of the Rothschear\u2019s inheritance. Although this happened hundreds of years ago, I remember it clearly.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t miss Roselle\u2019s eyebrows turning sharp when she mentioned the emperor.", "\u201cTo be honest, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the Spear of the Empire either, but since I hated the emperor more, I accepted the Rothschear Head\u2019s request.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2014\u201d", "\u201cYes, I am still safekeeping the inheritance.\u201d", "Roselle answered as if she knew what Seol Jihu would ask. Then, she paused in the middle of elegantly raising her teacup. An intrigued smile bloomed on her face.", "Roselle opened her mouth.", "\u201cAh, fuck.\u201d", "Seol Jihu doubted his ears.", "\u201cThis is getting boring. Just give us our shit and let us go. Why did this bitch even invite us in the first place?\u201d", "Roselle spoke monotonously.", "\u201cHiiiiiik!?\u201d", "Maria screamed.", "Seol Jihu exclaimed inwardly.", "\u2018No way.\u2019", "Maria slammed her head down and pleaded.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Please don\u2019t kill me!\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Roselle covered her mouth, smiled, then shook her head.", "\u201cI would have picked fault with it if you said it out loud, but you only thought it. It\u2019s my fault for reading your mind without permission. It\u2019s a bad habit of mine, you see.\u201d", "Maria stealthily raised her head.", "\u201cI can give you the Rothschear House\u2019s inheritance whenever. If you\u2019d like, I can give it to you this instant.\u201d", "Roselle took a sip of her tea, then carefully put the teacup down.", "\u201cBut I would be extremely grateful if you all would listen to why I invited you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu opened his mouth.", "\u201cOf course. By the way\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYes, as I said before, I am someone who died hundreds of years ago. My body most likely turned to ash and scattered away, so not a single piece of it should remain in the world. The person you are talking to now is\u2014\u201d", "Seol Jihu closed his mouth, not being able to finish saying \u2018You said you died in the past.\u2019", "\u201cAn existence that is a mere remnant thought.\u201d", "For some reason, this woman\u2026", "\u201c\u2026is full of herself. It\u2019s something I heard a lot when I was alive because of my habit of reading other people\u2019s thoughts. Please excuse my behavior.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Ah, yes.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it now. I can hold myself back if it\u2019s just for a little bit.\u201d", "Seol Jihu let out a dry cough.", "\u201cWhen I looked at the historical records, everything regarding the Pagoda of Infection, or rather Dreams, was erased.\u201d", "\u201cYes, it was a rather effective measure.\u201d", "Roselle replied firmly.", "\u201cI dearly wished that the dream infection would reach the emperor, but I never imagined he would respond so strongly as soon as it began to spread.\u201d", "Roselle then added, \u201cHe had many enemies, so he was always in a hurry to protect himself.\u201d", "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much I could do back then. I formed a powerful curse around the pagoda so no one could approach it, but I also couldn\u2019t step a foot outside of it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu examined Roselle closely. This witch had once planned to overthrow the Empire. But setting aside how incredible she was, he questioned her methods. Strictly speaking, the Pagoda of Dreams\u2019 infection would have negatively affected the Empire\u2019s innocent civilians.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. Because of my pagoda, countless good, law-abiding citizens died.\u201d", "Roselle admitted without reserve.", "\u201cBut I don\u2019t regret it. Because many followers of the emperor also died. And those people all deserved death.\u201d", "Seol Jihu became a bit afraid, hearing how she made it seem like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. He interlocked his fingers and asked.", "\u201cI\u2019d like to know why you went so far.\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d", "Roselle spoke in a singing tone.", "\u201cTo eliminate the war-crazed emperor\u2026\u201d", "Her tiny shoulders trembled faintly as she clutched her hands.", "\u201cAnd the tyrannous followers, who support him in his madness\u2026!\u201d", "Seol Jihu instinctively shrunk back as chills suddenly ran down his spine and goosebumps spread around his entire body.", "A bitter coldness shot out of Roselle\u2019s body like thorns. It was so cold that Seol Jihu imagined himself being in a large -40 degrees freezer. That was how enraged Roselle was.", "\u2018What power\u2026\u2019", "The energy she was giving off far surpassed that of Flone. Seol Jihu finally caught a glimpse of how powerful this witch was. She might be evenly matched even against a Parasite Army Commander.", "Roselle took a deep breath, then soothed her energy.", "\u201cExcuse me.\u201d", "Gasps flowed out from all directions.", "\u201cAnyway, after this decision by the emperor, I made every effort to strengthen the curse. But there was an undeniable limit with a mortal body. Even after painstaking effort, all I obtained was the qualification to pursue the origin\u2026\u201d", "Roselle blurred the end of her speech, trailing into a hard-to-understand concept.", "\u201cThere is one reason why I invited you all.\u201d", "After a brief moment of silence, Roselle took a sip of tea and spoke again.", "\u201cAlthough the curse\u2019s power has weakened immensely due to the passage of time, I spent my lifetime creating it. Since two of you were able to escape this curse through your own power, you must have strong willpower.\u201d", "\u2018That\u2019s not really it.\u2019", "Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "\u201cI will be open and honest. I am looking for someone who can fulfill the wish I failed to achieve in my lifetime.\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows. Roselle\u2019s wish had to be the collapse of the Empire.", "\u201cI know. The tyrannous emperor and his followers must have all died, and many things must have changed from the passage of time. Still\u2014 my desire to get revenge has not changed nor has it diminished. Going back to its founding, the Empire took root on a rotten ground, so it ought to be overthrown. Even if hundreds of years have passed since then.\u201d", "She must have misunderstood Seol Jihu\u2019s expression.", "\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t plan to force this task onto you.\u201d", "And she really must have stopped reading others\u2019 minds.", "\u201cAnd I am not requesting that you do something about it either.\u201d", "Or perhaps she didn\u2019t know anything about the outside situation due to being stuck in this place.", "\u201cBut if you do accept my request, I will also help you to the best of my abilities.\u201d", "No matter the case, she definitely had a huge misunderstanding.", "\u201cThis Pagoda of Dreams also has my inheritance. Its scale and importance are incomparable to that of the Rothschear House.\u201d", "Roselle spoke proudly as she strutted out her small chest.", "Seol Jihu blinked.", "\u2018This person isn\u2019t normal either, huh.\u2019", "Resentment that remains even after hundreds of years\u2026 It was hard to understand where her thirst for revenge was coming from. Although it was only a guess, it didn\u2019t seem like Roselle wanted to topple the Empire purely because of a war.", "\u2018There\u2019s another reason.\u2019", "There had to be a more certain reason that she hated the Empire\u2019s origin so much.", "In any case, Seol Jihu decided that it wasn\u2019t something the expedition team should be involved in. No, even if he wanted to help her out, her wish was no longer fulfillable.", "If there was one thing he could tell her, though\u2014", "That was to tell an important truth to the young lady, who had been living in a dream for hundreds of years.", "Roselle asked, her pupils sparkling.", "\u201cSo? What do you think? Ah, you can take your time before answering.\u201d", "Next, she raised her \u2153-full teacup.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "In a way, what Seol Jihu was about to tell her was cruel. So, he hesitated a little bit before speaking.", "\u201cIt may be presumptuous of me, but there is something I would like to tell you before saying yes or no.\u201d", "Roselle nodded her head, gesturing at him to go on.", "\u201cThe Empire\u2026\u201d", "With a short breath, Seol Jihu spoke firmly.", "\u201cHas already fallen.\u201d", "\u201cPfft!\u201d", "Tea gushed out of her small, cherry-like lips, splattering everywhere.", "Roselle went stiff and stood in place holding the teacup as if time had frozen for her. The only thing that showed she was still conscious was her busily blinking eyes.", "Seol Jihu opened his mouth and put the nail in the coffin.", "\u201cIt collapsed more than 10 years ago. Its people were killed regardless of their social status, and not a single tuft of grass remains on the Empire\u2019s territory.\u201d", "Slowly, very slowly, Roselle raised her head.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Silence descended once again. The fall of the Empire, which stood strong at the peak of Paradise for a long time, must have come as a huge shock because she only stared blankly without even thinking to put down her teacup.", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "Roselle\u2019s tightly shut mouth opened slightly.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "And Seol Jihu\u2026", "\u201cUm\u2026\u201d", "Was able to witness\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Excuse me???\u201d", "Her ever-smiling face crumble down in an instant.", "1. This title is slightly different from what the mechanical voice said in the last chapter. Last one specifically said \u201cThe Dreaming Witch\u201d while this one says \u201cThe Witch of Dreams\u201d. ", "Name changed to Roselle La Grazia (Italian pronunciation, kind of like Cinzia's name)."]}
