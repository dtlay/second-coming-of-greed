Argh, this is driving me nuts.\u201d", "\u201cAha, your teeth?\u201d Seeing the woman rubbing her jaw, her comrade cackled. \u201cQuit dreaming.

Although being called \u2018Valhalla Representative\u2019 and not \u2018Seol Jihu\u2019 was a little awkward, it helped him realize his new social standing.", "After spending a stormy morning, Seol Jihu was finally able to take a breather around noon.", "\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d", "\u201cThen I\u2019m there.\u201d", "\u201cPyak.\u201d", "\u201cWhat, you want one too?\u201d", "\u201cPpi.\u201d", "\u201cYou know, you\u2019re pretty cheeky for a little chick.\u201d", "Valhalla\u2019s members were busy playing a game.

In fact, he felt like a huge burden had been lifted from his shoulders.", "This morning, he had gone to the palace and received total authority over five districts of Eva. He had finally achieved one of the three goals he set when he came to Eva.", "They were all grand visions that he was not sure he could accomplish, but in the end, he had achieved his first goal magnificently.", "For Seol Jihu, the sense of accomplishment outshined the happiness from rising to a high position. Opening his eyes, he gave a deep sigh.", "As he looked around the empty conference room, his eyes filled up with a dream.", "He accomplished something huge, but he was only getting started.", "Using the goal he recently accomplished as a stepping stone, he had to race toward the second goal. And before he could do that\u2014", "Kiik. Seol Jihu\u2019s thoughts cut off, and he turned to the entrance.", "As the door slowly opened, a ponytailed woman wearing a neat business suit walked in.

Urgent, too.\u201d", "\u201cAnxious?\u201d", "Kim Hannah asked back as if she didn\u2019t expect this response.", "\u201cAnxious about what? Well, I guess technically there are still some things, if I think about it.\u201d", "\u201cAbout the Parasites, I mean.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nibbled on his lips.", "\u201cThey\u2019re quiet. Almost too quiet. I thought they would somehow respond to their defeat in Arden Valley, but there hasn\u2019t been anything.\u201d", "Just what could they be planning to be so silent?", "\u201c\u2026I guess so. Although they say no news is good news, that doesn\u2019t apply to the Parasite Queen.\u201d", "Kim Hannah nodded her head in understanding.", "\u201cWhat did you mean by urgent?\u201d", "\u201cThe second goal.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke in a low voice.", "\u201cIt\u2019s related to what I just told you about.

I don\u2019t know what thoughts you have about it, but\u2026\u201d", "He looked up at Kim Hannah, who was staring down at him quietly, before continuing.", "\u201cI feel like I need to rush to achieve the second goal. That\u2019s the only thing in my mind right now.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled faintly.", "\u201cYou know what I sometimes feel?\u201d", "She took out a few pieces of paper from her handbag, then put them down in front of Seol Jihu.", "\u201cI feel like you don\u2019t know how to be satisfied.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m praising you. I like people who keep their promises.\u201d", "Saying things that were hard to understand, she slid off the table. Seol Jihu stared at Kim Hannah as she walked farther away.", "\u201cKim Hannah?\u201d", "\u201cThat report\u2026\u201d", "Her unique business voice rang out in the conference room.", "\u201c\u2026is a brief organized summary of the direction Valhalla will take from now on.\u201d", "A light flickered in Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes. Kim Hannah\u2019s manner of speech suddenly switched completely. Rather, the entire air around her changed.", "Clack, clack. After stopping at exactly the tenth step, Kim Hannah turned around.", "\u201cI planned to do this a long time ago, but\u2026\u201d", "She cupped her hands together, stood tall, and spoke with her eyes lowered.", "\u201cFrom today onwards, I will be speaking to Representative Seol with respect for all official matters.\u201d", "Her courteous manner of speech made Seol Jihu blink rapidly. He glanced at the report in front of him, then waved his hand.", "\u201cEii, it\u2019s fine. Just act like you normally do. That\u2019s better.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s awkward when you speak so formally.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tried to liven the atmosphere with an evasive smile, but he could only stop smiling in the next moment.", "Because Kim Hannah\u2019s attitude made it seem like she was not fooling around.", "Feeling awkward, Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "\u201cDo you really need to?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Kim Hannah replied without a shred of hesitation.", "\u201cI must. Because you, Representative Seol, are no longer the leader of a small team that can be found in any city.\u201d", "She was telling him to carry himself with the dignity that befitted his position.", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips. To be honest, he didn\u2019t really like it. Rather than distancing himself and acting stiff just because he had a higher position, he felt it suited his style more to laugh and have fun together.", "But he figured there had to be a reason Kim Hannah was saying this. She must think it was necessary for their future plans.", "Seol Jihu somewhat understood where she was coming from. As their force grew bigger and more people gathered together, people\u2019s relationships would increasingly grow more complex.", "When that happened, all sorts of problems might occur, and some may even lead to falling outs.", "In such a complex web of relationships, an organization needed a strong core to withstand the waves that could shake its foundation.", "[I figured it wouldn\u2019t be bad to work under a leader who\u2019s fair in settling personal affairs.]", "He remembered the words Kazuki said to him a long time ago.", "An organization\u2019s representative had to be fair. Although it wasn\u2019t bad to be lax and comfortable with ordinary members, there were also times when they needed to be sturdy and unmoving like a rock.", "To not be swept away.", "Kim Hannah must have brought this up for this reason.", "\u201cCurrently, Valhalla is not doing so well internally.\u201d", "Interpreting Seol Jihu\u2019s silence as an acknowledgment, Kim Hannah continued.", "\u201cI am not talking about the atmosphere. Although Valhalla became an organization representing a city, it is not a group that befits the position of the royal partner. Strictly speaking, that is.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded. Looking back, they had climbed to this position through war, strength, and strategy. They had skipped all the intermediary processes that any new organization would need to go through.", "Like the saying, those who live by politics die by politics, those who flourished by war would fall by war.", "This must have been what Kim Hannah was worried about.", "\u201cI understand your concern regarding your goals, but now is not the time to be hasty. Rather than starting something new, it\u2019s time to do what should have been done already.\u201d", "Not starting something new, but coming together internally and strengthening the foundation.", "Seol Jihu asked while grabbing the report.", "\u201cWhat do you think needs to be done most urgently?\u201d", "\u201cThere are several things. Recruiting new members, calling forces who share our values to Eva and forming an alliance, these are both important\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah took a brief pause before continuing.", "\u201cBut the most important thing is to set up a proper internal structure.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAnd I\u2019m talking about a complete overhaul to the current structure. It\u2019s already late. The more we delay it, the more difficult it will get.\u201d", "Seol Jihu listened silently as he had been told this a few times before.", "\u201cIn this world, there are no organizations without structure. An army has a ranking structure, a company has a corporate structure, and even internet clubs, cafes, and mothers\u2019 associations have separate admins or managers.\u201d", "Kim Hannah cleared her throat.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is finding out what structure Valhalla wants to implement. What structure we use will decide the organization\u2019s direction and nature.\u201d", "And this structure must adhere to the representative\u2019s goals. An organization with a focus on making money would implement a merchant group structure, and a commercial or comprehensive for-profit organization would implement a corporate structure.", "Then what about Valhalla?", "\u201cGiven Representative Seol\u2019s goals, a military structure would be the best fit\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah mentioned an idea. Seol Jihu felt slightly averse, but he did not show it externally. He already knew that Kim Hannah did not mean Valhalla should limit its members\u2019 freedom like an army, but should only bring and implement its structure.", "\u201cI get what you\u2019re saying. Now is the time to really do this.\u201d", "\u201cYes. Even if we recruit more members, we will only be getting stronger without a clear plan. An organization needs a working system to be united. Only then can new members quickly adapt to an unfamiliar environment and will have the necessary power to accept them.\u201d", "\u201cSo you\u2019re saying recruiting comes afterward.\u201d", "\u201cYes\u2026 or so I would like to say.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled bitterly.", "\u201cUnfortunately, we are short on time. It looks like we will have to simultaneously carry out internal restructuring and recruiting.\u201d", "Seol Jihu wanted to ask why, but then remembered an important upcoming event.", "\u201cThe March Neutral Zone.\u201d", "\u201cPrecisely. Come to think of it\u2014\u201d", "Kim Hannah asked as if she just remembered something as well.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had something you wanted to tell me regarding the March Neutral Zone?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, hold on just a sec.\u201d", "Seol Jihu rummaged through his pockets and took out a small notebook.", "\u2014Eun Yuri and Odelette Delphine prepared a final trump card.", "This was something Seol Jihu himself had said.", "He didn\u2019t know who this Eun Yuri was, but given that she survived until the final war and prepared a counterattack, she had to be someone extraordinary.", "\u201cI have her name\u2026\u201d", "He immediately wondered what he would answer if Kim Hannah asked how he got her name.", "\u2018I guess it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019", "But then he realized he could just make up a reason.", "Seol Jihu stopped worrying and asked.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Eun Yuri.\u201d", "\u201cEun Yuri?\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s tone went up like she heard an unexpected name.", "\u2018Wait.\u2019", "Seol Jihu thought Eun Yuri had yet to become an Earthling. This was because he did not see her name in Ian\u2019s records.", "Since his past-future self mentioned her, she should be a renowned expert. Since her name was not on the list, Seol Jihu had figured she had not entered Paradise yet.", "Seol Jihu took his eyes off of the notebook and looked forward.", "\u201cEun Yuri\u2026 It\u2019s been a while since I heard that name.\u201d", "Kim Hannah tilted her head with a look of surprise.", "\u201cYes, I know her. I know her very well.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "1. 'Kid' here isn't in the literal sense (at least, I don't think so). It's probably child as in disciple or member of his own organization (it's kinda vague though). "]}
