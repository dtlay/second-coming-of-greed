You\u2019re flattering me.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m saying it as it is. What you accomplished is something no one has done since the creation of the Seven Armies.

Jang Maldong tapped his cane on the floor before replying.", "\u201cThen how about two weeks?\u201d", "Chohong didn\u2019t say anything as if that was more acceptable, but Seol Jihu still seemed reluctant.", "\u201cEven two weeks is a bit long\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "\u201cFrom what Miss Kim Hannah told me, you haven\u2019t properly settled the problem of your background environment.
