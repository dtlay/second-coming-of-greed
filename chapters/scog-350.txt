Humanity does need to change.\u201d", "\u201cPerhaps the word \u2018revolution\u2019 would be more fitting. Some Earthlings might think the plan is too radical.

Personally, I\u2019ve always wondered about it.\u201d", "\u201cI see. I guess I don\u2019t have any choice. It\u2019s a bit of a long story. Are you okay with that?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded.", "Gabriel gave a deep sigh and licked her lips.", "\u201cWhere should I start\u2026.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, she continued.", "\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a great war. To put it simply, it was a war between the angels and the demons.\u201d", "Her voice was full of regret.", "Seol Jihu listened to the narrative silently.", "\u201cIt was a devastating war, where Authorities like the one the Parasite Queen used yesterday were ubiquitous.\u201d", "\u201cThe two sides fought fiercely for a long time. But in the end, the demons triumphed over the angels. The angels retreated to their sanctuary, their home \u2014 the Celestial Realm \u2014 and began plotting revenge. At the same time, the demons tried to invade the Celestial Realm in order to seal their victory. It was the beginning of a whole new war.\u201d", "\u201cWhat the angels came up with then was \u2014 summoning proxies. They had to protect the Celestial Realm no matter what, but they themselves lacked the power to do so. So they forcefully summoned proxies to fight for them.\u201d", "\u2018Proxies?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head curiously.", "The word \u2018forcefully\u2019 bothered him.", "\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d", "Suddenly, Gabriel turned to him and asked.", "\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve just been discharged from the army. You\u2019re so happy to finally go home and you fall asleep on the train. Then, when you open your eyes again, you\u2019re in a whole new world, against your will.\u201d", "Forced into a situation where there\u2019s no dream or hope, fighting against the demons as a proxy for the angels, unable to return home and barely surviving everyday\u2026.", "What would he think of the ones who put himself in such a situation?", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face unwittingly warped into a heavy frown.", "\u201cSon of a bitch\u2026.\u201d", "He immediately regretted saying it out loud, but the water had already spilled.", "But, he meant what he said.", "To be summoned forcefully on the day of his discharge\u2026 Seol Jihu felt sorry for that guy, whoever he was.", "\u201cSon of a bitch\u2026 yes, the angels must have been exactly that. From Martial God\u2019s perspective, that is.\u201d", "Gabriel didn\u2019t seem to mind Seol Jihu\u2019s harsh words.", "\u201cAnd those sons of bitches soon paid the price.\u201d", "\u201cPrice?\u201d", "\u201cYes. At one point, one proxy became ridiculously powerful. His power was enough to threaten not only the angels but also the demons.\u201d", "\u201cOoh.\u201d", "\u201cHey, you\u2026 nevermind. Anyway, that proxy quickly climbed to the top and began pursuing a vendetta against the angels and the demons. He and his followers first invaded Infernal Realm, the home of the demons, and then the Celestial Realm, the home of the angels.\u201d", "\u201cI see.\u201d", "\u201cFor the record, the Infernal Realm surrendered immediately without putting up a fight.\u201d", "Gabriel snorted.", "\u201cIt was pathetic, really. They begged him, \u2018Wasn\u2019t killing the Seven Archdemons and Fourteen Demon Lords enough? We\u2019re victims, too! Please spare our lives! We\u2019ll do anything! We can even become your dogs!\u2019 Well, the Martial God bought it, and he accepted their surrender under certain conditions.\u201d", "\u201cAnd the Celestial Realm?\u201d", "\u201cDestroyed.\u201d", "Gabriel answered simply.", "However, contrary to her tone, her face was grim.", "\u201cWe sent him a formal apology, and he replied by sending us a short letter and the head of the angel we\u2019d sent as a messenger. The letter said\u2026 What was it again? \u2018Demons, I can forgive. But you, never.\u2019 Something like that.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Martial God invaded the Celestial Realm. Using infernal flames and the infernal army, he destroyed everything and captured all angels. He even brought the angels who fell in battle back to life.\u201d", "Gabriel bit her lower lip.", "\u201cAnd then\u2026 The Martial God threw all the angels he captured into the Infernal Realm. He then ordered the demons to torment the angels with unimaginable pain and humiliation. He didn\u2019t want the demons to kill us. He wanted us to suffer forever. He told the demons that he would decide whether or not to accept their surrender, depending on how well they carry out his orders.\u201d", "\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d", "Gabriel answered curtly.", "\u201cThat\u2019s when hell began. After untold torture and humiliation, we angels fell from grace, and\u2026.\u201d", "Judging from her expression, it couldn\u2019t have been a thrilling experience. Gabriel continued hesitantly.", "\u201cWhat could we have done? We became slaves to the demons whom we despised so much, until one day we were given a chance.\u201d", "\u201cChance?\u201d", "\u201cParadise.\u201d", "Gabriel pointed at the sky, and then at the earth.", "\u201cYou see, there was actually an angel who turned over to the Martial God\u2019s side before all of this happened. I guess she took pity on us and begged the Martial God.\u201d", "\u201cTo forgive you?\u201d", "\u201cNot quite. She probably asked him to give us another chance. Well, they seemed like a happy couple, so I\u2019m guessing he couldn\u2019t ignore her request.\u201d", "A chance.", "Seol Jihu thought for a moment and then said.", "\u201cNo way.\u201d", "The corner of Gabriel\u2019s mouth slanted upward.", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Martial God robbed us of all our Authorities and power and then mentioned Paradise. He told us that the Parasite Queen was disturbing the peace of this planet and ordered us to take care of her. At least that\u2019s what he said. He probably just wanted us to suffer the same pain he did.\u201d", "Gabriel stopped moving.", "\u201cAnd so we came to this planet by force.\u201d", "She looked up at the stars in the night sky and shrugged her shoulders.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the end of my story. What do you think?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was speechless.", "In truth, he had hoped for a fairytale-like story in which a righteous alien race helped humans fight against the evil atrocities of the Parasite Queen.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "But the reality was far beyond his imagination.", "\u201cDon't feel sorry for us. Like I told you, we\u2019re just paying for what we\u2019ve done.\u201d", "Gabriel emphasized.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we Fallen Angels have no choice but to help Paradise. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to grab the chance given to us, even if it was the Martial God\u2019s empty words. I\u2019d rather bite off my tongue and kill myself than become the demons\u2019 slave again.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded slowly.", "\u201cI see. You\u2019re definitely on our side.\u201d", "\u201cYes. We\u2019re both fighting this war for the survival of our people, so you don\u2019t have to worry about betrayal. Earthlings are an exception\u2026 but maybe that\u2019ll change after tonight.\u201d", "Gabriel smacked her lips and shook her head, to indicate she didn\u2019t want to talk on this subject anymore.", "\u201cWell then.\u201d", "Gabriel cast a quick glance about the fortress and gave an enigmatic smile.", "\u201cNow that I\u2019ve satisfied your curiosity, I\u2019d like to go enjoy the festival\u2026.

He still wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted to say.", "\u201cSome races may want to express their gratitude in their own way. They don\u2019t mean any harm, that\u2019s just their culture. So don\u2019t think too badly of them.\u201d", "Gabriel left with the same enigmatic smile.", "Though clueless at first, Seol Jihu quickly came to a realization.", "He noticed a strange presence nearby.", "A number of foreign races were surrounding him.", "First he saw a group of beauties led by a Foxman with foxy eyes and a voluptuous figure. He then saw the little brats, including Haeryeo and Haeya. The group of white and yellow rice cakes was also joyfully wagging their tails at him.", "They were all waiting thirstily for a chance to talk to him.", "\u201cHello\u2026.\u201d", "The Foxman beauty was the first to speak.", "Blushing coyly, she approached him with a smile on her face.", "\u201cIf it's not too much trouble, could you come with us for a moment\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWait~ Hold on~\u201d", "It was then that pink-colored hair fluttered before Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes.", "Suddenly, Teresa came out of nowhere.

That means he\u2019s the king\u2019s son-in-law. And I\u2019m Haramark\u2019s only princess\u2026. Do you understand now?\u201d", "\u2018When did I become the king\u2019s son-in-law?\u2019", "Seol Jihu turned to Teresa with a puzzled look.", "The Foxman beauty seemed perplexed as well.", "\u201cA-And?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018and\u2019?

Sure, it starts out with just talking, but then one thing leads to another, and suddenly you\u2019re moaning under him.\u201d", "Teresa folded her arms.", "\u201cI respect your culture, and I\u2019d like for you to respect ours. Where he comes from, monogamy is the law. If you sleep with a woman who isn\u2019t your wife, you\u2019re criticized by your peers and even punishable by law. Surely you don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to the Federation\u2019s hero, do you?\u201d", "Teresa said all this very quickly, as if not to give her a chance to refute.", "Baffled, the Foxman beauty failed to find the right words and shut her mouth.", "\u201cTsk.\u201d", "Finally she clicked her tongue and turned around, and the rest of the beauty corps left with her in regret.", "\u201cHmph.\u201d", "Teresa watched them leave, her eyes full of contempt.

You heard me, right?\u201d", "She threw the little ones a gentle smile and waved them away with an impatient gesture.", "\u201cPooh!\u201d", "\u201cPink hag!\u201d", "Haeryeo, Haeya, and the rest of the little ones left sulking.", "\u201cKkiiing!\u201d", "The group of white rice cakes and yellow rice cakes also turned away with a grunt.", "\u201cThose brats.

Now Haramark will ally with the Fallen Angels.\u201d", "Teresa pulled Seol Jihu\u2019s hand and began to walk.", "\u201cPrincess?

Some then demanded humanity to leave Seol Jihu behind, and the situation almost turned into a fight. But in the end, everything worked out well and Seol Jihu was released and set out on his way to Eva.", "But there was one thing he left behind.", "He decided to place the Stele of Evaluation from the Pagoda of Dreams next to the World Tree.", "It was done, of course, with Roselle\u2019s consent.

She would become as quiet as she was now.", "In fact, today, Seol Jihu and several others tried striking up a conversation with her all during the trip, but Baek Haeju barely said a word back.", "Because of her seemingly cold demeanor, she was often seen alone than with a group of people.", "Although, she seemed perfectly content with her situation\u2026.", "\u2018Still, I\u2019m grateful to her.\u2019", "Seol Jihu concluded.", "He then hummed to himself as he took out the black belt he had received from Teresa.", "\u201cRamen is the best late-night snack.\u201d", "Ever since he suffered from hunger and thirst during the Delphinion Duchy Laboratory Escape, he had made a habit of stockpiling food.", "Belt infused with preservation magic was undoubtedly the best place to store food.", "\u201cLa la la, ramen, la la la la\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu hummed as he made a fire and took out ramen and bottled water.", "\u2018Water boils between 97\u00b0C and 99\u00b0C.
