After jumping over the rear wall, Seol Jihu knelt down and collected his breath.", "\u2018Damn, using it consecutively isn\u2019t easy.\u2019", "Even with his mana being at High (High), using a high-rank skill consecutively was taking a huge toll on his mana.", "Hoping that this meeting would be worth the trouble, Seol Jihu put down the attendant.", "\u201cWhich way is to the back garden?\u201d", "He asked while dusting off his clothes, but the attendant with disheveled hair didn\u2019t say anything and only covered her mouth with her hands.", "Then, when their eyes met, she shot up as though she was frightened out of her wits and then ran for her life. Seol Jihu\u2019s speed seemed to have scarred her for life.", "\u201c\u2026Was it that scary?\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head and started walking.", "Perhaps because the queen had taken appropriate measures, or because this was a private back garden, there wasn\u2019t anyone in sight.", "After a bit of walking, Seol Jihu arrived at a petite garden decorated with trees and flowers.", "Finding the queen wasn\u2019t difficult. A slender woman dressed in a white robe with long, faded-blonde hair was watering the flowers in front of a flower bed.", "It was Roe Scheherazade.", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "She turned around, perhaps having heard his footsteps. She put down the watering can and smiled brightly.", "\u201cYou came.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stopped about two meters in front of her.", "\u201cSorry for troubling you. I could have told you after the meeting, but it was a difficult situation\u2026\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade looked apologetic.", "It was indeed as she said. Things would have been easier if she had just asked to see him after the meeting. But Seol Jihu could guess why she chose to do things this way, judging by the way she asked him to come without anyone finding out.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he replied. \u201cI heard you wanted to meet me.\u201d", "\u201cYes! Your fame knows no bounds. In truth\u2026 I\u2019ve been wanting to see you for a long time. I\u2019ve heard all sorts of unbelievable stories from my surroundings.

When the video was being played in Scheherazade and Valhalla was searching Luxuria\u2019s temple\u2026 the Scheherazade Royal Family not only sent guards to hinder Valhalla, but it also sent an envoy to Eva.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade smiled bitterly.", "\u201cWhen I think about how you must have felt\u2026 I can only say that I am sorry. Though you may think I am being shameless, please allow me to explain.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade cleared her throat before continuing.", "\u201cI won\u2019t deny that I authorized it to happen. But I would like you to know that I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d", "Didn\u2019t have a choice. It sounded like Sinyoung forced her to do so against her will.", "\u2018Maybe that\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to tell me.\u2019", "He suspected as much ever since she said that she lost contact with the surrounding kingdoms.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. I\u2019m happy that our meeting today ended well. To be honest, I had forgotten about it until you reminded me.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke casually.", "\u201c\u2026You\u2019re generous.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade smiled sweetly before turning around.", "\u201cI\u2019m infinitely grateful\u2026 If it\u2019s alright, would you walk with me for a bit?\u201d", "She opened her hand and gestured toward the garden.", "Seol Jihu nodded.", "\u201cThis is a beautiful garden.\u201d", "\u201cThank you. I raised each flower with the utmost care and attention. I spend most of my time in this place, you see.\u201d", "\u201cIs gardening your hobby?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026 No. It\u2019s not like I hate it, but it\u2019s just that this is the only place where my heart can be at peace.\u201d", "Seol Jihu wanted to walk behind her, but Roe Scheherazade purposely slowed down so that they were side by side.", "They walked exchanging meaningless small talk when Roe Scheherazade suddenly asked.", "\u201cHow much do you know about this city, Representative Seol?\u201d", "It was a sudden, unexpected question.", "\u201cDo you know why Scheherazade became the capital of the Seven Kingdoms?\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade asked another question as Seol Jihu racked his brains to figure out the intent of her question.", "\u201cBecause it\u2019s at the center of the other six cities\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade smiled softly.", "\u201cBut to be more precise, it\u2019s not that Scheherazade is at the center of the other six cities. But the other six cities form a final line of defense around Scheherazade.\u201d", "\u201cFinal line of defense?\u201d", "\u201cYes. To the six cities, Scheherazade serves as the final bastion.\u201d", "In other words, there was something more to Scheherazade other than its favorable location that made it special.", "\u201cRepresentative Seol, have you heard of Gorad Boga?\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows at the sudden mention of the word.", "He certainly knew the word. But when the bishop was going on about the supposed divine land, he only pretended to believe him and scoffed on the inside.", "After all, the place he was describing was equivalent to the legendary, mythical places of Earth that were only talked about in literature.", "\u201cI heard one of Gorad Boga\u2019s special traits is an incredible amount of vital energy diffused in its surroundings.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was indirectly saying how Scheherazade didn\u2019t have vital energy in its atmosphere.", "\u201cNot at all. Distinguishing Gorad Boga with the existence of vital energy is strictly a personal judgment, and it is a wrong interpretation.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade slowly shook her head.", "\u201cGorad Boga, the City of God, is the place that was ruled by the world\u2019s first god after their birth. Any land with a trace of this god\u2019s rule can become Gorad Boga.\u201d", "She spoke kindly like a teacher instructing her student.", "\u201cMy ancestor discovered this trace and built a new city around the ruin. That city is Scheherazade.\u201d", "Seol Jihu only half-believed her.", "He wasn\u2019t the type to believe in a legend without proof, but he also didn\u2019t believe that a queen would lie at a time like this. He just couldn\u2019t see why she would trick him at this point.", "\u201cYou mean the ruin is inside this city?\u201d", "\u201cYes, precisely.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade nodded her head.", "\u201cA grand magic, the purpose of which is to protect the city of god, is hidden in Scheherazade.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu stared at her blankly, the calmly explaining Roe Scheherazade blinked rapidly and waved her hand.", "\u201cAh, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s anything amazing. Although it has the power of a god, our enemy is also a god.

I didn\u2019t think I asked for anything difficult.]", "[It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t, but I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t create the situation you wanted nor did I have the power to do so.]", "He remembered the talk Black Seol Jihu had with Yun Seohui during the defense of Scheherazade.

Can you tell me?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t see why not\u2026 But Scheherazade being Gorad Boga is actually a secret that only a few people know.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade giggled.", "\u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll tell you and even show you the ruin if you want. In exchange, Representative Seol has to answer just one question honestly.\u201d", "It was nothing difficult.", "\u201cSure. What do you want to know?\u201d", "Judging that it wasn\u2019t a bad trade, Seol Jihu agreed. Meanwhile, he racked his brain trying to figure out why Roe Scheherazade called him here and just what it was that she wanted to ask.", "\u2018Is she trying to show this city\u2019s value?

Such resentment\u2026 How can a living person have so much resentment?]", "Even Flone, who was inside the pendant, was flustered.", "\u2018Oh yeah.\u2019", "Thinking about it now, the energy Roe Scheherazade was giving off was similar to the energy that was emitted by Flone, who became a vengeful spirit from hundreds of years of resentment.", "\u2018But why?\u2019", "Seol Jihu felt he shouldn\u2019t answer this question thoughtlessly. That said, the case was closed.", "Feeling rather uncomfortable, Seol Jihu glanced to the side.", "Roe Scheherazade was looking straight ahead, quietly.", "He wasn\u2019t mistaken. Roe Scheherazade, whom he felt would break like a twig, suddenly changed.", "He could sense a bitter hatred from her pure, graceful face. This contradicting duality reminded him of Yun Seohui.", "Could it be that she was Yun Seohui? Was she disguised as Roe Scheherazade to try to figure out his intentions?", "This was a plausible suspicion as Seol Jihu had been thinking that the meeting concluded too easily.", "And so, Seol Jihu activated the Future-Gauging Nine Eyes.
