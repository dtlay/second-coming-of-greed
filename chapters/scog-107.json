It also had several peaks piercing through the clouds to the skies.", "\u201cHuk, huk! Huk, huk!\u201d", "Furthermore, the word \u2018rough\u2019 didn\u2019t begin to describe its roads. The mountain\u2019s wildly curved ridges were full of sharply protruding rocks that caused more than a few difficulties when running.", "\u201cUuaaaaah!\u201d", "Not even five minutes had passed since Seol Jihu started running, but he was already screaming as his feet kicked off the rugged ground. The slope toward the mountain peak wasn\u2019t any different. If anything, the added steepness only made it worse, greatly exacerbating the burden placed on his thighs and calves.", "\u2018This isn\u2019t running\u2026!\u2019", "It was practically impossible to rein in curse words, but he was too busy gasping for breath to let them escape his mouth. Just moving one leg forward took two seconds. It was more fitting to say that he was climbing the mountain rather than running on it.", "That wasn\u2019t all. Since he didn\u2019t know when a monster or a wild beast would pop out of the woods, he had to stay mentally alert at all times\u2026.", "\u201c!\u201d", "Did he lose his focus for a moment? Just as he was about to reach the mountain peak, he lost his footing and slipped.", "\u201cAaaah!\u201d", "The hands he threw out to balance himself grabbed onto a rock. He pulled himself up to the peak clutching this rock like a straw, and then he finally heaved out the breath he\u2019d been holding back.", "It was so miserably dreadful and tiring. He was panting rapidly as if he was on the verge of taking his last breath. When he turned around with his raspy breathing, his gaze pierced through the foggy clouds around him and landed on the starting point in the distance.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face contorted. He bit his lower lip hard enough to leave a clear mark, then started to make his way down.", "People who rock-climbed for fun all said the same thing - that the descent was far more exhausting than the ascent. In other words, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t ease up on his run just because he was going downhill.", "Because of the steepness of the slope, he accelerated naturally. Speeding down a rugged terrain was no different than committing suicide. One would normally have to control themselves so as to not gain too much speed, but the current Seol Jihu found it extremely difficult to do this.", "\u201cKeeeu!\u201d", "Each time he stepped on the ground and forcefully suppressed his momentum, his feet felt like they were on fire. Because there were too many things going on at once, he lost his focus and fell forward from the burden on his body.", "Thankfully, he was able to get back up without major injuries, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about his trembling legs.", "Seol Jihu fell down and rolled on the ground several more times before he finally made it back to the starting point. By this point, he was half delirious. However, Jang Maldong only watched him silently, and Seol Jihu had to turn around as if a powerful pressure pushed him forward.", "Once, twice, thrice\u2026. The more trips he made back and forth, the more injuries he got on his body. Sweat oozed out from every pore in his body, and his heart pounded as if it would burst out at any moment.", "He was at his limit.", "\u2018No.\u2019", "For some reason, he felt something was off with this training. However, Jang Maldong spoke clearly, like a judge passing down a punishment to the accused.", "\u201cForty-five remaining.\u201d", "Instantly, Seol Jihu felt his legs go limp. Was this what it felt like to be a criminal sentenced to death? He had already suffered so much just to complete five trips, yet he had to make forty-five more?", "He wasn\u2019t even half-way done, but despair began to set in. That was how painful and brutal this training was.", "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you running? What, you\u2019re quitting already?\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu hesitate, a fiery order descended.", "\u201cDon\u2019t rest.

Seol Jihu gritted his teeth and kicked off the ground.", "In the end, he ran for the entire day before managing to complete the fifty trips. When he came back to the cave, it was already dawn. Although dinner was prepared for him, he collapsed before the thought of eating even brushed his mind.", "Chwaaa! Suddenly, cold water fell on his face.

His training load had more than doubled in a single day. Seol Jihu covered his mouth and let out a pained moan.", "*", "A day went by, then another. On the third day, heavy rain poured down.", "However, the training continued without a hitch.

You should at least let him eat nutritious\u2014\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about breakfast, I already gave it to him.\u201d", "Jang Maldong muttered as he chewed on vegetables he harvested in the mountain.

It\u2019s not like you, Master Jang.\u201d", "It was a rare sight seeing Agnes so worried. However, she couldn\u2019t be blamed as Seol Jihu\u2019s condition was racing toward the absolute worst.", "His bright eyes had turned lifeless and the smile had disappeared from his face. The way he tottered around, it really looked like he was a dead man walking.", "\u201cI have no other choice.\u201d", "Jang Maldong replied calmly.", "\u201cI think he realizes it himself, but he\u2019s currently twisted completely. His mind, technique, and body. All of it.\u201d", "Kazuki and Hugo looked as if they couldn\u2019t understand.

His talent is exceedingly average, but his mind is incomprehensibly chaotic; his technique seems to be high level, but he can\u2019t use it properly; it\u2019s the same with his body - he has powerful hidden strength, but his physical body can\u2019t handle it.\u201d", "Jang Maldong fully understood Seol Jihu\u2019s dilemma. Comparing him to a geometric shape, he was like a strange polygon with one or two vertices shooting out abnormally.", "When Jang Maldong first saw him, he thought, \u2018What the heck is he?\u2019 And he didn\u2019t have the slightest idea how to go about fixing him.", "\u201cBefore we discuss the disharmony in these three elements, we have to correct the parts that are warped out of shape\u2026.\u201d", "If the young man continued to grow like this, it would be irreversible.

If he had chosen the path of the Magician, he might have even reached the Unique Rank.\u201d", "\u2018That much?\u2019", "A hint of disbelief emerged on Agnes\u2019s face. Jang Maldong was implying he would eventually reach a limit, but that this limit would have an abnormally high ceiling.", "Agnes knew how special the young man\u2019s Status Window was ever since she was in the Neutral Zone. But the word \u2018Unique Rank\u2019 wasn\u2019t one that could be thrown around so easily.", "\u201cThe second method is to suppress the growth of his technique to the limit while he improves his mind and body until the three elements are even.\u201d", "\u201cYou mean to correct him by balancing his mind, technique, and body.\u201d", "\u201cIt will take time, but this is the surest way of going about this.\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu refused this.", "There was only one method remaining, and that was to combine the first method and the second. More precisely, it was to not limit the technique\u2019s growth, bring up the mind and the body to the same level of the technique, and fix the warped parts of the three elements. All of this had to be done in harmony.", "Since there were more than two things that needed to be done simultaneously, it was only obvious for the difficulty to skyrocket.", "\u2018Would I be able to do it?\u2019 Agnes thought for a moment before shaking her head.", "\u201cThere is a limit to one\u2019s willpower. That is not something a \u2018human\u2019 is capable of.\u201d", "\u201cI concur.\u201d", "Jang Maldong also agreed. The final method couldn\u2019t just be described as \u2018difficult\u2019. One truly needed willpower transcending the human realm to be able to even attempt it.", "\u201cSo he needs to come to terms with it himself.\u201d", "Hearing this, Agnes finally realized why Jang Maldong was making Seol Jihu repeat such a crazy training regime. It was to tell the young man that if he didn\u2019t stop now, things would get much harder in the future.", "\u201cIn any case, this is quite a surprise. I didn\u2019t expect you, Miss Agnes, to worry about him so much.\u201d", "\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d", "When Jang Maldong brought up this topic, Agnes told him that she taught Seol Jihu back in the Neutral Zone. Jang Maldong put on a surprised look.", "\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened\u2026. Did he handle your training well?\u201d", "\u201cHe completed it outstandingly.\u201d", "\u201cI see\u2026. Well, you wouldn\u2019t be here if he didn\u2019t, fufu.\u201d", "Jang Maldong laughed and got up as if he finally understood.", "\u201cI was thinking he was lasting well. It makes sense if he trained under the infamous Demonic Instructor. Thank you for the good info.\u201d", "Jang Maldong grinned.", "*", "Fourth day.", "The rain stopped. As if the previous day\u2019s downpour was a lie, scorching sunlight beat down.", "The training changed too. The intensity went up, and a new drill was added.", "The training started out the same way as always - performing thirty thousand spear techniques in the air. As soon as this ended, Jang Maldong made Seol Jihu wear all twelve sandbags, and today, he said he would change the running course.", "He said to make the mountain peaks on the left and right side as half-way points. In other words, rather than going back and forth in a straight line, Seol Jihu now had to run in a zigzag.", "As he was finally getting used to the straight path, this change struck him like a bolt of lightning from the clear sky.", "That wasn't all. Every time he completed ten trips, he was made to perform the Thrust, Strike, and Cut a thousand-times each. What pained him the most was that Jang Maldong began to actively intervene in the training.", "He didn\u2019t give Seol Jihu even the slightest break between each drill. In just ten or so minutes, Seol Jihu had to complete three sets of burpees and kettlebell swings.", "And when he was about to collapse at the end of it all\u2026.", "Tak, tak, tak, tak!", "\u201cWho told you to faint? Get up!\u201d", "\u201cAak\u2026. Aak\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong brutally swung his cane.", "In the end, Seol Jihu had to grit his teeth and turn his steps to the mountain peak.", "*", "Fifth day.", "Jang Maldong wasn\u2019t always with him when he was training. There were times when he left to see how the others were doing, but that didn\u2019t mean no one was watching Seol Jihu.", "Today, Kazuki came as a replacement.", "After Seol Jihu completed his thirtieth trip and was repeating the Thrust, Strike, and Cut\u2026.", "\u201cWuuuuek!\u201d", "Vomit suddenly poured out of his mouth. His stomach had been unable to digest the lunch he had forced inside.", "However, he only faltered for a moment. He immediately went back to performing the Thrust, not caring to even wipe his mouth.", "\u201c\u2026You shouldn\u2019t overdo it.\u201d Kazuki was silently watching him until now, but he finally opened his mouth.", "\u201cNo one has ever seen the end of the Banquet on their first time.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say anything. Kazuki could tell he was listening from the way he glanced his way once, but the young man didn\u2019t open his mouth. It couldn\u2019t be helped since the current Seol Jihu was pushed to the point where every single breath was precious.", "\u201cYou\u2019re still a Level 3. You can try again two years later when you\u2019re Level 4 or higher.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face contorted. Sometimes, the kind sister-in-law\u2019s concern seemed more annoying than the nagging mother-in-law. He was already exhausted and on the verge of breaking down, so he was angered by Kazuki\u2019s meddling words.", "\u201cIf it is because of Master Jang, you don\u2019t have to worry. He is waiting for you to realize it yourself. Sure, he might yell at you, but since you\u2019ve come this far\u2026.\u201d", "Swish! The end of the Seol Jihu\u2019s spear suddenly headed towards Kazuki.

I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do in my current state.\u201d", "Seol Jihu pulled his Ice Spear back as he glared at Kazuki with his dim eyes.

I know what you mean, so shut up!\u201d", "Seol Jihu growled. He was pushed to the corner and didn\u2019t have the peace of mind to behave normally.", "\u201cI don\u2019t understand.

I\u2019ll use it, but\u2026!\u201d", "PANG! PANG!", "His Strike and Cut began to carry the same shockwaves as his Thrust.

That it was his fate to come to Paradise.", "He couldn\u2019t be blamed. He had a Gold Mark and two Innate Abilities, neither of which anyone else seemed to have.

Because he always put himself in missions exceeding his capabilities, he almost lost his life multiple times.", "He survived pitifully and desperately. He was nothing like what the protagonist would look like.", "It was the same for getting stronger. The protagonists from novels got stronger easily by finding treasures and having fortuitous encounters.", "But he wasn\u2019t like that. His talent was exceedingly average, and although he was giving it his all, he wasn\u2019t seeing much progress.", "And now, even the abilities that made him special were beginning to strangle him.

When he was hungry at first, all sorts of food bounced around in his head. Then, he suddenly thought of the refreshing taste of Coke but ultimately desired water.", "To be more precise, his body began to crave water. His brain, his head, his organs\u2026 every cell in his body searched for it.", "It was the same with training.", "At first, he was approached by all sorts of temptations: to take a break, to rest when no one is watching, or to take a sip of water and smoke a cigarette.", "The temptation would tell him, \u2018Why don\u2019t you take it easy?\u2019", "But once he passed this phase, he became reluctant to give in. Even if he wanted to take it easy, he gave it his all because he didn\u2019t want to waste everything he\u2019d endeavored before.", "From that point on, no thoughts entered his mind, and his body moved on its own.", "But just like Agnes said, even the strongest willpower had its limit.", "A silent night.

In gaming terms, it was as if he defeated a boss that couldn\u2019t be killed by dealing damage to it.

Crazy brat!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Neutral Zone\u2026.\u201d", "It seemed he hadn\u2019t fainted yet as mumblings came out along with his panting.", "\u201cI became blind\u2026 without any preparation\u2026 skeletons\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cAlmost died\u2026 so\u2026 I vowed\u2026.\u201d", "Words that were hard to understand came out of his mouth.", "\u201c\u2026I see your determination.\u201d", "With a short sigh, Jang Maldong threw what was in his hand. Tk. A fist-sized pouch landed next to him.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Competence.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes shone. There was Competence among the village head\u2019s medicine? No, Paradise had Competence?", "\u201cCompetence\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be surprised about? Most items in the Neutral Zone were made in Paradise.\u201d", "Now that he thought about it, it really was like that. Psychi\u2019s Tears was something a Paradisian concocted as well.", "\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see it here either. After all, its brewing method disappeared when the Empire fell.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cBecause of its rarity, it should fetch a nice price\u2026. Do you want to sell it?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head vehemently. Why would he sell it when he desperately wanted them? Jang Maldong opened his mouth as if he predicted as much.", "\u201cThen starting from today, drink one bottle before you start your training. The quality of training will go up starting tomorrow. You might be able to pull it off if you drink that Competence.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu opened the pouch and saw bottles filled with milky liquid, his head shot up.", "\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d", "\u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d", "Jang Maldong grumbled with a somewhat solemn voice.", "\u201cWhat matters is that you lasted another day. I\u2019ll pack my bags the moment I see you slacking, got that?\u201d", "Jang Maldong turned around. He paused his steps before he went back into the cave and spoke with a softened expression.", "\u201c\u2026Rest. It will only get harder from tomorrow.\u201d", "No, perhaps it was more appropriate to describe his expression as \u2018I lost\u2019. If Ian knew, he would most certainly fall backward in shock. After all, the young man had defeated the old man who was known for his stubbornness.", "\u201cGo take a shower too before you come back. You smell horrific.\u201d", "Hmph. With a snort, Jang Maldong slowly disappeared into the cave.", "Seol Jihu remained collapsed on the ground for a while before he staggered up. When he held the pouch in his hand, his exhausted expression became dazed. He had been too out of it to notice before, but a few message windows were hovering in the air.", "[Trait \u2018Tenacity\u2019 has been created.][Trait \u2018Patience\u2019 has evolved to \u2018Self-command\u2019.][Your Stamina stat increased from \u2018Low (High)\u2019 to \u2018Intermediate (Low)\u2019.]", "He\u2019d done it. Having the second part of the stat change wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do. Not only did it require more points to increase them artificially, but there was also a huge difference between Low and Intermediate.", "What mattered was that Seol Jihu didn\u2019t use points to level it up. Unless one was an athlete who trained regularly, the Strength and Stamina stats were extremely difficult to breakthrough by training. However, Seol Jihu managed to succeed.", "\u2018It didn\u2019t increase for the longest time.\u2019", "That was to be expected. Although Seol Jihu never skipped out on training until now, he had never pushed himself to his absolute limit. That was why his stats were maintaining their current rank without going up.", "But the harsh training he endured in the past week had combined with what he had built up until now, resulting in this increase in Stamina. Once he let his body recover, he would be able to feel the difference.", "Seol Jihu got up with a lighthearted face. He couldn\u2019t help but feel ecstatic. During the past seven days, he had to constantly fight himself without rest.", "Of course, as a former gambling addict, this wasn\u2019t the first time he fought with himself. However, he had only lost until now.", "But today\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026Hehe.\u201d", "He had acquired his first victory. So how could he not be happy?"]}
