I\u2019m sure you know better than anyone that there are a lot of perverts among their executives. Disgusting bastards who fulfill the perverse desires that they are unable to show on Earth, in Paradise.\u201d", "\u201cYes, well, you have accurately described their former representative. So what exactly did you hear?\u201d", "\u201cWas it at a bar? One of the executives bragged that you had to go to the restroom, but he made you go in front of him. It was disgusting. Even I can\u2019t get it up looking at someone else\u2019s shit\u2026. Ugh, just thinking about it again makes me sick.\u201d", "Abhorrent Charity covered his face with his tentacles, clearly disgusted.", "\u201cDid that really happen? He\u2019s lying, right?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026So they\u2019re telling that story like it\u2019s some sort of heroic tale. I expected as much.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade replied without batting an eye.", "\u201cDo you want me to bring you that son of a bitch? You\u2019ve done a lot for us, so I\u2019ll give you a chance to do the same to him.\u201d", "\u201cI appreciate your offer, but I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t enjoy watching someone defecate like some kind of an animal.\u201d", "\u201cShit.

Once the mana reaches the magic circle on the ceiling, we\u2019ll be able to activate phase two.\u201d", "\u201cPhase one changes the structure of the ruin to draw mana from all over the city\u2026. So it\u2019s essentially a preparatory step for phase two.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. Once the mana is fully charged, we\u2019ll be able to activate a large, powerful barrier that covers the entire city.\u201d", "\u201cA barrier triggered by such an enormous magic circle\u2026. The center of the circle is that source over there. Even if the barrier is damaged, it can be repaired as long as the source is intact, and even if the mana is depleted, once recharged, the barrier can be used repeatedly\u2026. Hoh? This barrier can turn a small amount of external force into mana and use it to repair itself? Indeed, this magic circle is much too advanced for humans to make!\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade smiled at the hooded monster muttering to himself.", "The Third Army Commander of the Parasites was called the Necromancer, but before that, he was an Archlich, and much before that a revered grand magician and sage.", "Perhaps that was why he was able to recognize Gorad Boga\u2019s true nature from the limited information given.", "\u201cThis barrier would\u2019ve lasted for dozens of days even against all seven of us. That is, assuming the enemy provided the magic circle a steady supply of mana, of course. This could have been troublesome to get rid of. I thank you for your cooperation.\u201d", "Abhorrent Charity bowed lightly at the queen.", "Roe Scheherazade gave a mystical smile.", "\u201cHow come you\u2019re more human than\u2026.

It would be best if I could take it with me\u2026.\u201d", "A limp tentacle stretched out of Abhorrent Charity\u2019s sleeve and stroked his chin.", "\u201cBut the source itself is a powerful barrier\u2026. It will take at least a month of working together for Twisted Kindness and me to be able to put our hands in\u2026.\u201d", "Huhuhu. Low laughter escaped the hood.", "\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry.

On top of that, he could feel his remaining mana slowly draining out of his body.", "And he had already used a special Thunder that he had only a few from the beginning. Now the choice of a prolonged war was basically gone.", "\u2018What should I do?\u2019", "Originally, he had planned to enter Gorad Boga no matter what, alone if necessary, but now he was unable to move because of the two Army Commanders in front of him.", "Seol Jihu glanced around quickly, chewing on his lips.", "It seemed that all the trapped Earthlings were able to escape because there was no one nearby.", "The only comrade he had was Flone, whose face was hardened with anxiety, and Yun Seohui in Flone\u2019s arms.", "He knew that running away wasn\u2019t a good choice.", "The enemy\u2019s goal was to capture Scheherazade.", "But there wasn\u2019t much time for hesitation.", "He was becoming more and more disadvantaged over time.", "If another Army Commander appeared now, Seol Jihu would surely die.", "It would be best to wait for his comrades to arrive before trying anything.", "Finally, Seol Jihu decided to retreat before it was too late.", "\u201cFlone!\u201d", "[Yeah!]", "Flone quickly soared to the sky with Yun Seohui in her arms.", "Seol Jihu also rose to the air using Ethereal Shift continuously.", "\u201cI won\u2019t let you escape!\u201d", "Exploding Patience hurried after them, but stopped in astonishment when Seol Jihu pulled a handful of blue stones out of his pocket and threw them at her.", "It wasn\u2019t just one.

I wanted to see it with my own eyes at least once.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun replied simply, then clicked his tongue as he looked around.", "\u201cBut\u2026 I quit halfway through. I was getting bored, and I felt like something might have happened here.\u201d", "He said as he watched Vulgar Chastity slowly pull herself up from the ground.", "Then Sung Shihyun shook his head and spoke with a sigh.", "\u201cWell, I commend you for letting him escape at the right time.
