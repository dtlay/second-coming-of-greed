{"cid": "193", "title": "Chapter 193. High Ranker (1)", "content": ["The sound of someone loudly stomping up the stairs rang out. Following that, the metal door crashed open to reveal a person huffing behind it.", "It was none other than Phi Sora who was fuming hot air from her nostrils like a mad bull. Jang Maldong shouted at her with a displeased face.", "\u201cWill it kill you to gently open the door? My ears almost fell off!\u201d", "However, Phi Sora did not respond in the slightest.", "No.", "Rather than worrying about Jang Maldong, Phi Sora was glaring at Seol Jihu like an enraged bull watching the matador waving a red cloth in front of it.", "And the moment Seol Jihu realized what was going on, Phi Sora\u2019s jaws stretched open.", "\"Kwuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\"", "It was a monster\u2019s roar birthed by endless indignancy and rage.", "\"W-What\u2019s going on? Why is that brat like this all of a sudden?\u201d", "It didn\u2019t matter whether Jang Maldong found it absurd or not. Phi Sora let loose the rage she had amassed from suffering several nights without sleep.", "\"Gyaaaak!\"", "And as she charged over with both her arms raised, threatening to pull out all of his hair\u2026", "\"Wait!\"", "Seol Jihu shot up from his seat and firmly pressed his palm forward.", "At the sudden action filled with bravado, Phi Sora stopped her charge just as she was about to pounce on him.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "It took her only a moment to look at the shopping bag swaying from his hand.", "\"Hah.\"", "She snorted, and her flaming eyes bent into crescent moons.", "\"You\u2019re planning to call it even with just this?\u201d", "Her tone was boiling hot, like that of a blazing furnace.", "\"I bought Master something else, but besides him, I bought the same thing for everyone. It\u2019s nothing big. Just something I bought while I was out.\u201d", "The sound of Jang Maldong dryly coughing in the back could be heard.Of course, Phi Sora did not hear it.", "\"So what you\u2019re saying is, I should just take this and quietly fuck off.\u201d", "She cracked her neck left and right and curled up one side of her lip in a sneer. Her eyes weren\u2019t smiling at all, making her look extra frightening.", "From the looks of it, it didn\u2019t seem like she had any intention of receiving the gift, so Seol Jihu carefully put down the present.Then, he tilted his head and asked.", "\"Are you going to hit me?\"", "\"Yes, I\u2019m going to fucking hit you.\"", "As Phi Sora threateningly widened her eyes, Seol Jihu calmly shook his head.", "\"Don\u2019t be like that. Why are you trying to hit people?\u201d", "\"This fucking bastard. It wouldn\u2019t have been enough even if you had gone down on your knees to apologize, but what? Cheeky as hell, really!\u201d", "As if she was getting more triggered after seeing Seol Jihu boldly attempt to persuade her, a string of colorful cuss words poured out of Phi Sora\u2019s mouth.", "\u201cSure, I can laugh over Phi-za or Phi-colo. But what? Phi-diot?\u201d", "\"Phi! Diot!\u201d", "\"This son of a bitch\u2014\"", "As if she was unable to bear saying anything more, Phi Sora\u2019s eyes flipped. Seol Jihu plopped down on the couch, then shrugged his shoulders and raised both of his hands.", "\"Well, do whatever you want. I\u2019ll just stay still here.\u201d", "\"Oh? Okay! I will do whatever I want. You thought I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d", "Seol Jihu leisurely glanced up and down Phi Sora\u2019s body with carefree eyes. Then, he smirked.", "\"That equipment, it really suits you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d", "Phi Sora who had been cracking her fingers abruptly stopped moving. After confirming the opponent\u2019s reaction, Seol Jihu\u2019s tongue began to dance.", "\"A long sword, a shield, an armor, and even boots\u2026 Aiyaa. I don\u2019t know who gave them to you, but they sure are marvelous. Marvelous indeed!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\"It must be because they\u2019re from the Banquet. Don\u2019t they look gorgeous? You think so too, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu leaned his chin on the back of his hand and grinned. With her teeth tightly clenched, Phi Sora\u2019s neck began to visibly tremble.", "\"Ah! Now that I think about it, the war is over so\u2014\u201d", "\"Y-You shameless bastard!\u201d", "Phi Sora couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and began to shake in indignation.", "\"What do you mean shameless? It\u2019s in the contract. Did you forget that the equipment was rented to you only until the end of the war?\u201d", "He wasn\u2019t wrong, but the situation was. The reason he suddenly brought up her equipment\u2014 Phi Sora wasn\u2019t stupid enough to not know what he meant.", "She could just kick away the present he brought from Earth, but it was a completely different story when it concerned items in Paradise. After all, it wasn\u2019t easy to find equipment with such quality and performance.", "She could just return them and request for funds to purchase new equipment, but even that decision was up to Seol Jihu.", "\"Keuk\u2026\"", "The sound of violent gnashing of teeth was heard.", "\u201cI mean, you only need to get hit a couple of times. Do you really have to be like this?\"", "\"What do you mean? Are you saying I can\u2019t ask for that equipment as the rightful owner?\u201d", "\"So childish, really. How does a person get so rotten?\u201d", "\"Who exactly tricked whom first?\u201d", "Phi Sora made a face of disbelief.", "He was still holding that grudge? No matter how many times she screamed how old he was and that he was being childish, Seol Jihu\u2019s response remained the same.", "Phi Sora felt like she would explode if she continued this conversation. After staring at the childish Seol Jihu for a while, she widened her eyes and growled as if she was going to eat him alive.", "\"Fuck! From now on, this equipment is mine. Don\u2019t even think about taking it back. Okay?\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed like an old man.", "\"Miss Phi Sora, does thou conscience\u2026 exist?\u201d", "\"No, it doesn\u2019t!\"", "After yelling that, Phi Sora swung around so fast that cold air blew. And not forgetting to snatch the shopping bag, she stomped out.", "\"Fuck!\"", "And while storming out, she stopped to stamp down hard on the ground. Just how indignant was she?", "Looking at Phi Sora stomping into her room, Seol Jihu giggled while holding his belly. And when the thud of a door slamming shut rang out\u2014", "\"\u2026Since when did you two get so close?\u201d", "Jang Maldong asked with a blank face.", "People that didn\u2019t know them would ask just what was friendly about the situation, but as someone who knew Phi Sora very well, Jang Maldong was surprised beyond belief.", "If Phi Sora who hated being teased about her name the most repressed her temper, it meant at the very least that she viewed Seol Jihu as an ally.", "\"We\u2019re not really friends yet. We just bicker whenever we see each other.\u201d", "Jang Maldong let out an empty laugh hearing him say it wasn\u2019t anything big. Then after letting out a sigh of relief, he got up from his seat shaking his head.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s laughter stopped.", "\"Where are you going?\"", "\"I\u2019m going out for a bit.\"", "\"What about our talk\u2026.\"", "\"We\u2019ll continue that once you become a High Ranker.\u201d", "Jang Maldong grinned.", "\u201cTrue or False, a High Ranker is a High Ranker. As a leader, raising your level would raise your team\u2019s outward appearance, will it not?\"", "With that, Jang Maldong took out a plate the size of a palm and placed it on the table.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s gaze naturally followed down with it. The geometric patterns covering it emitted a golden light that made it look impressive.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\"", "\"It\u2019s a tablet of certification from King Prihi. He dropped by the office personally to give it.\u201d", "\"A tablet of certification?\"", "\"This punk. Strictly speaking, becoming a High Ranker should be viewed as a job advancement or a promotion. Don\u2019t you know that the royal families are involved in the evaluation of such promotions?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face became dazed as he finally remembered the fact.", "\u201cHe said that you\u2019ve already proven yourself to be more than certified, so you don\u2019t need any other test.\u201d", "\"Then again, if he tried to assign you a difficult mission disguised under all sorts of excuses, I was prepared to move our base.\u201d", "Seol Jihu carefully held the tablet.", "\"I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d", "He looked like he would beg him to talk again as soon as he came back, so Jang Maldong hurriedly took out a record book from his clothes.", "\"It\u2019s a record book we found while sorting out Ian\u2019s belongings. You know that Ian was responsible for keeping records, right?\u201d", "Hearing him mention Ian, Seol Jihu immediately became solemn.", "\"I have something I personally want to hear from you.\u201d", "\"?\"", "\"Talking with you today made me see that you\u2019ve only been focusing on your own personal growth.\u201d", "Jang Maldong continued.", "\u201cHowever, there\u2019s a limit to what you can accomplish by yourself.\u201d", "Seol Jihu unconsciously expressed agreement.", "If he had been alone during the war, he would have never been able to win no matter how many times he died and revived.", "\"The vision you\u2019re drawing for the upcoming future beyond your personal goals.\u201d", "Jang Maldong paused and pulled down his fedora lower.", "\"I\u2019m curious about that.\"", "Looking at Seol Jihu\u2019s clueless face, Jang Maldong chuckled.", "\"If you don\u2019t know what I mean, I\u2019d like you to take a day and slowly read through that record book. It\u2019ll probably help.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tightly held the record book.", "Immediately after the conversation was over, Seol Jihu dashed straight towards the temple of Gula.", "There were a lot of things to think about, but he felt like becoming a High Ranker should be his first step.", "Of course, just raising his level didn\u2019t mean that he would gain the abilities of a High Ranker, but like Jang Maldong said, it would be useful for showing off.", "And truthfully, he desired to be a High Ranker himself too.", "\"Hmm\u2026.\"", "Seol Jihu stopped his steps in front of the temple and searched for something inside his pockets.", "[Divine Stigmata]\u2014A special stigma among the many created for the human body. Contains a trace of divinity.\n\u2014You will be immediately sent to a trial location the moment you present it as an offering.\n\u2014If you can withstand the trials given by the god you serve, you will be given power on par with a Saint.\n\u2014Although it will be an extremely painful and difficult trial, the Stigma created in the process is sure to return as a strong power.", "'Is it right to use it now?\u2019", "After reading the description and putting it away, Seol Jihu entered the temple. Interestingly, he couldn\u2019t see a single person at the temple today.", "Seol Jihu immediately stopped his steps and bowed his head when the statue came into view.", "A still silence followed. Seol Jihu stood still without moving a muscle for a while. The reason he didn\u2019t speak was that he felt the sensation of Gula placing her hand on his head the moment he bowed.", "'Mmmm\u2026.'", "Seol Jihu relished the sensation of the goddess\u2019 soft hand, which he hadn\u2019t felt for a long time.", "Gula also didn\u2019t say anything and continued to stroke his head.", "How much time passed by?", "[Looks like the time has come.]", "A relaxed voice rang in his ears.", "'Time?'", "[Our decision of accepting Earthlings was probably one close to that of gambling.]", "Hearing her suddenly jump to the main subject, Seol Jihu who had been drowned in a hazy feeling immediately came to his senses.", "[But there was no other choice than to do so.]", "Gula waited for Seol Jihu to be ready to listen and started speaking after clearing her voice.", "[It was because the situation was hopeless. Do you know what the Parasite Queen did the moment she gained control of the \u2018Middle World\u2019?]", "'I heard she destroyed the Empire.\u2019", "[Yes.]", "Gula quietly affirmed.", "[The Empire was an absolute nation that reigned over the Middle World back then.]", "[But that was only a part of the reason.]", "Gula\u2019s voice continued to speak.", "[The Parasite Queen knew.]", "[That if she exterminated the Empire without leaving anything behind, there would only be destruction left in Paradise\u2019s future.]", "'Only destruction left?'", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "[The moment the Empire fell, it became no different from Paradise\u2019s future falling into the hands of the Parasite Queen.]", "Gula didn\u2019t speak in circles like before, but he still couldn\u2019t understand anything like usual. Seol Jihu decided to carefully listen first.", "[The Parasite Queen devoured the Chief Deity with the power she used to conquer the Empire. She then proceeded to devour the Seven Virtues.]", "Seol Jihu knew this from hearing bits and pieces from various places.", "[At that point, there were no paths left to a hopeful future, but\u2026]", "[The appearance of another alien species, the Fallen Angels, was something outside of both her and our calculations.]", "[After the Fallen Angels established the Federation, we confirmed that the future leading to life, which we hadn\u2019t been able to see before, began to faintly appear.]", "[And so we made a decision then.]", "And that decision was\u2014", "[If it was difficult to achieve the future with the powers that remained in this world, then we would try to revive the future with the help of another world.]", "[While there was only one precedent, there was the case of the Martial God, so it was worth a try.]", "Gula\u2019s voice calmly continued.", "[It wasn\u2019t bad at first.]", "[Of course, the difference between a mortal and an immortal still existed, so we didn\u2019t expect much.]", "[But we hoped that if there were hundreds of thousands of salmon that fought against the river, maybe the current itself would change.]", "[At the very least, we hoped that it would support the future that the Federation opened up just a little bit. That\u2019s all we expected, but\u2026]", "Gula hesitated before speaking despairingly.", "[The problem was that the Parasite Queen knew of our intentions too well.]", "[As if she was ridiculing us, she began to eliminate any Earthling that had the potential to harm her, one by one.]", "[And on the other hand, she craftily picked and left alive those that would help her in the future.]", "[Her intentions were very clear. She planned to reverse our final move into one that helped her instead.]", "Seol Jihu who had been quietly listening narrowed his eyes.", "'There is one thing I\u2019m curious about.\u2019", "[What is it?]", "'If the Parasite Queen has been intentionally interfering, couldn\u2019t the Seven Gods have also helped as well? At the very least, they could have at least given a word of caution\u2026\u2019", "'The enemy is targeting you\u2019 or 'Don\u2019t remain in Paradise and return to Earth for a while.\u2019 He was asking why they couldn\u2019t have said those simple words.", "From Seol Jihu\u2019s standpoint, it was something that was at least worth a try.", "[It is impossible for two reasons.]", "Gula calmly replied.", "[The first reason is that the Parasite Queen will not give up after failing just once or twice. The second reason is that any divine interference will cause a large ripple due to the laws of causality.]", "'The laws of causality?'", "[If we interfere and cause something to happen as a result, then the Parasite Queen will receive the same right to reverse that result. This is the law of the world.]", "'I don\u2019t understand.

By seizing the position of the Chief Deity, she received the power to see the stars of destiny and the right to directly interfere with them. Her situation is different from ours.]", "Hearing this, Seol Jihu closed his mouth.", "In other words, it practically meant that the Parasite Queen was able to use maphack without any restrictions.", "He now realized how unfavorable of a fight the Seven Gods and the human camp were fighting.", "[However, there is always an exception.]", "[Luxuria was right.]", "Gula\u2019s voice suddenly rose.", "[We finally have someone who can exercise the same strength as our enemy.]", "What was this?", "[\u2026To be honest, I wanted to keep you safe a little longer.]", "[The precious ray of hope that we found when we were truly tired and desperate\u2026 I wanted to give it more time to grow.]", "[But because of Ira\u2019s selfishness, the Parasite Queen noticed it much sooner than we had hoped.]", "[And feeling an unprecedented threat, she raised up a never-before-seen army.
