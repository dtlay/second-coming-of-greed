It was a level that would automatically get him assigned to the main combat force if a draft call was ordered.", "Above all, some were called Barbarian Warriors, while others were called Pathfinders and so on.

Was making a decent class name that hard?", "Seol Jihu began brooding about how unfair she was, working him like a dog but not listening to such a simple request.", "[Haaah\u2026..]", "Gula sighed.", "[This kid\u2026. Just when I thought he was maturing a bit\u2026]", "The sound of Gula clicking her tongue echoed out.", "Seol Jihu, who left the temple as if he was driven out, came back to his senses and checked his stats.", "His stat points had increased to 10.

Anyhow, White Rose was the one losing out on two Bronze stamps.", "\u201cBut to do it without letting them know is a bit\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t feel too good if I were them.\u201d", "\"How so?\"", "\u201cThe size disparity between Carpe Diem and White Rose is just too big. The kids might prefer a large, stable workplace.\u201d", "\"Well, you\u2019re not wrong.\"", "The nodding Jang Maldong suddenly threw a question.", "\"Then why did you turn down Sinyoung?\"", "Seol Jihu hesitated. How had he known when he hadn\u2019t told anyone?", "\"There isn\u2019t a law for every decision. Everyone has their own circumstances.\u201d", "Jang Maldong grinned.", "\"I know what\u2019s troubling you, but don\u2019t worry. Those two seem like they want to leave White Rose as well.\"", "\"Yi Seol-Ah and Yi Sungjin?\"", "\"The siblings just couldn\u2019t voice it out probably. But White Rose insisted that it was the case. They said that the siblings would chase you even to the depths of hell if you told them that you\u2019d recruit the two.\u201d", "So White Rose wasn\u2019t the one trying to make them leave, but it was in fact the other way round?", "\u201cThat\u2019s why they want it to be a secret. Imagine how big their disappointment would be if you gave them hope, only for things to not work out.\u201d", "Seol Jihu suddenly asked after pondering.", "\"What kind of group is White Rose?\"", "\"I told you. Did you forget already?\"", "\"No, not that.

If you ask me why\u2026.\"", "\"No, why did you suddenly become interested in that.\"", "Jang Maldong didn\u2019t seem disapproving but just a bit taken aback. Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "\"Was it something I shouldn\u2019t have asked?\"", "\"It\u2019s not like that. As for me, I know White Rose to some extent, but you.

Have you been well?\"", "\"Yes.\"", "\"What\u2019s with the cold response? It\u2019s been several years since we last saw each other. \"", "Seeing her subtly lean the upper half of her body against the table, Jang Maldong pushed her away while making a frown.", "\u201cStay back, you\u2019re being burdensome.

You, you!\"", "\u201cWhat? Oh, you mean this?\u201d", "\u201cGet away this instance!\u201d", "Sora blinked a few times after being shouted at and obediently took her arms off.", "But she was still leaning on the back of Seol Jihu\u2019s chair, causing Jang Maldong to cover his face.", "\u201cHaah\u2026 I\u2019m terribly sorry about this.\u201d", "Bok Jungsik apologized while Jang Maldong helplessly shook his head.", "Seol Jihu slightly inhaled.

Seol Jihu who unconsciously shook her hand was startled.", "'It\u2019s rough.'", "The texture of her palm was like sandpaper. Besides the rough calluses, Seol Jihu could see a lot of scars upon careful observation.", "He could finally deduce the relationship between Jang Maldong and Phi Sora.", "'She\u2019s strong.'", "He instantly went on high alert.", "\u201cLet\u2019s see. How far have you discussed? I ran over as soon as I heard you arrived.\u201d", "Phi Sora drew back her hand and plopped herself down on the table. On top of the table, not the chair.", "It was bewildering but Seol Jihu came to his senses thanks to the cool energy from his ice spear.", "Counting numbers in his head, Seol Jihu calmly observed Phi Sora.", "The first thing that came into his eyes was her stylish crimson uniform. And upon further observation, her hair that flowed down like waterfalls seemed to have a hint of red as well.", "Adding her prideful stare and the way she sat on the table made her look flashy yet haughty like a red rose in full bloom.", "Fed up with how she was acting, Bok Jungsik spoke.", "\u201cAre you really going to be like this?\u201d", "\u201cWhat now?\u201d", "\u201cDo you really not know\u2026?

You?\u201d", "\u201cNo need for more trouble.\u201d", "\u201cI apologize for today\u2019s mess.\u201d", "Bok Jungsik sat back down rubbing his temple.", "\u201cFirst.\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s get straight to the point.\u201d", "\u201cAlright. Firstly, may I take this meeting as a sign of you being interested in the recruitment?\u201d", "\u201cHmm.\u201d", "Jang Maldong secretly sent a look while nodding.

Yes, please speak.\u201d", "\u201cAre Yi Seol-Ah and Yi Sungjin doing well?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked with a beaming smile. Bok Jungsik blinked.", "\u201cYes\u2026 they\u2019re doing fine.\u201d", "An awkward laugh rang out. It was a half-hearted laugh no matter who heard it.", "Before arriving at Scheherazade, Jang Maldong had given him two instructions.", "First, Seol Jihu had to act like he was interested in how the Yi siblings were doing. It was to make it evident that they were only here because of their friendship.", "Second, unless White Rose first spoke out, he was to never ask the reason why they were trying to send away the siblings.", "Seol Jihu smiled brightly.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a big relief.

But after our discussion\u2026\u201d", "He quickly switched the subject.", "\u201cSir, you must also be aware, but isn\u2019t money the most trustworthy thing in the transfer market?\u201d", "And so the conversation subject was switched.", "\u201cBut as you\u2019ve mentioned before, you currently don\u2019t have much in terms of funding.\u201d", "He continued after glancing at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cSo I was wondering if you could show us any items of value that you might have. For example, the Wish you received at the Banquet.\u201d", "Seol Jihu realized what Bok Jungsik was hinting at.", "\"The Harmonious Wish isn\u2019t something that can be traded, so that\u2019d be difficult.\"", "\"Of course, the Dissonant Wish is also fine.

I only received one in the first place, not to mention it was a consumable item.\u201d", "\u201cOh\u2026\u201d", "Bok Jungsik was stunned. Or at least it seemed like he had assumed Seol Jihu came out with multiple Dissonant Wishes.", "\u201cWhat to do\u2026\u201d", "But due to his pre-established prejudice, it looked like he was only keeping an act up.", "\u201cI\u2019ve heard you found a lot of success at the Banquet, so I had assumed that you\u2019d have some leftover harvest\u2026 It seems like it was my miscalculation.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stopped himself from snorting with everything he had.", "\u201cTo be honest, Yi Seol-Ah and Yi Sungjin missed you very much.\u201d", "\u201cThey must have talked about me a lot.\u201d", "\u201cYes.
