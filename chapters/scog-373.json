I\u2019ll take care of my meals, and if there are any rules I need to follow, I will make sure I do. I\u2019ll be quiet, so please let me stay.\u201d", "\u201cSure. You contracted a pinnacle-rank Spirit, so I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d", "Taihi agreed rather easily.", "\u201cI applaud your enthusiasm, but don\u2019t try to do everything alone. You\u2019re a complete beginner without any knowledge of Spirits. There is a limit to self-study. Given what our benefactor asked us to do, I would be more than willing to introduce an excellent master to you.\u201d", "She rubbed her chin and glanced sideways.", "\u201cBut it won\u2019t be easy to emulate a Fairy\u2019s art with a human body\u2026 And you would have to wield a Spirit on top of that. Are you sure you can do both?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah answered right away.", "She had already made up her mind. She didn\u2019t care about being criticized for leeching off Valhalla and Seol Jihu\u2019s achievements.", "What mattered was getting stronger.", "There was no need for her to walk the same path as her brother.

Every Sky Fairy who undergoes their coming-of-age ceremony immediately joins a patrol team and patrols the border region. Although the region is safer now because the war just ended, small-scale battles were frequent in the past.\u201d", "With that, Taihi asked furtively.", "\u201cOf course, the Federation is also recovering from the war, so we have many open slots in our patrol teams\u2026 What do you think?\u201d", "Patrolling the border region. This wasn\u2019t the region between the Federation and humanity, but the region between the Federation and the Parasites.", "Just imagining it gave Yi Seol-Ah the chills.", "Moreover, the border region must be the Hiral Mountain Range. Just patrolling the area while constantly being on the lookout would likely sap her energy.", "However, Yi Seol-Ah didn\u2019t avoid it.", "\u201cYes!\u201d", "Her comrades had fought the Army Commanders and even the Parasite Queen herself.

But, the patrol team that I am in charge of goes to the deepest, most dangerous area of Hiral Mountain Range, so please keep that in mind.\u201d", "After talking with Taihi, Yi Seol-Ah went back down. Although she decided on her own, she still needed to get permission.", "After listening to her explanation, Marcel Ghionea silently passed the communication crystal.
