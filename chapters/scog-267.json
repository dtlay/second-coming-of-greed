In fact, he had met her personally and even held a conversation with her. Not in Paradise, but on Earth.", "\u201cThis is the second time, right?\u201d", "The woman who suddenly appeared at the cafe where he was meeting with his older brother. It was Sinyoung\u2019s CEO, Yun Seohui.", "\u2018Ah.\u2019", "Kim Hannah who was standing like a statue finally snapped back.", "\u201cOh, what am I doing? Pardon me, I was just too surprised.\u201d", "She quickly collected her thoughts and cut in.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Chief Kim\u2026 Ah, excuse me, Miss Kim Hannah.\u201d", "Yun Seohui smiled gently.", "\u201cI was going to ask whether you were well, but it looks like I don\u2019t need to worry, judging by your face. I was worried about you. Really.\u201d", "Oh, now don\u2019t you look happy?", "\u201cI apologize for making Director Yun worry\u2026 Thank you for your kind words.\u201d", "Bitch, I see you haven\u2019t lost your glib tongue.", "\u201cBut you really surprised me. I never thought Sinyoung would come to our opening ceremony.\u201d", "Why the hell are you here?", "\u201cTo be honest, I was wondering whether I could go~ But Seora kept asking, so I finally decided~\u201d", "You know why.", "A conversation that should have been more coarse came out, packaged in a flowery language.", "Kim Hannah gently bit her lower lip. She expected Yun Seohui to at best mention Seol Jihu being affiliated to Sinyoung on Earth, but because she didn\u2019t expect her to mention Yun Seora, she wasn\u2019t sure what to say.", "\u201cAh, but I don\u2019t see Chief Yun here.\u201d", "\u201cShe was going to come with me, but something came up. You should have seen how dejected she was. Even I began to feel bad.\u201d", "Yun Seohui gave a believable excuse before asking suggestively.", "\u201cCan I come in?\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "At that moment, Seol Jihu stepped in.", "\u201cThank you for stopping by. Hurry on in.\u201d", "\u201cThank you!\u201d", "Yun Seohui greeted sweetly, a beautiful smile blooming on her face. Then, she hurried inside.", "Kim Hannah went \u2018Ah\u2019. She had left Yun Seohui standing for too long.", "It wasn\u2019t just because Sinyoung was publicly recognized as Paradise\u2019s number one organization. Unless they were her mortal enemy, there was no reason for her to kick them out when they made the long trip here.", "Of course, she could ask them why they were here, but Yun Seohui had already given a good explanation. A past relationship was still a relationship, after all.", "Unless there was a clear reason for Valhalla and Sinyoung to hold each other in contempt, there was nothing wrong with them having a cordial relationship \u2018on the surface\u2019.", "Currently, the two sides were neither friendly nor hostile. That was because Valhalla\u2019s representative wasn\u2019t Kim Hannah, but Seol Jihu.", "Kim Hannah had to admit. This time, Seol Jihu had reacted quicker.", "Kim Hannah left the first floor\u2019s reception work to Marcel Ghionea and followed Seol Jihu and Yun Seohui up the stairs. When the new guest entered everyone else\u2019s view, the cafeteria instantly turned silent.", "It wasn\u2019t just the cafeteria. The entire tenth floor became dead silent. Everyone\u2019s attention was directed to Yun Seohui, but she didn\u2019t shrink back in the slightest. But that didn\u2019t mean she was enjoying the stares either.", "\u201cMay I say hello?\u201d", "After first asking Seol Jihu for permission, Yun Seohui walked with a straight and upright manner in between the cafeteria tables. Soon, she stopped in front of an old man sitting at a table before bowing respectfully.", "As she bent down, her soft hair flowed down her neckline, making her look like a beauty who had come out of a painting.", "\u201cHello, it\u2019s my honor to finally meet you.\u201d", "Jang Maldong blinked his eyes a couple of times. Yun Seohui slowly raised her head and introduced herself.", "\u201cI am Sinyoung\u2019s Yun Seohui.\u201d", "When she revealed her identity, Kazuki, who was quietly sitting at the table furrowed his brows as if he doubted his ears.", "Park Dongchun, who was busy getting acquainted with Hao Win, also stared in shock.", "It couldn\u2019t be helped. Yun Seohui was chosen to be Sinyoung\u2019s next representative. Someone of her position attending Valhalla\u2019s opening ceremony was an event that could not be seen as meaningless.", "\u201cAh, so it was Sinyoung\u2019s future representative.\u201d", "Jang Maldong replied calmly.", "\u201cThough it was long ago, I remember hearing your name a few times from Yun Seojin. It\u2019s good to finally meet you.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m honored that you remember me. I\u2019ve also heard a lot about Master Jang from our chairman.\u201d", "\u201cYun Seojin talked to you about me?\u201d", "\u201cHe didn\u2019t do so a few years ago, but recently he has been reminiscing the past more often.\u201d", "Her tone was somewhat different than when she was on the first floor. It was commanding yet not arrogant, and polite yet not servile.", "Seol Jihu inwardly admired her ability to balance the emotion behind her words so perfectly.", "\u201cNow that\u2019s hard to believe. That old grinch detests talking about the past.\u201d", "\u201cHe must have changed his mind after getting old. He\u2019s still very healthy though.\u201d", "Jang Maldong nodded.", "\u201cMm. Anyway, thank you for coming. Since you\u2019re here, please make yourself at home.\u201d", "\u201cThank you. I\u2019m happy to have had a chance to talk to you.\u201d", "\u201cSay hello to Chairman Yun for me.\u201d", "\u201cI will. I\u2019m sure Father will be very happy.\u201d", "Yun Seohui replied politely before taking a few steps backward and turning around.", "Then, Seol Jihu led her to a seat. While he was thinking about what to say, Yun Seohui broke the awkward silence first.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of hearing this by now, but I have to say it again. Congratulations on officially establishing an organization.\u201d", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "\u201cI was surprised when I first heard the news. How did you turn a team into an organization in such a short period of time? I know this is rude, but I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d", "\u201cWell, we ran into several difficulties when we began. I think the dedication shown by the team members was what made it possible. Kim Hannah, especially, was an indispensable part of the process.\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied humbly.", "\u201cI see. Chief Kim is indeed very able\u2026 Ah, my apologies, Miss Kim Hannah. I\u2019ve gotten used to calling you that over the years. Fixing an old habit is difficult, as you know.\u201d", "She put her hand up to her mouth in the middle of talking and then made a troubled expression. Anyone else doing this would have looked unnatural and fake, but it looked strangely graceful when Yun Seohui was doing it.", "\u201cI hear the organization\u2019s name is Valhalla.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cValhalla. Valhalla. That\u2019s a pretty name. What is the meaning behind it?\u201d", "Yun Seohui asked as she gave a sideways glance at Seol Jihu. It seemed like a casual question that wasn\u2019t strange. But suddenly\u2026", "[Drop your head a little and loosen your pupils too. Try to remain as expressionless as possible.]", "[A persons\u2019 face, expression, glance, gesture, appearance, and even the sound of their breathing\u2026 some can synthesize even the tiniest information to guess someone\u2019s intention.]", "Agnes\u2019 advice crossed his mind. Seol Jihu fell silent for a moment before saying.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t a meaning behind it, but I was actually kind of forced to go with this name.\u201d", "\u201cYou were forced?\u201d", "\u201cI wanted to go with a different name, but the other guys were heavily against it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips while truly looking regretful.", "\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be helped. I still have regrets though.\u201d", "\u201cYou must be disappointed. What name did you want to go with?\u201d", "Yun Seohui consoled him with polite words before asking with her eyes twinkling. Seol Jihu said with a shrug.", "\u201cVeni, Vidi, Vici.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u2019", "Yun Seohui\u2019s forehead creased for the first time.", "\u201cI came, I saw, I conquered. It\u2019s a quote from Julius Caesar.\u201d", "\u201cI know that, but\u2026 you wanted to make that the organization name?\u201d", "\u201cYes. I thought it was a pretty meaningful name, but everyone laughed at me before even hearing me out.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound bad. I don\u2019t understand why everyone thinks it\u2019s so funny.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said as if to seek confirmation.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Yun Seohui thought he was joking at first. It wasn\u2019t funny, but she was going to laugh out of courtesy. However\u2026", "\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face was very serious. Yun Seohui blinked.", "\u2018Eh?\u2019 She looked like she suffered an unexpected blow.", "\u201cYes\u2026 um\u2026\u201d", "She refused to admit he was saying this seriously, but he didn\u2019t look like he was joking judging by his face.", "No matter how nicely she tried to say it, the best she could come up with was, \u2018That name is a bit odd\u2026\u2019 But she had a strong feeling Seol Jihu would try to distance himself from her if she said this aloud.", "\u201cI, I think it is a very unique name\u2026\u201d", "She laughed vaguely and barely managed to reply.", "\u201cRight? It\u2019s good, right?\u201d", "But Seol Jihu asked again. He seemed adamant about hearing a clear answer. Yun Seohui avoided his gaze subconsciously.", "\u2018H-How am I supposed to reply to this?\u2019", "This was only the second time in her life that she heard such a vague question, the first being when she met with Haesol Research Institute\u2019s CEO.", "\u201cKik.\u201d", "Then suddenly, a peal of small laughter rang out.", "Is someone trying to help me? Turning around with a bright expression, her face convulsed faintly.", "Seo Yuhui was walking over with a round plate in each of her hands. Yun Seohui\u2019s expression settled down.", "\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201d Yun Seohui greeted her first. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d", "\u201cYeah. Hello.\u201d Seo Yuhui replied with a smiling face. That was it. Seo Yuhui put the plates down, then disappeared into the kitchen without saying a word.", "Seol Jihu could feel a cold wind blowing between the two for a short moment.", "\u2018Do they know each other?\u2019", "Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have said hello so casually. Of course, Seo Yuhui might have left to let the two representatives talk by themselves, but it was true that her action was a little strange.", "Just now, Seo Yuhui didn\u2019t look at Yun Seohui at all while she was putting down the plates. It was the same when she was replying to her greeting. They felt just like acquaintances who used to be close but stopped seeing each other after a huge fight.", "However, Yun Seohui didn\u2019t seem to mind it too much. Picking up the neatly placed fruit slices from a plate, she chattered nonchalantly.", "Seol Jihu replied half-heartedly while focusing on the flow of the conversation. Now that he let Yun Seohui in, he was doing his best to figure out why she came.", "Of course, it wasn\u2019t as if he was entirely on the listening side. He asked about things that intrigued him. Or rather, he tried to ask.", "\u201cOh, yes! I suddenly remembered, the Eva incident!\u201d", "Each time, Yun Seohui instantly changed the subject. Seol Jihu retorted flatly.", "\u201cAh, yes.\u201d", "\u201cWhat you did was incredible.\u201d", "Yun Seohui cusped her hands together and spoke.", "\u201cThat incident was what caught my interest the most. I might be a step behind, but it didn\u2019t feel right to come to an opening ceremony empty-handed, so\u2026\u201d", "She glanced at one of her attendants who promptly walked up and handed her a thick envelope.", "\u201cHere\u2019s a gift. I hope you like it.\u201d", "Yun Seohui handed the envelope over quickly. Taking the envelope in the flow of the moment, Seol Jihu stared at it fixedly.", "When he looked back up, Yun Seohui smiled and gestured at him to take a look. Seol Jihu opened up the envelope, his eyes narrowing. The first page of the document inside read:", "\u2014Main Issues Regarding Queen Charlotte Aria and Evangeline\u2019s Jung Sua", "\u2018Main issues, huh.\u2019", "The document was rather thick to call it a summary of just the main issues, being dozens of pages in length. It wasn\u2019t an amount he could read right now.", "\u2018Even compiling the most recent issue wouldn\u2019t make the document this long\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu was curious about what kind of information was written inside, but he closed the envelope for now.", "\u201cThank you for the gift.\u201d", "\u201cNo problem.\u201d", "Yun Seohui replied clearly. Seol Jihu gave her a long stare.", "\u201cOh, yes.\u201d", "Looking at Yun Seohui who seemed relieved for some reason, he finally threw in a question.", "\u201cRegarding the organization name we were talking about before\u2026\u201d", "Yun Seohui shut her mouth. A small ripple spread out in her tranquil, lake-like eyes. Soon\u2026", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "She closed her eyes as if she was dizzy and pressed her forehead.", "\u201cMay I rest a little in a quiet room? I\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d", "*", "Yun Seohui really left, saying that she easily got motion-sickness and that riding the carriage over for a long time drained her energy.", "Seol Jihu offered her a room to relax in for the rest of the day, and Yun Seohui accepted it while pretending to be reluctant.", "Even after Yun Seohui moved to her room, Seol Jihu maintained his position until the end. Only after he sent off everyone who came for the event, did the opening ceremony finally come to a close.", "Afterwards, Seol Jihu immediately went to the dorm area. Knocking on a door and opening it, he saw Kim Hannah standing in the room and looking down at a table.", "On the table, of course, was the gift from Sinyoung.", "\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke casually before rushing into the room.", "\u201cWhy the heck did that person come here?\u201d", "He plopped down on the edge of the bed and asked. Although he said \u2018this person\u2019, both he and Kim Hannah knew he was referring to Yun Seohui.", "\u201cDid she come to put on airs and act domineering?\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s not that childish.\u201d", "Kim Hannah replied without taking her eyes off the report.", "\u201cAnd if that was her intention, she would have brought Sinyoung\u2019s main force.\u201d", "\u201cThen why?\u201d", "Kim Hannah didn\u2019t answer for a long time. After a brief silence, the sound of paper crumpling was heard.", "\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "With her teeth clenched, Kim Hannah squeezed the hand that was placed on the paper.", "\u201cYun Seohui? Today? At Valhalla? For what? Why?\u201d", "She couldn\u2019t figure out the two most important elements of the 5Ws and 1H.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it too much.\u201d", "Seeing Kim Hannah so upset, Seol Jihu said calmly.", "\u201cMaybe she came here without any hidden intentions.\u201d", "Kim Hannah scoffed.", "\u201cMust be nice to be so carefree.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m just saying that you don\u2019t have to try to twist everything. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to say we shouldn\u2019t do that, but it might be better to just accept things at face value.\u201d", "Kim Hannah took her eyes off the report, agreeing with Seol Jihu to an extent.", "\u201cAnyway, why did you do that?\u201d", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know. Why did you ask her about the organization name so much?\u201d", "\u201cAh, I was curious.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said while rubbing his chin.", "\u201cI couldn\u2019t openly ask why she came here, so I asked that question without much thought and got a rather unexpected reaction.\u201d", "\u201cIt was just because of her reaction?\u201d", "\u201cWell, I was a bit annoyed too.\u201d", "\u201cAnnoyed?\u201d", "\u201cI can accept her coming here, but while we were talking, she kept asking me question after question as if she came here to satiate her curiosity.\u201d", "Kim Hannah nodded. In Yun Seohui\u2019s perspective, Valhalla\u2019s sudden appearance might really be shocking. After all, it wasn\u2019t so easy to create an organization. Not to mention, they had chosen to create an organization in Eva rather than Haramark.", "\u201cShe felt a bit manipulative, trying to make me answer all her questions like it was my job. I found an opportunity to ask her a question too in the middle, so that\u2019s what I did\u2026 What\u2019s up with that face?\u201d", "Kim Hannah was looking at Seol Jihu with a renewed look.", "\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 fricking awesome. You\u2019re more discerning than I thought.\u201d", "\u201cIn what way?\u201d", "\u201cSaying that she\u2019s manipulative.\u201d", "Setting everything aside, that was one word that perfectly encapsulated Yun Seohui. As if she finally calmed down, Kim Hannah laughed.", "\u201cJeez, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen anything like it.\u201d", "\u201cLike what?\u201d", "\u201cSeeing the First Lady taking a blow in the middle of a conversation. She\u2019s usually not the type to lose with words.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smirked. He got up from the bed and walked over to the table. He figured it was probably pointless to talk about a problem they couldn\u2019t come up with an immediate answer to.", "\u201cHow\u2019s the report?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic info.\u201d", "\u201cIn more detail.\u201d", "\u201cIt records Charlotte Aria\u2019s life and how Jung Sua came to be in her current position in detail. That includes their background. It\u2019s really not missing any info.\u201d", "As expected, the gift surpassed their wildest imagination.", "The importance of information did not need to be said. There was a reason people said, know your enemy and know yourself, and you will not be defeated in a hundred battles.", "\u201cIs it usable?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just usable.\u201d", "The current situation was at a standstill. Although Valhalla had grasped the winds of triumph, Jung Sua was hanging onto the last bastion known as Eva\u2019s queen.", "And in such a situation, Sinyoung had given Valhalla a gift, a wonderful bag of goodies that could become a powerful weapon depending on how it was used.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cWays to attack their relationship.\u201d", "Kim Hannah crossed her arms, looking troubled.", "\u201cThere are so many that I don\u2019t know which one I should poke at first.\u201d", "For those wondering, I would consider this chapter \"normal\" length (~3000 words). Chapter 265, 266, 268, I would consider \"short\" (2200~2800 words). Chapter 260, 262, 263, I would consider \"long\" (3200~4000 words). 271, 272, 273 I would consider \u00a0\"super-long\" (4k+; I feel like 272 will reach 5500-ish). So that's what I mean when I say it averages out."]}
