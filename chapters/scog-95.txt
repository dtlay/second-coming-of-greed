{"cid": "95", "title": "Chapter 95. You did well, Jihu.", "content": ["After hearing Kim Hannah\u2019s brief explanation, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but be a bit puzzled.", "\u201cTo Sinyoung?\u201d", "Apparently, Kim Hannah was faced with the words, \u2018Is there a need for him to go to another company? Bring him to Sinyoung.\u2019 The person who said this was supposedly Yun Seohui, Sinyoung Pharmaceuticals\u2019s top-level executive.", "\u201cSo\u2026 I\u2019m going to become affiliated with Sinyoung?\u201d", "\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d", "Kim Hannah swirled her chopsticks around the ginseng chicken soup, her ponytail dancing in the air.", "\u201cI told you before, right? That those with the authority to invite Earthlings to Paradise have the duty to develop a safe environment for Earthlings to cross worlds.\u201d", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cThink about it that way. Nothing more, nothing less. You said you were going to the place I recommended you, so Sinyoung basically volunteered themselves. Frankly, it\u2019s not a bad deal. In fact, it\u2019s a great one.\u201d", "It seemed Sinyoung stepped up when nobody asked them to. Of course, they couldn\u2019t force Kim Hannah to invite Seol Jihu or force Seol Jihu to accept their offer.", "\u201cRight, there\u2019s no problem on the surface\u2026.\u201d", "Kim Hannah suddenly grabbed her chopsticks as if to split them in half.", "\u201cBut it still feels like shit.\u201d", "She then furrowed her brows and bore her teeth.", "\u201cThat bitch. Do you know what she said? \u2018Oh, Miss Hannah, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being a bit too greedy?\u2019 Fuck her. What business does she have with my belongings? I\u2019m the one who got that gold stamp, and I\u2019m the one who\u2019s contracted to you. That fucking whore.\u201d", "The emotions behind her voice surpassed the level of rage and resentment and treaded into the level of abhorrence and cursing. It seemed Kim Hannah\u2019s pride had really been hurt.", "\u201cAnyways, there\u2019s no problem on the surface, but you still need to stay sharp. This gives them a point of contact with you.\u201d", "\u201cDo I have to go to them? Can\u2019t you just say I declined their offer?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to.\u201d", "\u201cWell, you could always say it\u2019s personal preference.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s true, but that will only create more enemies for you. Plus, it will trouble me too.\u201d", "\u201cBut-\u201d", "Seol Jihu was about to say, \u2018But why would it?\u2019, but he swallowed his words back down. He made a somewhat meek, helpless expression.", "\u201cI\u2019m just finding it hard to understand\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d", "\u201cDid I\u2026 do something wrong?\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes widened. Seol Jihu twirled his spoon around as he continued.", "\u201cWhy is everyone so bent on harassing me? I, I just wanted to save them, that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t have other intentions. It\u2019s true that I just did what I wanted at the time, but it\u2019s not like I hurt them or inconvenienced them somehow.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m busy trying to mind my own business, yet\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s just how Paradise is.\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked at him bitterly and quietly cut him off.", "\u201cThe world isn\u2019t as simple and clear as you think. I can guarantee you one thing.\u201d", "\u201cGuarantee?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked. Kim Hannah hesitated for a long time before finally opening her mouth.", "\u201cWait. Even if you don\u2019t do anything, there will be people who curse you. The more famous you get, the more hate you\u2019ll receive. Some people will even resent you. That\u2019s not the end of it. There will be a ton of people who are going to try to use you.\u201d", "\u201cBut, but why?\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked visibly confused.", "\u201cBecause you\u2019re trying to jump ahead.\u201d", "Kim Hannah said with a bitter smile.", "\u201cThat\u2019s just how the world is.\u201d", "She muttered in a low voice. She wasn\u2019t done yet.", "\u201cThat\u2019s not all. Even on Earth, there are thousands of incidents people find hard to understand. For example, a serial killer randomly murdering people. Assailants don\u2019t care about the victims\u2019 intentions at all.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cJust look at celebrities. Sure, some of them might deserve the hate they receive, but there are a lot more who don\u2019t. Do you know why haters leave mean comments or attack them on their social media? It\u2019s simple. Because they\u2019re unhappy, because they want attention, because they\u2019re bored, because they don\u2019t like the way someone looks, because they just want to argue, because they\u2019re jealous. There are countless reasons.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was at a loss for words. He still couldn\u2019t fully understand, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything to say either.", "\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t worry about it too much.\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu\u2019s depressed expression, Kim Hannah remarked as if to console him.", "\u201cYou know who I am, right? I\u2019m your protector. I\u2019ll make sure no harm comes to you because of this, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d", "Kim Hannah seemed to have a plan from the way she was talking. Seol Jihu nodded his head, feeling somewhat apologetic in his heart. He wasn\u2019t comfortable seeing Kim Hannah run around trying to clean up the mess he made.", "After a moment of silence, Kim Hannah opened her mouth.", "\u201cAnyways, let\u2019s stop talking about that now and move onto something else. You.\u201d", "\u201cMe?\u201d", "\u201cI thought you\u2019d fool around more in Paradise. I\u2019m surprised you actually came here at the right time.\u201d", "Kim Hannah cleaned the table and put a big basket on top of it. The basket was decorated with flowers and a ribbon, and two bottles of wine could be seen inside. Seol Jihu could tell they were high-class wines just by looking at their labels.", "\u201cWow, what\u2019s this? They look expensive.\u201d", "\u201cDom Perignon, Rose Vintage 2004. It\u2019s not that expensive, about 500 thousand won per bottle.\u201d", "\u201cDom\u2026 what?\u201d", "\u201cNever mind that. Here, write.\u201d", "Kim Hannah handed him a pen and a simple but beautiful letter. When Seol Jihu stared at her blankly, she muttered as if she was looking at a fool.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you know what day it is today?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not my birthday, at least. Ah, is it yours?\u201d", "\u201cNo, mine is August 1st.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2026 a celebratory day for me getting a job?\u201d", "\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d", "Kim Hannah narrowed her eyes and chuckled.", "\u201cGeez\u2026 do you really want to reconcile with your family?\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. His father, mother, older brother, and younger sister\u2026 none of them had their birthday in May.", "\u201cToday is your parents\u2019 wedding anniversary. Wedding! Anniversary!\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cHow do you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d", "\u201cOh please, I investigated your background for half a year. Besides, how do you not know your parents\u2019\u2026. No, never mind. I guess I expected too much from a gambling addict.\u201d", "Kim Hannah shook her head before throwing the pen and letter at Seol Jihu. Of course, Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t really sure what to do with them. Never mind knowing what to write, he wasn\u2019t even sure if he should go visit them.", "\u2018Do I have to go?\u2019", "He suddenly remembered the last time he visited them.", "[Stop fucking wasting my time, okay? You think I\u2019ll fall for your lies again?]", "[Horse racing? Or sports betting?]", "More than a few weeks had passed since then, but thinking about that day still pained him, like his heart was being stabbed by a knife. Also, it made him afraid.", "\u201cCome on, what are you waiting for? Write. Let me see what you can come up with.\u201d", "\u201cUm, you know\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu forced a smile and carefully opened his mouth.", "\u201cCan I send this through their mail? I\u2019ll even pay extra to get it to them fast.\u201d", "Hearing this, Kim Hannah glared at him sharply. Seol Jihu flinched and quickly continued talking.", "\u201cI mean, today is supposed to be a happy day for them. If I go, I\u2019m only going to ruin the mood. I don\u2019t even think they\u2019ll let me in.\u201d", "\u201cHey.\u201d", "Kim Hannah frowned and folded her arms.", "\u201cIf you have a brain, use it. You\u2019re already a piece of trash. If you were in your parents\u2019 shoes, what would you think if their trash of a son sent a single letter by mail for their anniversary? You think they\u2019d go, \u2018Oh~ Our son is taking care of us now that he\u2019s financial stable~ What a good boy~\u2019, huh?\u201d", "Seol Jihu had nothing to say to Kim Hannah\u2019s sarcastic remark.", "\u201cTo your family, you\u2019re still a gambling addict. Don\u2019t you want to escape from that image?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cTell me.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I do.\u201d", "Seol Jihu barely eked out an answer. Kim Hannah pointed to the basket with her chin.", "\u201cThen take this and go tell them. Look at them in the eye and beg for their forgiveness. Isn\u2019t that the least you can do as their son?\u201d", "Seol Jihu could only wordlessly wet his lips.", "\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? Do you have any idea how long it takes to heal a wounded heart? Begging for their forgiveness dozens of times might not be enough, but\u2026 mail?\u201d", "Kim Hannah snorted as if she just heard the most absurd joke in the world.", "\u201cAnd let\u2019s get this straight. Just like you said, they might not even let you in. You\u2019ll definitely ruin the mood if you go. But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t. You don\u2019t want to go because you know how they will treat you. You\u2019re avoiding them.\u201d", "Seol Jihu felt dazed by Kim Hannah\u2019s violent flurry of facts.", "\u201cNo, that\u2019s not-\u201d", "\u201cYou really are a bastard, aren\u2019t you? After leaving them with so many wounds, you\u2019re scared of getting yelled at? Are you for real?\u201d", "\u201cHey.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? You think I\u2019m exaggerating? You want me to stop? Fine, do what you want. They\u2019re your family, not mine.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Okay, okay, I get it.\u201d", "In the end, Seol Jihu gave in and grabbed the pen. Seeing him take the letter, Kim Hannah snorted once again.", "\u201cWhat matters is you going to see them. And make sure to write each word carefully and cleanly. What heals a wounded heart isn\u2019t time or medicine. It\u2019s sincerity.\u201d", "\u201cI know\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu pouted his lower lips but began to slowly move the pen in his hand. Seeing him wrecking his brain trying to come up with the right words, Kim Hannah smiled secretly.", "She had made thorough preparations for their meeting. She had answers ready for anything they might ask, including information regarding the company that \u2018hired\u2019 him and the source of the money he previously received. She even prepared a formal suit for him to wear.", "Of course, it wasn\u2019t a brand new one. The collar of the dress shirt was loose, and the suit jacket gave off an aged smell. Simply put, it was the suit of a typical company employee working overtime every day. That was the hardworking company employee look Kim Hannah was going for.", "\u2018Do I have to go this far?\u2019", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but wonder, but he still did as Kim Hannah said and waited until it seemed like the right time to visit.", "The sun was setting, and the sky was dyed in orange light. It was a little past seven. He had purposely avoided visiting them during dinner time. Given what he knew about his parents\u2019 personalities, he knew they would be having a celebratory dinner.", "Rather than coming before dinner time and making it difficult for them to swallow food, he judged it would be better once they had time to digest what they ate.", "\u2018Calm down, heart, please.\u2019", "As familiar buildings came into view, his heart pounded harder and harder. He had experienced the same feeling once before, yet fear flooded in like a tidal wave.", "He knew what would happen, but he couldn\u2019t help but remain a little hopeful.", "\u2018Don\u2019t expect anything, don\u2019t expect anything.\u2019", "He recited the same line over and over again in his heart like it was some sort of a magical spell. Before long, he arrived at his destination.", "He carefully opened the main gate and walked up the staircase. His legs moved quickly at first, but when he arrived at the front door, they slowed to a pause.", "With a briefcase in one hand and the basket Kim Hannah prepared in the other, Seol Jihu stared at the closed door for a long time. His pounding heart didn\u2019t slow down and only got faster. He was even beginning to worry that it would burst out of his chest.", "\u201cHuuu\u2026.\u201d", "He smacked his chest a couple times and pressed the doorbell after much deliberation. Ding, ding The ringing sent a shiver down his spine, almost like it was an alarm alerting the start of his execution.", "A queasy feeling was beginning to well up inside his stomach when\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "The ringing ended. He pressed the doorbell again, but he couldn\u2019t hear anyone coming to the door. The front door remained shut.", "\u2018Are they out?\u2019", "Given the occasion, it would make sense if they went out for dinner. Once his thoughts reached here, he suddenly felt air leaving his body, and a sense of relief rushed in.", "\u2018What should I do?\u2019", "Should I wait? Or just leave the basket here? Seol Jihu paced back and forth in the hallway for dozens of minutes before finally deciding to place the basket in front of the door.", "After putting the letter he took great effort to write between the flowers, he turned around. It was then.", "\u201cHaha\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, so I\u2026.\u201d", "He could hear the sound of harmonious talking coming from a distance.", "\u201cI was almost disappointed when you said you couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d", "\u201cSorry, something came up suddenly\u2026.\u201d", "The sound quickly grew louder.", "\u201cYou resolved everything?\u201d", "\u201cYes, thankfully\u2026.\u201d", "And it soon approached the main gate.", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "By the time Seol Jihu snapped out of his daze, they had already gone inside. For some reason, Seol Jihu was looking for a place to hide. Of course, there wasn\u2019t anything like it.", "\u201cWait, why is the main gate open\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cDid you not close it on your way out, Oppa?\u201d", "\u201cI did.\u201d", "\u201cWait, maybe someone came?\u201d", "Seol Jihu began making his way down when he ran into them. The moment the six pairs of eyes discovered the young man, their harmonious chitchat stopped.", "The first one to speak was Seol Jinhee.", "\u201cThe hell? Why is that son of a bitch here?\u201d", "Her curt tone stung. Seol Jihu was just as flustered as anyone else. He somewhat suspected that this would be the case, but on top of his father, mother, older brother, and younger sister, Yoo Seonhwa and Yoo Seunghae were there as well.", "The six of them seemed to have returned after eating out. As the young man wasn\u2019t expecting to meet them this way, he only stared at them in a daze. Seeing this, a brown-skinned middle-aged man opened his mouth slightly.", "\u201cYou.\u201d", "But that only lasted a moment. His face quickly distorted, and he immediately shut his mouth.", "\u201c\u2026Kuhum!\u201d", "He gave the young man a sharp glare before stomping up the stairs silently. After that, he didn\u2019t look at the young man, much less talk to him. He purposely ignored the basket in front of the door and pressed the doorlock password.", "\u201cSon?\u201d", "As the young man was about to turn into a fish out of water, a nostalgic voice flowed into his ears. His mother was looking up at him with an entranced look.", "\u201cM-Mom.\u201d", "\u201cAigo, aigo, my little son\u2026.\u201d", "She staggered up the stairs and was about to grab his hand when his father threw the door open and shouted.", "\u201cWhat are you doing!? Come inside!\u201d", "Startled, the mother\u2019s complexion distorted.", "\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean what am I doing? Why don\u2019t you ask that bastard!?\u201d", "When the young man\u2019s father came outside and began approaching him with his fist clenched, his mother quickly stepped between the two of them.", "\u201cCalm down. He came to visit us.\u201d", "\u201cVisit us? So what!?\u201d", "\u201cDear, can\u2019t you tell Jihu\u2019s been walking on eggshells since a while ago? How can you just ignore him\u2026. Don\u2019t you feel bad?\u201d", "Ha! A loud snort followed.", "\u201cYou\u2019re the problem. How many times have you been tricked until now? You still don\u2019t get it? This bastard isn\u2019t a human being. He\u2019s just a piece of trash. He\u2019s worse than a beast.\u201d", "The atmosphere quickly changed for the worse. Perhaps because loud voices were flying back and forth, Yoo Seunghae hid behind her older sister, and Seol Jinhee watched the spectacle with a satisfied look on her face.", "Everyone had different reactions, but one thing Seol Jihu could be sure of was that they were looking at him with eyes that seemed to say, \u2018Why did you come?\u2019", "This is why I didn\u2019t want to come.", "Facing the looks of scorn and being battered by coarse condemnation, Seol Jihu closed his eyes tight. His father and mother were still arguing.", "\u201cHe said he quit gambling and is working hard now.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you believe that? Ah~ The casino ban? Seorak Land isn\u2019t the only casino in Korea. It\u2019s obvious what he\u2019s up to. Do I need to spell it out for you?\u201d", "\u201cStop it, would you!? He already paid back what he owed. He even came to see us with a gift knowing it was our anniversary. We should at least hear him out.\u201d", "\u201cPaid back what he owed? You want to talk about money? Fine.\u201d", "Thud! The door shot open. Loud stomps rang out, and something smacked Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "\u201cEup!\u201d", "Seol Jihu opened his eyes, only to see an envelope falling down with a wad of cash inside.", "\u201cYou bastard!\u201d", "His father yelled with his finger pointed at him.", "\u201cYou think the past\u2019s all gone and done now that you returned the money? You want to go back to acting like a son?\u201d", "\u201cF-Father.\u201d", "\u201cShut it! Don\u2019t call me father. I don\u2019t remember having a bastard like you as my son!\u201d", "His thunderous roar made his wife flinch. Seol Jihu opened his mouth as calmly as he could.", "\u201cFather, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI told you to shut it!\u201d", "He yelled as if he didn\u2019t want to hear a thing. His anger didn\u2019t seem to reside after all that yelling as his breathing continued to get rough.", "\u201cYou. I told you before, didn\u2019t I? That you should never do anything ever again to make you apologize or give an excuse.\u201d", "His growling way of talking made Seol Jihu shut his mouth.", "\u201cY-You shameless son of a bitch. You think money was the problem? You think everything\u2019s over after throwing us an envelope of money without even a simple explanation!? Huh!?\u201d", "\u201cFather\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI told you to shut up. I dare you to open your mouth again. I\u2019ll rip it to shreds.\u201d", "\u201cDear!\u201d", "\u201cNow screw off! I don\u2019t want to see you again!\u201d", "Eii! After a loud grunt, Seol Jihu\u2019s father turned around and stomped into the house. His mother chased after him to plead with him. Soon, loud arguing rang out once more, and Seol Jihu bit his lips from rising guilt.", "They must have been having fun. I shouldn\u2019t have come.", "A heavy silence descended. Seol Wooseok, who was standing still a distance away, scratched the back of his head. Looking at his younger brother standing there like a stone statue, he opened his mouth.", "\u201c\u2026You came from work?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Huh? Oh, um, yeah.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded with a dazed look. He might be mistaken, but Seol Wooseok\u2019s voice seemed to have gotten a tad gentler.", "\u201cYou should have come a bit earlier. We went to the place you like.\u201d", "\u201cBong Pyeongyang?\u201d", "\u201cYep. You love their naengmyeon.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 well, if I came earlier, you guys probably wouldn\u2019t have eaten anything.\u201d", "\u201cI guess.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok chuckled bitterly.", "Seol Jihu swallowed hard. How long had it been since he last held a conversation with his older brother? He didn\u2019t know what to make of it.", "Seol Wooseok glanced at the basket in front of the door and opened his mouth.", "\u201cAre you busy today too? You\u2019re not planning on going back after just dropping this off, are you?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026No, I\u2019ve been waiting for you guys to come back.\u201d", "\u201cThen come in.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok held up the black plastic bag in his hand.", "\u201cCome eat some dessert. It\u2019s ice cream.\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked repeatedly. For a moment, he doubted his own ears.", "\u201cI\u2026 I can?\u201d", "\u201cYou came to talk to them, right?\u201d", "\u201cGod, spare me the bullshit.\u201d", "At that moment, a sharp voice cut in between them.", "\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d", "Seol Jinhee walked closer with a sneering smirk on her face.", "\u201cJinhee.\u201d", "\u201cStay out of this, Oppa. Hey, can\u2019t you take a fucking hint?\u201d", "She raised her hand and poked Seol Jihu\u2019s chest with her finger. In truth, it was closer to a stab as he flinched in pain.", "\u201cYou saw what happened last time and you still came? Don\u2019t you get it? \u2018I know how they\u2019ll treat me, so I shouldn\u2019t come here again. That\u2019s the least I can do for the people who were once my family\u2019. Didn\u2019t something like this pop into your head? Huh?\u201d", "Poke, poke! Because of Seol Jinhee\u2019s repeated stabbing pokes, Seol Jihu stepped backwards without even noticing it.", "\u201cIf you paid back your debts, please disappear from our lives. You saw how you ruined the atmosphere, right? We\u2019re happy and healthy without you, so why do you come and cause this mess?\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t deny it. He could still hear his parents arguing inside the house.", "\u201cYou. Get. It. Now? Stop trying to crawl back in and fuck off. And don\u2019t ever appear in front of us again. Okay? You get me?\u201d", "\u201cEuk!\u201d", "Poke! Seol Jinhee suddenly stabbed his solar plexus, causing him to bend down and groan.", "\u201cSeol Jinhee.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok stepped in, unable to watch this any further. However, Seol Jihu raised his hand and stopped him.", "\u201cI-It\u2019s fine.\u201d", "He rubbed his solar plexus and forced out a smile.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go back for today.\u201d", "\u201cNot just for today, but forever. Please.\u201d", "Leaving behind Seol Jinhee who harassed him until the end, Seol Jihu staggered towards the staircase. He felt like his brother and sister would start fighting if he stayed any longer, so he figured it would be better for everyone if he just left now.", "But just as he was about to walk down the stairs, his eyes met Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s. She seemed to be at a loss for what to do, but she was clearly looking at him with mixed feelings of pity and sympathy.", "Unable to endure the sense of humiliation that dawned on him, Seol Jihu quickened his pace. It was then.", "\u201cHey!\u201d", "He turned around hearing Seol Jinhee\u2019s voice.", "\u201cTake this.\u201d", "Whoosh- The basket came flying towards him.", "Clang! After hitting the corner of the concrete stair, the wine bottle shattered with a loud bang. The liquid dripping out from the broken bottle wet the letter Seol Jihu wrote, and the petals of the flowers danced in the air before scattering everywhere.", "\u201cSeol Jinhee!\u201d", "\u201cWhat!?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re going too far!\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re the one to talk, Oppa\u2026!\u201d", "The brother and sister finally began fighting. Seol Jihu blankly stared at the liquid spreading out on the concrete before squatting down.", "He picked up the flower petals and the pieces of broken glass. He then heard the sound of someone\u2019s footsteps rushing down the stairs. This person squatted down across from him.", "\u201cDon\u2019t pick up the broken glass. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d", "Ssk, ssk- She spoke as she swept the broken glass together with her hand. This young woman with long, flowing hair was Yoo Seonhwa.", "\u201c\u2026Seonhwa.\u201d", "\u201cWait here. I\u2019ll go bring a vacuum cleaner.\u201d", "\u201cSeonhwa.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s hand paused. The piece of broken glass in Seol Jihu\u2019s tightened fist dug into his palm. Blood dripped down to the ground. A crimson liquid began to spread out, and Yoo Seonhwa jumped in surprise seeing the young man\u2019s trembling hand.", "\u201cGo back. I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d", "Seol Jihu murmured quietly.", "\u201cY-You\u2019re bleeding.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You can go back.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cPlease, go back. Please.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s calm voice only made Yoo Seonhwa look at him with sorrowful eyes.", "He clenched his teeth. Soon, after picking all the flower petals and pieces of broken glass up from the ground, Seol Jihu staggered off like a drunk.", "During that entire time, his head remained tilted down.", "*", "Time passed and darkness descended on the streets after dusk. Under a streetlight illuminating a street, Kim Hannah stood leaning against her car and looking up at the night sky. It wasn\u2019t until footsteps neared her that she lowered her gaze. Seeing a young man walking closer with a basket in hand, she smiled brightly.", "She waited until he got closer before finally opening her mouth.", "\u201cIf you keep staring at the ground like that, you\u2019re going to run into something.\u201d", "The young man came to a stop. Kim Hannah could hear him inhale a small breath.", "\u201c\u2026You were waiting?\u201d", "Surprisingly, his voice seemed fine.", "\u201cI came just in case you ran off elsewhere. Well, judging by that basket, it looks like you really went.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep tabs on me. What are you, a stalker?\u201d", "\u201cStalker? I prefer the word, protector.\u201d", "Kim Hannah said with a languid smile.", "\u201cHow was it?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you can tell.\u201d", "\u201cI can. But do you regret going?\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t immediately reply. Kim Hannah patiently waited for him. After about five minutes of silence, he finally opened his mouth.", "\u201cYou know how I\u2026 I lived like a piece of trash?\u201d", "\u201cIn the past.\u201d", "\u201cI made a lot of wrongs, too many to be forgiven with just one or two apologies. I deserved everything I got today.\u201d", "\u201cWell, you and I both know that.\u201d", "He sighed.", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "Then\u2026", "\u201cI know I deserved it\u2026.\u201d", "His voice began to tremble.", "\u201cI know I\u2019m the one who\u2019s at fault.\u201d", "His shoulders shook.", "\u201cI know\u2026 all that\u2026.\u201d", "After listening to him for a while, Kim Hannah took her back off her car and slowly walked forward. She bent forward and looked up at the young man whose face was lowered.", "Tk, tk. Seeing the drops of tear flow down his already-wet cheeks, she smiled.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d", "Kim Hannah hugged the silently crying Seol Jihu and patted his back.", "\u201cYou did well, Jihu.\u201d"]}
