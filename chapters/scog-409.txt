Including the one that I hid, we know the location of two of the steles.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun raised his index finger and middle finger before continuing with a but.", "\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t know where the last stele is. I know it\u2019s not in the territory of the Federation or humanity, but I wasn\u2019t told anything more. But there\u2019s a way to find out. We would have to use a little bit of force though.\u201d", "The Parasite Queen listened to Sung Shihyun without missing a single word.", "Though she had her eyes closed, her mind was making calculations at a frightening speed.", "Was it possible or impossible? Should it be done or should it be not?", "\u201cIt\u2019s simple, really.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun continued.", "\u201cIf we succeed in baiting out the Brightest Star? Then we\u2019ll drop everything we\u2019re doing and solely focus on just attacking him. Even if he is under the protection of this world, he should not be able to survive the onslaught of the Parasites\u2019 whole force.\u201d", "On the other hand.", "\u201cBut what if we fail to bait him out? Though it would be a shame, it\u2019s still not too bad because the Parasites would still have gained something. Something that swept away the past era\u2019s Empire, Orc Kingdom, and other nations and races\u2026\u201d", "Sung Shihyun paused and rolled his eyes in a circle.", "\u201cActually, we don\u2019t even need to go that far back. Your Majesty wiped out half of the allied forces at Tigol Fortress by unleashing divinity thrice. So imagine how they would react. Even I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d", "[Now that you mention it\u2026]", "The Parasite Queen smiled furtively after having listened quietly.", "[Even I am greatly tempted by the prospect. I don\u2019t want to give up either one.]", "\u201cAh, please, Greedy Queen.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun dropped his hands in an exaggerated manner.", "\u201cPick one. Just one. Do you want to chase after two rabbits again only to catch none?\u201d", "\u201cI know how tempting it is, but didn\u2019t you already experience it once during the Tigol Fortress War? Unexpected factors are bound to come into play this time around as well, so let\u2019s just focus on doing one thing.\u201d", "The Parasite Queen chuckled at Sung Shihyun\u2019s rather adorable grumbling.", "Her mood, which had hit rock-bottom just yesterday, was gradually going up.", "It was because she felt like talking to Sung Shihyun was broadening the Parasites\u2019 future.", "\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun spread out his arms.", "\u201cWhether this plan is worth carrying out, and which of the two we will focus on if we do, will depend on Your Majesty\u2019s judgment.\u201d", "He then bowed down like a magician bowing before his audience.", "*", "After Sung Shihyun left, the Parasite Queen became lost in thought for a long time in the empty grand hall.", "What Sung Shihyun said wasn\u2019t wrong.", "Humanity was currently advancing toward a better future. She had to nip the bud before the change properly set in.", "In truth, the Parasites had to make a move now. Rather than this being the ideal time, it was because they already expended a lot of time recovering their forces.", "Thinking in this way, Sung Shihyun\u2019s offer wasn\u2019t so bad. In fact, it was quite excellent.", "It was a low-risk, high-return plan.", "The problem was deciding which rabbit to catch.", "[Oh yes, let me say just one more thing before I go.]", "[If Your Majesty chooses the first option, you will have to be very careful with how to eliminate the Brightest Star.]", "[You must know that Earthlings can revive once using a Divine Wish.]", "[If he dies without being corrupted or commits suicide after being captured, our efforts would have been for nothing.]", "[If we choose to kill him, we need to make sure he dies completely. We need to make it so that he won\u2019t be able to do anything even if he revives.]", "[Is it possible? Yes, of course! I know the weak point of the Earthlings\u2019 revival clause.]", "Recalling Sung Shihyun\u2019s words, the Parasite Queen slowly opened her eyes.", "She then came to the decision: although the offered plan is a little vague, it can be a huge success depending on how it\u2019s carried out.", "That said, she didn\u2019t order Sung Shihyun to outline a detailed plan. Their next attack would be a different method than the frontal-breakthrough approach they had been using.", "Moreover, as the Parasites\u2019 future rested on its outcome, she wanted to devote her own time into perfecting the plan.", "And just now, she had completed the plan.", "The Parasite Queen immediately summoned the Third Army Commander.", "\u201cI\u2019ve come, my dear queen.\u201d", "After hurrying into the grand hall, the black-hooded Army Commander bowed respectfully.", "The Third Army Commander, Abhorrent Charity, was a necromancer. To be more precise, he was an Archlich, once a powerful magician who desired immortality, laying his hands on necromancy and transforming into an undead.", "As he pursued the Path of the Mana for hundreds of years, he was familiar, not only with necromancy but with all types of magic.", "[The reason I have called you here today is to ask you for a favor.]", "\u201cA favor? Your command is my wish, my dear queen.\u201d", "[Then I will be frank.]", "The Parasite Queen nodded and then spoke.", "[Prepare a surprise attack.]", "\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d", "Abhorrent Charity looked taken aback as if he had not expected such an order.", "The \u201csurprise attack\u201d mentioned by the Parasite Queen meant using a large-scale teleportation spell to force oneself into the heart of the enemy. With the enemy having the defender\u2019s advantage, it would naturally come at a huge risk.", "Teleport. This powerful spell allowed for instantaneous, long-distance travel, but it also came with many restrictions.", "The distance traveled depended on the mana of the spellcaster and the volume and mass of the teleporting matter.", "For example, \u201ctake the Parasites\u2019 whole force and teleport to humanity\u2019s capital,\u201d would be too difficult a task for even Abhorrent Charity, who was familiar with magic and obtained a level of existence of a demigod.", "\u201cI assume you don\u2019t mean for me to go alone.\u201d", "[Take three other Army Commanders and their armies.]", "\u201cAnd the distance\u2026\u201d", "[From where you are standing right now to Scheherazade. Is it possible?]", "\u201cTo Scheherazade\u2026!\u201d", "Abhorrent Charity gasped. It was not an easy task at all. However, the Third Army Commander fell into thought without complaining.", "In truth, given the effectiveness of a surprise attack using Teleport, he had brought up this idea several times in the past.", "However, the Parasite Queen had held off on the idea back then for a few different reasons.", "The biggest reason was just how much risk it carried.", "A large-scale teleportation required a long time in both its activation stage and the actual movement stage. If they teleported to the middle of Tigol Fortress and became the focal point of a barrage of Thunders, they would just be a laughingstock of the whole world.", "So, they had to launch the surprise attack without the enemy finding out to maximize its effectiveness, but even this would only be a one-time thing.", "Unless their enemy were fools, they would prepare for another surprise attack after the first time, and this meant the risk of teleporting would only get higher.", "And so, the Parasite Queen had put off the plan of using long-distance teleportation, keeping it hidden for when it became necessary.", "And today, the Parasite Queen mentioned this hidden card.", "Abhorrent Charity thought for a long time before replying.", "\u201cIt is not possible as of now. To make it possible with those conditions, I need four things.\u201d", "[Four. That is quite a lot. Speak.]", "\u201cThe first is the Seventh Army Commander\u2019s assistance.\u201d", "[That will be easy.]", "The Seventh Army Commander, Twisted Kindness, was a member of the Dragon race. With her profound knowledge of magic, she should be able to shoulder Abhorrent Charity\u2019s burden.", "\u201cThe second, though only an assumption, is that I can only bring three or four Army Commanders with me at most. And among them, the First Army Commander and Seventh Army Commander must be included.\u201d", "[I shall allow it.]", "Sung Shihyun and Twisted Kindness had fully absorbed their divinity and thus did not command their own armies.", "That was to say, Abhorrent Charity would only be able to teleport three armies at most.", "\u201cThe third is that my capabilities are limited. It will be difficult for me to use such a massive spell in my current state.\u201d", "[I shall permit the release of your divinity.]", "The Parasite Queen gave her permission easily, but Abhorrent Charity smiled bitterly on the inside. He had only just finished recuperating from the aftermath of the Tigol Fortress War, but it seemed like he would be resting again soon.", "\u201cThe fourth, I\u2019m ashamed to say, is that the success of the spell is uncertain even with the other three conditions being met. And so, I will need magic circles to help lessen the burden. Not only at the starting location, but also at the destination.\u201d", "[You don\u2019t have to worry about that.]", "The Parasite Queen spoke.", "[There is someone to help you at both the starting location and the destination.]", "\u201cPardon\u2026?\u201d", "Abhorrent Charity muttered confusedly and then did a double-take.", "\u201cAh, we do have a \u201clink\u201d in Scheherazade\u2026\u201d", "[Fufu\u2026.]", "The Parasite Queen chuckled faintly.", "[Now then, I will tell you the starting location, the destination, and when to launch the surprise attack.]", "\u201cPlease.\u201d", "[First\u2026]", "The Parasite Queen revealed her plan at last.", "Then, seemingly having heard something absurd, Abhorrent Charity suddenly raised his lowered head.", "\u201cP-Pardon?\u201d", "The more the Parasite Queen spoke, the more dazed Abhorrent Charity became.", "\u201cThen\u2026!\u201d", "[Quiet. Do you understand?]", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "[Good. I will immediately summon the Army Commanders again, so you should make preparations so that all goes according to plan.]", "\u201cYour humble servant accepts your command.\u201d", "Abhorrent Charity bent his waist all the way and then hurriedly left the grand hall.", "The Parasites began to move again at last.", "Secretly and stealthily, without the Federation and humanity knowing.", "*", "The carriage holding Valhalla\u2019s members arrived in Eva.", "And before they even went back to Valhalla\u2019s building, Seol Jihu got a call.", "It was to deliver the news that all employees had finished signing the contract.", "\u201cIya~ They sure work fast.\u201d", "\u201cThey better if they wanna live. It would\u2019ve been better if they did it earlier!\u201d", "Everyone chattered loudly and in a good mood while entering through the main entrance.", "\u201cEh?\u201d", "Phi Sora, who walked at the front, suddenly came to a stop.", "A little chick with two feathers sticking out of its head was dozing off in the middle of the garden while basking under the sunlight.", "\u201cShh!\u201d Phi Sora looked back at everyone and put up a finger to her mouth.", "As others looked at her curiously, she grinned and slowly approached the peacefully napping Little Chick.", "\u201cFus~\u201d", "After bending down a little and taking a deep breath\u2026", "\u201cRO DAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201d", "She screamed.", "\u201cPiyaaaaak!?\u201d", "Little Chick spread its wings and flew up in a startle before stumbling back down and rolling over.", "Boisterous laughter burst out.", "\u201cW-What the heck!?\u201d", "Little Chick shook its head and then made a dazed face after seeing the cackling Valhalla members.", "It then saw Phi Sora who was cracking up and glared at her.", "\u201cYou dare!\u201d", "It raised its tiny beak, flying up like a butterfly and stinging her knee like a bee.", "\u201cOw!\u201d", "\u201cYou wanna die? You wanna dieeee!?\u201d", "\u201cSorry, sorry! My bad!\u201d", "Phi Sora fell on her butt laughing and then wrapped her arms around her knees.", "\u201cYou were just too cute dozing off in the garden!\u201d", "\u201cWhat a load of a bull!
