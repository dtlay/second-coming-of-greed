But despite his restless mind, he was able to sleep with no trouble.", "In his light sleep, he felt someone\u2019s hand carefully embracing his neck. And when a squishy sensation softly pressed down on his face, he let go of his mind as if his previous troubled state was a lie.", "Every time he tossed and turned, a gentle touch slowly stroked his back or patted it. And when a sleep-inducing scent flowed into his nostrils, he quickly fell back to sleep.", "Amidst a quietness and stillness that felt like a wonderful grass field embracing his body, Seol Jihu slept like a baby without waking up once.", "As a result, when he woke up, his perplexed mind had subsided by a degree.", "Seol Jihu tilted his head as he rubbed his eyes under the morning sunlight.", "\u2018Strange.\u2019", "His body was soaked with an unknown scent. Smelling this refreshing scent that made his heart pound, Seol Jihu buried his face in his arms and clothes and took deep breaths.", "Thinking about it now, he felt like someone was taking care of him in his sleep.

Can you please describe it in detail?\u201d", "For example, Sakamoto Jun muttered strange things in a polite manner of speech, which was different than the casual tone he usually used. Hugo, on the other hand, tried to smell Seol Jihu or rub his face on his clothes.", "\u201cHey\u2014 Stop\u2014\u201d", "It took Seol Jihu painstaking effort to push the bull-like Hugo off of himself.", "\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d", "\u201cEvil bastard!\u201d", "\u201cHuh?\u201d", "\u201cTraitor!\u201d", "Hugo\u2019s expression had surpassed jealousy and envy, and was dyed with rage.", "Seol Jihu looked around with a confused face. Seeing Kazuki turn around and face him, Seol Jihu gave him a look asking to be saved.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "But rather than saving him, Kazuki sent him a curious gaze before stealthily glancing to the side. There, Seol Jihu saw Seo Yuhui walking with her head down.", "When he met her eyes, Seo Yuhui\u2019s face turned red like a sunset reflected on a river. She turned away and looked into the far distance.", "Well, there really wasn\u2019t much to see because they were on a grass plain.", "Seol Jihu quickly realized something must have happened while he was asleep, but he also stopped caring about it.", "This was because he began to see a black dot in the distance.", "Soon, when grey castle walls began to appear, Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes sparkled.", "It was Haramark.", "The Alliance team had finally returned to Haramark after two weeks.", "Before departing, Seol Jihu and Kazuki shook hands.", "\u201cGood job.\u201d", "\u201cYou too, Mister Kazuki.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu returned the words with courtesy, Kazuki tilted his head.", "\u201cHm\u2026 I don\u2019t think I did anything to warrant being called a good job. Without you, we might still be in Stage 2.\u201d Kazuki continued, \u201cAnd\u2026 I apologize for saying you were stubborn back in the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "That conversation during the training must have been bothering Kazuki the entire time.", "Although Seol Jihu had forgotten about it completely, Kazuki was the type of person who was just as strict with himself as he was with others.", "Seol Jihu asked.", "\u201cWill you participate in the next Banquet too?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Contrary to Seol Jihu\u2019s expectations, Kazuki answered firmly.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I think it might be better for me to let it go.\u201d", "The way Kazuki muttered calmly looked bitter.", "With the end of this Banquet, Kazuki would go separate ways from the Japan Business Federation borrowing the Triads\u2019 power, since that would be difficult to do alone.", "Seol Jihu stared at him fixedly before opening his mouth.", "\u201cMister Kazuki.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cHave you considered coming to Carpe Diem?\u201d", "Hearing this sudden offer, Chohong, who was yawning loudly, widened her eyes in surprise. Even Hugo, who was holding onto Seo Yuhui\u2019s hand and refusing to let go, jumped and turned around in surprise.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes gazed at Kazuki. Rather than carefully deliberating on this decision, Seol Jihu had thought of it on the spot.", "To be more precise, he wanted to try working with him. The man in front of him might fill in the gap left behind by Dylan\u2026. No, Seol Jihu was convinced Kazuki would do more than fill the gap.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me an answer immediately.\u201d", "\u201cI will refuse.\u201d", "However, Kazuki shook his head almost immediately.", "\u201cI might have considered it more if you had asked before the Banquet\u2026.\u201d", "Kazuki rubbed his chin, and then smirked.", "\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to let go of the steering wheel just yet.\u201d", "\u201cSteering wheel?\u201d", "\u201cThere can\u2019t be two captains on the same ship, no?\u201d", "It was then that Seol Jihu realized why Kazuki had declined.", "With a grin, Kazuki turned around and raised his hand.", "\u201cSee you later.\u201d", "Seeing Kazuki walk away with just those three words, Seol Jihu scratched his cheek with his finger. He felt embarrassed, like a child who had his inner thoughts revealed.", "After saying goodbye to everyone else, Seol Jihu headed back to Carpe Diem\u2019s office with Chohong.", "Just as he was about to arrive at the building he dreamed of, he encountered an unexpected person. The old man in a black suit walking toward them from the opposite direction was Jang Maldong.", "\u201cOld Man?\u201d Chohong spoke first. \u201cYou\u2019re still alive?\u201d", "Thwack!", "\u201cArrrgh!\u201d", "Chohong clutched her head and rolled on the ground.", "\u201cArgh! Why\u2019d you hit me?\u201d", "\u201cDamned fool. Why don\u2019t you go pay for another Ceremony to have me killed?\u201d", "\u201cI was just saying hello because I missed you!\u201d", "\u201cOh yeah?\u201d", "When Jang Maldong raised his cane again, Chohong quickly shot up and escaped.

What about you, Master\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m coming back after meeting an applicant for the team.\u201d", "Seol Jihu let out a small exclamation. By \u2018applicant\u2019, he had to be referring to a new Archer.", "Jang Maldong must have been hard at work while they were away at the Banquet.", "\u201cI stealthily made the offer to Mister Kazuki, but I got rejected.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s obvious. Why would he enter this team given his position in Paradise? Anyways, where\u2019s Hugo?\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu hesitate, Jang Maldong clicked his tongue.", "\u201cNever mind. He\u2019s probably gone straight to the pub like he always does. I wonder when he\u2019ll fix that habit, tsk.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly. He couldn\u2019t bring it upon himself to tell him that Hugo chased after Seo Yuhui.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go up.\u201d", "Jang Maldong got on the stairs without further ado. Once he entered the office, he took off his suit and plopped down.", "\u201cWhew, now I feel alive. There were too many recommendations\u2026 I\u2019ve practically had a tour of all of Paradise\u2019s cities\u2026. Hm?\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu standing still, Jang Maldong asked.", "\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you sitting?\u201d", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "When the young man suddenly bowed down to his waist and thanked him, Jang Maldong blinked his eyes.", "\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d", "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, Master\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stood straight and spoke with sincerity.", "\u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t be standing in this office right now.\u201d", "He wasn\u2019t wrong. If it weren\u2019t for Jang Maldong\u2019s hellish training, Seol Jihu might have died or have been eliminated in Stage 1.", "\u201cThanks to Master\u2019s training, I was able to return alive. Thank you so much.\u201d", "Jang Maldong\u2019s expression cracked at Seol Jihu\u2019s politeness. To be honest, he was extremely weak to attacks like this.", "\u201cNo\u2026 well\u2026 you put in a lot of effort\u2026.\u201d", "It was to the extent that a huge grin emerged on his usually solemn face.", "Soon, he quickly put on a straight face, then turned around with a dry cough.", "\u201cKuhum. You must be tired. Rest for now. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t leave. Seeing how he was hesitating and smacking his lips, Jang Maldong realized he still had something that he wanted to say.", "After a brief moment of silence, Seol Jihu spoke straightforwardly.", "\u201cI killed people.\u201d", "Hearing this sudden confession, one of Jang Maldong\u2019s eyebrows perked up.", "\u201c\u2026How many?\u201d", "\u201cTwo.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cBecause they ruined the Banquet I barely managed to restore.\u201d", "A conspicuous light flickered in Jang Maldong\u2019s eyes.", "\u201cYou\u2019re saying they deserved to die?\u201d", "\u201cIn my opinion, yes.\u201d", "\u201cThen that\u2019s fine.\u201d", "When Jang Maldong glossed over it so easily, Seol Jihu was taken aback.", "\u201cWhy are you surprised? If they deserved to die, you should kill them.\u201d", "Jang Maldong snorted.", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be sitting still if you let them off with a lame excuse. Well, I\u2019ll have to listen to the details to really know\u2026 but well done. If you encounter leopards who can\u2019t change their spots, just pull them out by their root.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head, thinking he did exactly that. Hearing Jang Maldong say this, he felt the emptiness inside him melt away.", "\u201cAnyways, you should go. I can\u2019t rest because you\u2019re standing there.\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes!\u201d", "Just as Seol Jihu was about to take his leave, the sound of footsteps climbing the staircase suddenly rang out.", "The one who threw open the door in the next moment wasn\u2019t Chohong or Hugo. It was Ian, with his white beard fluttering in the air.", "\u201cIan?\u201d", "\u201cMaldong!\u201d", "Ian shouted brightly, then waved his hand at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Seol!\u201d", "\u201cH-Hello.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu greeted him back, Ian placed his hand on the young man\u2019s shoulder.", "\u201cYou just came back from the Banquet?\u201d", "\u201cHow did you find out so quickly?\u201d", "Jang Maldong asked in surprise.", "\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the Kingdom\u2019s information network.\u201d", "After making a peace sign with his hand, Ian tilted his head up and laughed. He then grabbed Seol Jihu and Jang Maldong and forcefully pulled them up.", "\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d", "\u201cNow, now, let\u2019s go. Hurry!\u201d", "\u201cGo where?\u201d", "\u201cThe pub, of course. Do you have any idea how curious I was about this Banquet?\u201d", "The two bickered for a while, but Ian was the eventual victor.", "In the end, Ian dragged Seol Jihu and Jang Maldong to Eat, Drink, and Enjoy.", "*", "Once they arrived at the pub, Seol Jihu had to tell the long story.", "The entire time, Ian listened with keen interest and excitement. When Seol Jihu talked about Audrey Basler, he became angry and muttered, \u2018What a total bitch! But is she pretty?\u2019 And when he heard that Seol Jihu had beaten her up, he danced and said, \u2018Serves her right! But is she pretty?\u2019", "Then, when Seol Jihu explained how he turned the Banquet into a real banquet, Ian let out a shocked exclamation. Even Jang Maldong, who had been listening in with a stiff expression, nodded his head and smiled.", "As for Stage 3, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t talk about it in detail. Because of the restriction that was placed on him by the Seven Gods, even if he tried to talk, no words would come out of him.", "As the same thing had happened to everyone who passed Stage 3, Ian wasn\u2019t all too surprised.", "After about an hour or two of talking, the story of the Banquet came to a close.", "Seol Jihu watched Ian drinking a bottle of liquor joyously, then spoke.", "\u201c\u2026Master Ian, there\u2019s something I\u2019m really curious about.\u201d", "Ian bobbed his head, signaling the young man to go ahead.", "\u201cWhat do you know about the word \u2018destiny\u2019?\u201d", "Ian flinched and put down the liquor bottle.

I can\u2019t trust Synchronization 100%.\u201d", "When Ian handed Seol Jihu a pen and a piece of paper, Seol Jihu wrote what he could.", "\u201cDestiny (\u5bbf\u547d)\u2026. \u5bbf meaning \u2018constellations\u2019 and \u547d meaning \u2018to move\u2019.

If I were to interpret it my way, I would say it is surrendering oneself to fate.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was slightly confused. The way Ian put it, it sounded like fate couldn\u2019t be avoided.", "\u201cDon\u2019t make that face. In life, you\u2019ll come across multiple instances where you will have to surrender to fate. It will be thousands of times. Even in this moment.\u201d", "Seol Jihu still looked like he couldn\u2019t understand.", "\u201cYou might think fate is something amazing, but that\u2019s not the case at all.\u201d", "Ian smacked his lips.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that complicated. You and I are both humans, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cOnce we are born, it is our fate to live dozens of years and our fate to die once our lifespan ends. Can you go against this fate?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cExactly. That is why you can only surrender to it.\u201d", "Ian grinned.", "\u201cBut in order to live, humans have to eat and breathe, no?\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing.

We\u2019d die.\u201d", "Ian nodded hard enough to make his beard flutter.", "\u201cThis is the important part. At this moment\u2014\u201d", "Tang, tang! He continued as he pounded the wooden table.", "\u201cBy not breathing or eating, or in other words, by selecting one of these choices, we can meet one of our predetermined fates - life or death!\u201d", "Ian blurted out passionately, while Seol Jihu opened his mouth slightly.", "Although he didn\u2019t understand everything Ian said, one part was etched into this brain.", "That even if one had to surrender to fate, there was more than one fate to choose from.", "In other words\u2026.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it surprising if you think about it? That such a trivial choice can change your fate completely!\u201d", "Even a small choice could change the outcome.

Whether that be in the past, present, or the future.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re saying I should be careful with every little decision I make?\u201d", "Ian clicked his tongue.", "\u201cBoy! It\u2019s up to you to interpret what I say, but don\u2019t come to a conclusion so rashly!\u201d", "He stroked his beard and shrugged his shoulders.", "\u201cHuge destinies like life and death are usually placed toward the end of one\u2019s life. And life is long. Unlike in games, you can\u2019t see the ending just by making one or two choices.\u201d", "With that, Ian let out a hearty laugh.", "\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right.\u201d", "Seol Jihu agreed with him subconsciously.
