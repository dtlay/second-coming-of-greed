However, Little Chick did not give up. It kicked off the ground right away and violently pecked toward Seol Jihu, who was reaching out.", "A large hand flew across the sky like an arrow, and a sharp beak cut through the air.", "A fierce fight broke out. They sweated blood while exchanging several moves. They crushed the garden weeds as they rolled around, and small craters appeared in the dirt.", "A great war between a man and a bird sent the garden shaking. Though it seemed like there would be no end to it, the victor was decided in a split second.", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "The large hand succeeded in snatching the bird\u2019s body. Inside the devastated garden, the sweet taste of victory was handed to the human.", "\u201cKeuk! If only I had enough energy\u2026!\u201d", "Little Chick\u2019s beak shook in anger. Seol Jihu grinned and brought Little Chick up to his eye level.", "\u201cYou lost, right? Now, hand it over.\u201d", "Little Chick stopped glaring and blinked.", "\u201cWhat are you on about? Did something happen to your brain when you revived?\u201d", "\u201cWhat about you? Why did you attack me?\u201d", "\u201cNo reason. Looking at you just made me angry.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You little bastard.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was about to squeeze his left hand but instead, put his right hand in front of Little Chick.", "\u201cAnyway, hand it over. You said you would.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t think I forgot. I distinctly heard before I lost consciousness.\u201d", "Little Chick still seemed to be doubting whether Seol Jihu was out of his mind. However, after a moment of staring dazedly, it dropped its lower beak in a fluster.", "\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWell?\u201d", "Seol Jihu grinned with his mouth, protruding out like a monkey. Little Chick grunted, annoyed with Seol Jihu. It squirmed out of his hand, then shouted.", "\u201cWhen did I say that!?\u201d", "\u201cWhat, you\u2019re going back on your words now?\u201d", "Hearing this, Little Chick boldly put out its leg. This time, it was Seol Jihu\u2019s turn to be speechless.", "\u201cHmph, you took the fourth and fifth stage practically for free, and now you want the sixth and seventh stage too? Where\u2019d you drop your conscience?\u201d", "\u201cYou said you\u2019d unlock them!\u201d", "\u201cIf you go back alive! Did you go back alive? Huh!? You couldn\u2019t even climb a measly, little hill and collapsed\u2026!\u201d", "Seol Jihu fell silent. Now that he thought about it, Little Chick was right.", "\u201cBut the final battle is going to happen soon. I figured training with the sixth and seventh stages would help if I\u2019m going to fight the Parasite Queen\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu suddenly turned sad. Little Chick flinched\u2026", "\u201cCan\u2019t you see this? Hmm?\u201d", "Then he yelled while pointing at its forehead with its tiny wing.", "\u201cShouldn\u2019t you help me reach adulthood before asking me for this? How can I unlock anything when I don\u2019t have the means!?\u201d", "That was right as well. Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes rolled.", "\u201cThe contribution points I have might be a little tight\u2026 I do think it will be enough, though\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You just revived. You should take care of yourself and rest a little more. Why are you already cooking something up?\u201d", "\u201cWhat good would it do to wait? If we have to fight anyway, it\u2019s better to do it as soon as possible.\u201d", "\u201cHmm, that means the Parasites lost and retreated again\u2026. Well, given the nature of parasites, I guess it makes sense not to give them too much time\u2026.\u201d", "On a side note, Phi Sora was hiding behind a tree, sneaking glances and eavesdropping in on their conversation.", "\u2018\u2026What the hell are those guys doing?\u2019", "She had a dumbfounded expression. At first, the two of them were fighting like they wanted to kill each other. Now, they were having a serious conversation with grave looks.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know the details since I just woke up, but I can imagine what happened\u2026. Anyway, the sixth and seventh stages aren\u2019t so easy to master.\u201d", "\u201cI know.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you know? Starting from the sixth stage, you can\u2019t use the Authority you\u2019re granted off the bat. For the seventh stage, you have to be mindful of your physical state too\u2026.\u201d", "Little Chick furrowed its brows in the middle of talking. It was only then that it felt the divinity flowing out of Seol Jihu\u2019s body.", "\u201cYou\u2026 A-Anyway, you need time to get used to them!\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d", "Seol Jihu grinned.", "\u201cI\u2019ll have more than enough time.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the battle\u2019s right around the corner?\u201d", "\u201cYou just have to make time then.\u201d", "Seol Jihu winked.", "\u201cDo you want to come too?\u201d", "Hearing Seol Jihu\u2019s vague question, Little Chick tilted its head.", "*", "Seol Jihu spent the rest of the day peacefully in Seo Yuhui\u2019s arms and held a meeting the next morning. Before getting to the main agenda, there were a few things he needed to take care of.", "\u201cHow\u2019s Sinyoung doing?\u201d", "\u201cExtremely busy. Representative Yun Seora is running around day in and day out, taking care of matters on Earth and in Paradise\u2026. She has her work cut out for her.\u201d", "This wasn\u2019t surprising since every executive was executed.", "\u201cI was wondering why she wasn\u2019t picking up\u2026. I guess it will be hard to see her for a while then.\u201d", "\u201cRepresentative Yun Seora, you mean? Why?\u201d", "\u201cI wanted to thank her. It was Miss Yun Seora who acquired a Royal Oath, right?\u201d", "Kim Hannah nodded.", "\u201cSince both sides are busy right now, maybe you can express your gratitude by sending the Federation\u2019s promised aid to Scheherazade first. That should be more than enough.\u201d", "\u201cAren\u2019t other organizations working with them?\u201d", "\u201cThey were before the war. Now it\u2019s a total mess. Eva is the only city that isn\u2019t in total ruins.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201c\u2026I guess it can\u2019t be helped then. Do that. I\u2019d still like to meet her later, though.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll try to leave her a note. By the way, what about the Triads?\u201d", "\u201cI talked with Mister Hao Win on the phone for a bit on Earth. He said he\u2019s busy at the moment but would be down to grab drinks once the Parasite Queen\u2019s defeated.\u201d", "Kim Hannah chuckled.", "\u201cSo, you\u2019re finally learning the ropes, calling them first and all.\u201d", "\u201cOf course. If it weren\u2019t for the Triads helping me, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s good that you know. They stopped you from jumping out of the window as soon as you revived. Of course you should pay them back.\u201d", "Seol Jihu glared at Kim Hannah. She put on an air of innocence and began to jot something down on a piece of paper, humming.", "\u2018It\u2019s not my fault you kicked Master\u2026\u2019", "Judging by the subtle jabs she was making, she must still be angry about what happened a few days ago.", "\u201cOh yeah, is your T doing well?\u201d", "\u201cYes, she got a little dirty, so I made her take a bath, and now she\u2019s sleeping under the sun.\u201d", "\u201cWhat a shame. I wanted to see her again too.\u201d", "\u201cIt might be a little difficult right now. I do have Black Lace with me here. Do you want to see her instead?\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I can just see T tomorrow.\u201d", "\u201cOh my, but tomorrow is going to be Fish Net\u2019s day.\u201d", "Kim Hannah played along without batting an eye. It seemed she had gotten used to Seol Jihu\u2019s antics.", "Seol Jihu scratched his head awkwardly.", "\u2018Anyway, I\u2019ll leave the rest to Kim Hannah\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu swept his bangs up, then blinked. He called everyone to the office, but\u2026", "\u201c?\u201d", "For some reason, everyone was staring fixedly at him or laughing. For example, Chohong was grinning with her back against the wall, Phi Sora was chuckling in front of the desk, and Eun Yuri was giving him a piercing look.", "Seol Jihu felt like he was missing something. Beside Seo Yuhui, who was hugging his head from behind his chair with her head on top of his, Teresa was sitting crossed-legged at the edge of his desk, sending him seductive looks, and a small weight could be felt on his left leg since a while ago.", "\u201cWhat are you doing here, Your Majesty?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria tilted her head up. She was leaning on Seol Jihu\u2019s leg, reading a book.", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t the only one who was taken aback. Baek Haeju was the same. She looked like someone who only expected to see one thieving cat but saw six predators eyeing the same prey.", "Of course, the prey himself was oblivious to all this. He was rummaging through his pocket, trying to bring up the main topic.", "\u201cAs you all know, we will join hands with the Federation and launch an attack into the Parasite\u2019s territory.\u201d", "This would be the first time in history that the humans and the foreign races invade the Empire\u2019s territory.", "\u201cThere\u2019s still some time before then\u2026 but we can\u2019t say that we\u2019re necessarily in an advantageous position. Although now only half of the Army Commanders remain, the Parasites can\u2019t be considered gravely hurt as long as the Parasite Queen is alive and well.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke about this heavy topic in a light tone before taking out the item he prepared.", "\u201cSince our next battle will be in the Empire\u2019s territory, the Parasite Queen is sure to appear in full force. This will be the final battle that decides the fate of the three forces, so\u2026.\u201d", "Tak, tak, tak! He shook a pouch, and three faintly shining orbs fell to the table.", "\u201cWe should boost our strength in preparation for that battle.\u201d", "Diligence, Charity, and Temperance. Everyone\u2019s eyes widened as they stared at these three divinities.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s plan was simple. It was to offer the divinities in exchange for contribution points and using Divine Wishes to help accelerate his teammates\u2019 growth.", "Divine Wishes were only omnipotent when it came to things that the Seven Sins could grant, but there was a clear limit. If the maximum power of a wish were equivalent to ten points, then the cost to revive an Earthling would also be ten points. In this case, a single Divine Wish would only be able to revive one person.", "But by the same logic, one would be able to ask for multiple wishes using a single Divine Wish. For example, one could ask for a weapon and an armor, each costing five points.", "And so, the first thing Seol Jihu checked was how close everyone was to being promoted. As they fought against the Parasites for a month since the second Imperial Oath Expedition, he expected them to have amassed a decent amount of experience and contribution points.", "Even in reality, Yi Sungjin was promoted to Level 4, and Yi Seol-Ah was promoted to a High Ranker. Not only that, Eun Yuri, who made significant contributions in the war, skipped two levels to become Level 6.", "Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t anyone who was promoted to a Unique Ranker. Valhalla had several Level 6s, but most lacked contribution points needed for the promotion. Apparently, a few only fell short by a few points\u2026", "\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t care. Helping people level up when they were at 70 to 80 percent contribution point status would be a lot different than someone at zero percent status. Not to mention, most of them didn\u2019t need to go through promotion exams.", "And so, Seol Jihu planned to separate his comrades into three groups and fill up the contribution points they lacked for promotions using a wish.", "To be more precise, Baek Haeju and Seo Yuhui were in the first group. As they already amassed a lot of contribution points, Kazuki was just barely able to fit in as well.", "The second group consisted of Chung Chohong, Teresa, and Phi Sora. As they missed out on their promotions just barely, the Divine Wish still had some wish power left, so Marcel Ghionea and Hugo could be included as well.", "The third group consisted of Eun Yuri, Yi Seol-Ah, and Yi Sungjin.", "These were the groups Seol Jihu came up with after much deliberation. It was a shame he had to leave Hoshino Urara out, but there was nowhere to fit her into even if he took out Marcel Ghionea and Hugo.", "He also debated heavily between Yi Seol-Ah and Oh Rahee, but in the end, he decided on the former. It would have been great if they both could level up, but it just wasn\u2019t possible both ways.", "After hearing his explanation, Valhalla\u2019s members showed dumbstruck faces.", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I thought you guys would be happy.\u201d", "Eun Yuri stared at the divinities before looking up at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cDaddy?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora stepped up.", "\u201cObviously, that\u2019s good for us\u2026. I\u2019m sure everyone understands what you\u2019re saying\u2026. It\u2019s just\u2026. You know\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cDo I really need to spell it out for you!? You\u2019re the one who obtained those divinities, but rather than spending them for yourself, you\u2019re saying you\u2019d take care of us\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora bit her lip.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you want to be promoted to Level 10?\u201d", "\u201cLevel 10? Why would I?\u201d", "Seol Jihu snorted.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like leveling up will change anything for me.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change anything?\u201d", "\u201cNope. Not besides my class name.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke firmly.", "\u201cLeveling up will get me 10 ability points. Even if I add the points I have now, it will only be enough to raise my Luck stat. What\u2019s the point in a Warrior having high Luck stat?\u201d", "Phi Sora blinked. As she believed Pinnacle was the highest rank a physical stat could reach, she did not understand what Seol Jihu was talking about.", "\u201cYou might not know this, Miss Phi Sora, but purely in terms of the physical level, I can easily surpass a Level 10.\u201d", "\u201cW-What?\u201d", "\u201cI saved the Divine Elixirs until the end. And after I revived, I realized my Endurance, Agility, and Mana stat increased again\u2026. I can\u2019t really quantify it, but I should be around Level 14 or 15 range.\u201d", "Seol Jihu then added, \u201cPurely in terms of physical level.\u201d", "Maria also murmured, \u201cI knew sitting on it was the right move\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu ignored her and continued.", "\u201cI judged that it would be better if you all use the points instead of me. That\u2019s all.\u201d", "He emphasized the last point as if he would not accept any objections. Of course, he didn\u2019t mention the real reason, which was unnecessarily risking danger when he was satisfied with his current class name.", "\u201cWe have no reason to refuse if that\u2019s the case, but\u2026\u201d", "Chohong, who was leaning on the wall with her arms crossed, spoke.", "\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to be comfortable with it. You\u2019re saying I will become a Level 7, right?\u201d", "\u201cYep.\u201d", "\u201cThen I won\u2019t have any contribution points left after becoming a Unique Ranker. Even if I gain ability points to raise my physical level, I won\u2019t be able to learn any skills.\u201d", "She was saying that rather than spreading thin, he should focus on a few elites.", "She wasn\u2019t necessarily wrong either.", "\u201cYou can learn the skills on your own.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Chohong furrowed her brows.", "\u201cWhat are you talking about? There are only two months before the date of the march, so how would we\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll show you a way to turn 60 days into 600 days.\u201d", "Hearing this, Chohong became speechless.", "\u201cHow?\u201d", "Teresa asked, leaning closer to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWell, let me just say this is another use of the Divine Wish.\u201d", "\u201cOh, my. You have even more Divine Wishes?\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019ll be with my own contribution points. I had some left over after leveling up, and I even killed two Army Commanders after that.\u201d", "Teresa did a double-take. Now that she thought about it, it was Seol Jihu who killed Sung Shihyun and stopped Abhorrent Charity\u2019s self-destruction.", "\u201cAlright, that\u2019s all I wanted to tell everyone. I\u2019ll explain the rest later.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled and got up.", "\u201cI gotta go somewhere.\u201d", "*", "After the meeting, Seol Jihu loitered around Valhalla\u2019s building.", "[Stop~]", "\u201cKking!\u201d", "[Stop right there~!]", "\u201cKking! Kking!\u201d", "He found Flone playing tag with the little fuzzballs and brought her to a quiet place to talk.", "\u201cFlone, do you remember the Pagoda of Dreams Expedition?\u201d", "[Yeah! Why do you ask?]", "Flone looked confused.", "\u201cThink about it. Who would have thought that the Stele of Evaluation we found would help protect the World Tree?\u201d", "Before going back home after the expedition, Seol Jihu had activated his Nine Eyes.

If not for us, she might have been trapped inside that forest forever.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t know why the forest had glowed blue back then, but he finally understood after the Tigol Fortress War. What was important was that Seol Jihu knew of another place that was a mix of yellow and blue.", "\u201cThis means that our choices can change the fate of others. Not only that of the living but also that of the dead.\u201d", "[O-Okay\u2026]", "Flone seemed focused but completely confused.", "\u201cDo you remember the ancient emperor\u2019s villa?\u201d", "[Of course.]", "\u201cI thought about how to utilize that place, and I think I finally got it.
