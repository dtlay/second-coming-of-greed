Blazing like flames from a gas stove, the ghostly lights flew over like tiny comets.", "Although Seol Jihu wanted to observe them a bit more\u2014", "Crackle! With the scorching fire nearly touching him, Seol Jihu stabbed forward with his tightly gripped spear.", "\u201c!\u201d", "Then, he immediately paused in hesitation. It would be normal to feel the spear blade penetrating something, but no such sensation was transmitted to his palms.", "But he expected as much since he was stabbing a gaseous lifeform. The reason he paused was because the enemy froze as soon as his spear blade pierced it.", "[Kirrrrrr! Kirrrrr!]", "Unable to move an inch, the will o\u2019 wisp let out a bizarre cry while convulsing painfully.", "On closer inspection, holy energy could be seen flowing out of the evil-exterminating weapon, the Spear of Purity, and disturbing the will o\u2019 wisp\u2019s insides.", "\u2018Don\u2019t tell me.\u2019", "Thinking what if, Seol Jihu immediately roused the anti-evil energy.", "Then, as a golden current violently gushed out of the spear tip, a sound akin to a balloon-popping boom struck his ears.", "[Kiaaaa\u2026. Kiaaaa\u2026.]", "The blue gaseous lifeform exploded, its color dimming in an instant.", "The will o\u2019 wisp seemed to be vanishing just like that, but then it disappeared into the horizon as if it was sucked in by something unknown.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed, seeing the lifeform disappearing in an instant.", "\u2018What was that?\u2019", "He couldn\u2019t help but think that it was too easy. However, his hesitation didn\u2019t last long. Not only was he still in the midst of battle, but another will o\u2019 wisp had also flown toward him.", "Seol Jihu pulled his upper body back and threw his arm up. As the spear blade emitting a golden light vertically swept the will o\u2019 wisp, it was split in half and melted down without uttering its death throe.", "Immediately afterward, four will o\u2019 wisps simultaneously rushed at him from four directions, but the result was no different. When Seol Jihu swung his spear, they exploded with no resistance. It was really a piece of cake.", "What was surprising was that Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t the only one overwhelming the enemy. Chohong and Hugo were also pushing the enemy back, swinging the Thorn of Steel radiating white light and an axe carrying holy energy, respectively.", "While they weren\u2019t overwhelming the enemy like Seol Jihu, they were fighting them off with no difficulties.", "Phi Sora had even run into the midst of the enemy forces and was showing off a sword dance in high spirits. As a sword scattering flames danced freely in all directions, any will o\u2019 wisp that was touched by it was quickly devoured by the flames.", "With High Rankers and even a Level 4 doing so well, there was no need to say anything about the higher leveled combatants.", "The expedition team subjugated the enemy forces in an instant, and the battle ended earlier than anyone expected.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Aren\u2019t these guys too weak?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, that was too easy.\u201d", "Chohong and Hugo, who had a good exercise, spoke with a laugh as they wiped their sweats.", "They were rather nervous before the fight, but with such an easy victory in their first battle, they were overjoyed.", "Seol Jihu kept silent as he was about to say something. Subjugating the enemy wasn\u2019t a bad thing, and morale was an important aspect of any battle. He kept quiet, not wanting to ruin the festive mood, but it wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t suspicious of the situation.", "Some of the others seemed to be thinking the same thing as Agnes, Oh Rahee, and a couple of others were also silently in deep thought.", "\u201cNightshades.\u201d", "Philip Muller calmly spoke up.", "\u201cThey\u2019re Spirit Creatures[1] that subsist off of yin or negative energy.\u201d", "\u201cYou mean the guys we just fought?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s just one thing\u2026\u201d", "Philip Muller trailed off, then smacked his lips.", "\u201cSomething\u2019s strange.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cI assumed there would be at least one Army Commander in the Spirit Realm.

From what we know, Raging Temperance is from the Mythical Beast race, while Twisted Kindness is the last member of the Dragon race.\u201d", "Philip Muller continued.", "\u201cBut the Spirit Creatures you just saw are normally from the Spiritual Dimension. They have nothing to do with Mythical Beasts or Dragons.\u201d", "In other words, a race that should have no connection with the invading Army Commanders were in the Spirit Realm.", "\u201cWhy would that be\u2026?\u201d", "This wasn\u2019t so unacceptable given the Parasites\u2019 uniqueness as a species, but there were definitely more than one or two suspicious points.", "As Spirit Creatures didn\u2019t have physical bodies, it was hard to say they were a part of the Corpse Army, and they couldn\u2019t be considered a reproductive species birthed by mother species for the same reason.", "In that case, they had to be the army under the banner of an Army Commander.", "\u201cWhat are the chances that there is another Army Commander here?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s Exploding Patience who is also a Spirit Creature, but I heard her army consists entirely of Banshees. I\u2019ve never heard of her leading an army of Nightshades.\u201d", "As Philip Muller explained, Seol Jihu\u2019s expression turned complicated.", "\u2018It really is strange\u2026\u2019", "\u201cBut it isn\u2019t as if I\u2019m out of guesses.\u201d", "Philip Muller suddenly lowered his volume and whispered.", "\u201cThough there\u2019s no way to be sure, I heard something from the previous Star of Sloth.\u201d", "\u201cThe previous Star of Sloth?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m talking about the Executor who preceded Taciana Cinzia.\u201d", "Philip Muller continued.", "\u201cAfter becoming an Executor, he fought the Fourth Army Commander once. He barely escaped death and came back. That was when he said that Raging Temperance was a Unicorn.\u201d", "\u201cUnicorn\u2026\u201d", "\u201cHere\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s true that Unicorns are of the Mythical Beast race, but they still have nothing to do with the Spiritual Dimension.\u201d", "It was at this moment that Seol Jihu realized Philip Muller\u2019s guess and what he was trying to say.", "\u201cYou\u2019re saying the identity of Raging Temperance might have changed.\u201d", "\u201cThat could be it, or there might be something we don\u2019t quite understand. We have to be open to all possibilities.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bit his lip as something Gabriel told him in the past suddenly crossed his mind.", "\u2018A new card\u2026\u2019", "Survival of the fittest. It was a simple concept. If the Parasite Queen found a stronger race, there was nothing holding her back from changing out one of the Commanders.", "In any case, nothing was confirmed yet. They couldn\u2019t jump to any conclusions. They would have to see with their own eyes to be sure.", "\u201cI know you\u2019re talking, but\u2026\u201d", "At that moment, the silently-listening Kazuki cut in between them. He raised his finger and pointed to the front. A small group of Spirits that survived the Nightshades\u2019 attack was murmuring among themselves.", "[Humans? Aren\u2019t they humans?]", "[No way! How can humans enter this world\u2026!]", "Seol Jihu swallowed his saliva. Each of the Spirits shone in one of the five colors, having a wide variety of appearances ranging from animals to a small girl. They were all small. Frankly, they didn\u2019t look all that powerful.", "[They defeated those bastards! Maybe they\u2019re here to help!]", "[I might believe that if they were Sky Fairies. But humans?]", "[But it\u2019s true they helped! They saved us!]", "[Wait, there\u2019s an aura of a Spirit I\u2019ve never felt before\u2026]", "Judging by the way they were talking among themselves, it was obvious that they were young. Still, they should be able to explain the Spirit Realm\u2019s current state.", "When Seol Jihu walked forward, the Spirits\u2019 gazes all turned toward him. Looking up with unbridled eyes\u2026", "[Help us!][Please help!][Save the Kings!][Please save our world!]", "They began to chatter in front of his foot.", "As Seol Jihu stood in a fluster from the Spirits pulling on his leg, he flinched feeling something poking his neck.", "\u201cPartner.\u201d", "Little Chick was standing on his shoulder before he noticed.", "\u201cLet me talk to these younguns.\u201d", "\u201cY-You\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cUn. I\u2019m curious about a few things.\u201d", "Seol Jihu thought for a moment before nodding his head. Since Little Chick was also a Spirit, it should have an easier time talking with the Spirits.", "Little Chick jumped down once it received Seol Jihu\u2019s permission. As soon as it landed on the ground, the pestering Spirits were all shocked.", "[Eh? Who\u2019s this?]", "\u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019m a Spirit, just like you.\u201d", "[But I\u2019ve never seen a Spirit like you\u2026]", "\u201cThat\u2019s obvious. That\u2019s the way it should be. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if you younguns knew about me.\u201d", "[Eeh? This smell\u2026 it\u2019s the smell of the five elements and even the sealed light and darkness\u2026 Just who are you?]", "\u201cQuiet! Even your Kings wouldn\u2019t dare to talk to me that way! A low-ranked Spirit should talk respectfully when speaking with their elders!\u201d", "When Little Chick raised its voice, the Spirits immediately quit chattering. They must have felt the difference in their leagues as they all looked dejected.", "\u201c\u2026Anyway, I have a few questions to ask you all.\u201d", "Little Chick cleared its throat and spoke.", "\u201cIf you haven\u2019t realized already, these humans are reinforcements sent by the Sky Fairies to save our world. Meaning, we are allies.\u201d", "Hearing this, the Spirits\u2019 complexions brightened.", "\u201cBut we just got here, so we know nothing about the details. Every second of every minute counts. Answer to the best of your abilities, got it?\u201d", "[U-Un!]", "\u201cGood. First\u2014 where are the Spirit Kings?\u201d", "[\u2026.]", "\u201cI can feel them, but it\u2019s too faint. Just what the hell happened for the Spirit Realm to turn out like this?\u201d", "[\u2026They were captured.]", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "When a Spirit retorted in a dejected voice, Little Chick furrowed its brows instantly.", "\u201cCaptured? Ifrit, Aqua, Terra, Ea, and Sylphid. All five were captured?\u201d", "[Uun. The enemy they were fighting was too scary\u2026]", "Sobs were heard from the small Spirits. Little Chick let out a dumbfounded laugh, then gritted its teeth.", "\u201cDamn it, then what about the two Spirit Lords?\u201d", "[?]", "\u201cI\u2019m talking about Ophin\u00fc Odor and Diffidem Odor.\u201d", "[We\u2026 don\u2019t know. We were told we can\u2019t unseal them so recklessly\u2026]", "\u201cIdiots!\u201d", "Little Chick burst out before the Spirit finished.", "\u201cThose shit-for-brain bastards! Even in such a situation\u2026!\u201d", "Its short hair stood on ends as it shook furiously.", "\u201c\u2026Partner.\u201d", "After muttering with a heavy pant, Little Chick turned its head and looked up at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cThe situation is worse than we expected. If it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d like the team to prioritize rescuing the Spirit Kings.\u201d", "Rescuing the Spirit Kings. There was no problem doing it if it would help with saving the Spirit Realm, but Seol Jihu asked regardless.", "\u201cAre they alive?\u201d", "\u201cI can feel them.\u201d", "Little Chick clicked its tongue and spoke.", "\u201cSpirits are mortal existences, but they don\u2019t return to nothingness after death. Instead, they return to the World Tree and reincarnate. You can think of it as an eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.\u201d", "\u201cBut the World Tree is\u2014\u201d", "\u201cDead. Since this cycle is broken, Spirits should disappear when they die. That should be the case, but\u2026\u201d", "Little Chick paused before sighing.", "\u201cBut\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cThe Spirit Kings that were captured long ago aren\u2019t dead yet. It\u2019s also strange that they\u2019re all in the same place. I have a bad feeling about this. If left alone, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d", "Little Chick trailed off, but Seol Jihu understood what it was trying to say.", "\u2018Well\u2026 I don\u2019t see why not.\u2019", "He also had a feeling that something terrible would happen if the Spirit Kings were left in the enemy\u2019s hands. On the other hand, rescuing them quickly and receiving their help seemed to be a good idea.", "As kings of a world, the Spirit Kings should be helpful in fighting the Commanders.", "\u201cAlright. Do you know where they are?\u201d", "\u201cI do. It\u2019s where the World Tree is.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes lit up.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go. There\u2019s no need to delay then.\u201d", "[Let\u2019s go together!]", "[We\u2019ll help too!]", "Hearing Seol Jihu\u2019s reply to Little Chick, the young Spirits eagerly spoke. However, Little Chick snorted and refused adamantly.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You twerps can\u2019t even handle a single Spirit Creature\u2026\u201d", "[Still!]", "\u201cListen to me. I\u2019m not telling you to just sit here and do nothing. I\u2019m sure you have your circumstances, but you must have been traveling to save the Spirit Kings because you were pushed to a corner and didn\u2019t have any other choice.\u201d", "The Spirits nodded carefully.", "\u201c\u2026Tsk, if the lowest-rank and low-rank Spirits are doing this, it\u2019s easy to see what happened to the higher-ranked guys.\u201d", "Little Chick spoke regretfully.", "\u201cDragging this out will only put the enemies in a more advantageous position. It\u2019s a do or die situation now. You guys spread out and gather everyone.\u201d", "[Gather everyone?]", "\u201cThere must be other remnant groups in hiding. Bring them with you to the fight. At the very least, you can act as our shields. Even if you die, you\u2019ll come back to life once the World Tree revives.\u201d", "[You can resurrect World Tree-nim!?]", "\u201cI don\u2019t have time to sit around and explain. Just do as I say. This is a pressing matter. The longer you guys take, the smaller the chances get of us saving the Spirit Kings. Got that?\u201d", "Little Chick emphasized the urgency of the matter multiple times, and the Spirits finally looked convinced.", "[Got it! Then we\u2019ll meet up at the World Tree?]", "[We\u2019ll hurry and bring as many Spirits as we can!]", "It wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to ask for protection since they could be ambushed again. Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but feel a little proud seeing the little guys courageously scattering in all directions.", "\u2018\u2026No.\u2019", "Perhaps this was only natural. Unable to see any hope for the future, they were charging forward with their lives on the line out of pure desperation. Since a lifeline was suddenly thrown at them from the sky, it made sense for them to grab onto it with all their might.", "\u2018If only Earthlings were half as courageous and resolute as them\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu chuckled before shaking the thought off his head.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll take the lead, partner.\u201d", "The expedition team began to march with Little Chick at the head.

Just like how their first battle ended with an easy victory.", "Of course, he wasn\u2019t all that optimistic. It would be great if everything went smoothly like a sailboat following a fair wind, but the Parasites weren\u2019t fools that could be looked down on.", "\u2018I doubt they\u2019d stay still\u2026\u2019", "Just as he thought that\u2014", "[I\u2026]", "Suddenly\u2014", "[I have a theory I\u2019ve kept to myself.]", "[I haven\u2019t said it until now because it was all a conjecture.]", "Seol Jihu remembered the words Ian spoke before he died.", "[Seol.
