It sounded like someone quietly crying.", "And following the sound to its source, his suspicion was proven right.", "He could see a small girl crouching behind a large rock.", "Yi Seol-Ah was quietly sobbing with her hands clasped against her mouth.", "She looked like she was desperately holding back her tears, but big drops fell from her deer-like eyes whenever she hiccupped.", "Seol Jihu put his hands in his pockets and quietly watched.", "He could guess why she was crying without even asking her. Jang Maldong\u2019s training method was to push a person to his or her limits before making them overcome it, so it could only be hard and painful.", "There was nothing anyone could do but curse Jang Maldong for being evil during his training sessions. It explained why Chohong and Hugo so desperately prayed for his afterlife.", "Seol Jihu himself had experienced it, so he could sympathize with what she was going through.", "But as much as he expressed his sincere thanks to Jang Maldong the moment he came back from the Banquet, he knew how significant the process was.", "'Hmm.'", "Now that he thought about it, he hadn\u2019t been able to pay her much attention after going through the trouble of recruiting her because of his own training.", "While enduring the training was entirely up to the siblings, he could have at least talked with them for a minute or two\u2026", "Becoming apologetic after realizing that, Seol Jihu pulled his hands out of his pockets and walked towards her.", "He had intended to quietly approach her, but forgetting the logs tied to him, he ended up making a loud noise.", "Yi Seol-Ah raised her head in surprise.", "\"O-Orabeo-nim?\u201d", "\"Ah!\"", "Seol Jihu bitterly smiled and quickly began untying the rope around him.", "Yi Seol-Ah watched him drop the practically broken logs and sandbags with tired eyes before quickly hanging her head down when Seol Jihu plopped down next to her.", "She didn\u2019t want to show him her crying face.", "\"I-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "\"What\u2019s there to be sorry for?\"", "\"Still\u2026 You\u2019ve brought me all the way here, but I\u2019m just pathetically crying\u2026\u201d", "Hearing her speak with a sinking voice, Seol Jihu realized that she had an obsession of some sort.", "Dryly smacking his lips, Seol Jihu took out a cigarette and placed it in his mouth.", "\"You can cry when you\u2019re tired. Even I cried.\u201d", "\"Orabeo-nim too?\u201d", "\"Yeah. For your information, crybaby is one of my nicknames.\u201d", "Even though it wasn\u2019t something to be proud of, Seol Jihu made a V-sign with his hand and beamed.", "Yi Seol-Ah made an expression of disbelief.", "\"You\u2019re just trying to cheer me up\u2026\u201d", "\"No way. If you really think I\u2019m lying then go ask Master.\u201d", "\"\u2026Really?\"", "\u201cYeah. Was it when I was going up the hill in front of the cave? I was so tired that I couldn\u2019t take a single step further, but Master yelled \u2018Hurry up! Are you going to give up like this?\u2019 at me. I teared up that moment.\u201d", "\"So what did you do?\u201d", "\u201cI clenched my teeth and trudged up with all I had. The second I collapsed, a notification informing me that my strength increased popped up.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled as he recalled that day before lighting his cigarette. Yi Seol-Ah opened her mouth slightly.", "She knew how hard it was to increase a person\u2019s physical level through pure training, since she, too, had trained before without missing a single day.", "\u201cMaster\u2019s training sessions are just like that. Even though he pushes you to the brink of death, you don\u2019t actually die. It\u2019s only to the point where you begin to lament \u2018I\u2019m going to die at this rate.\u2019\u201d", "Seol Jihu turned to look at Yi Seol-Ah with a slightly serious face.", "\u201cAnd it\u2019s all up to you to surpass your limit when that moment comes.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah attentively listened, engraving his precious advice in her heart. Seol Jihu grinned before blowing out the smoke.", "\u201cWell I\u2019ve said this and that but\u2026 The point is that you can cry when you\u2019re tired. Just cry out everything until your heart feels refreshed.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah wiped her tears with the back of her hands and let out a bright smile.", "\"Sora sunbae\u2019s words were true.\u201d", "\"Miss Phi Sora?\"", "\"Yes. I\u2019ve actually been caught crying a few days ago, too.\u201d", "\"What did that woman say to you? Did she do that Bitching Time again?\u201d", "\"N-no.\"", "Yi Seol-Ah shook her head. After scratching her cheek with her finger, she crossed her arms.", "And as if she was imitating someone, she squinted her eyes in a haughty fashion.", "\u201cWell, fine. I\u2019m not one to talk since I cried too\u2026 and she left just like that.\u201d", "\"Wow! Even Miss Phi Sora?\"", "\"Why?\"", "\"Ah. The truth is\u2026\u201d", "It was something Seol Jihu had only found out recently, but Agnes, too, was said to have cried after receiving Jang Maldong\u2019s guidance for only a single day.", "And of course, Kazuki who told him this, also cried after a day.", "And when he told her about Chohong who screamed like crazy before rushing at Jang Maldong, threatening to kill him, Yi Seol-Ah broke out into laughter, clapping her hands.", "Seeing her feel better, Seol Jihu extinguished his cigarette and rose up from his seat.", "\u201cMaster might be harsh when he\u2019s training, but he has high expectations from you.\"", "\"Really?\"", "\"Yeah. And so do I.\u201d", "Seol Jihu continued as he put on the sandbags and tied the rope around his waist.", "\u201cGrow up fast. I\u2019d like for us to do missions and go out on expeditions together.\u201d", "\"Orabeo-nim\u2026\"", "There was a saying that a randomly thrown stone might kill a frog. Not knowing how each and every one of his words would impact her, Seol Jihu tightly tied the rope and gave her final words of encouragement.", "\"I have a feeling you and I will work well together.\u201d", "He sent her a wink.", "\"Now then, do your best.\"", "After those words, he resumed his training.", "Yi Seol-Ah stared at the back of Seol Jihu gradually growing farther away with a slight blush on her face.", "That he had high expectations from her\u2026 that he wanted to do things with her. Seol Jihu\u2019s words remained in her mind, causing her heart to flutter.", "Yi Seol-Ah immediately stood up.", "\"My limits\u2026\"", "She still had red eyes, but after having her motivation reignited, her eyes contained a new sparkle.", "Yi Seol-Ah clenched both of her fists.", "And at that moment.", "\"Break through my limits. Break through my limits!\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah\u2019s growth direction was determined.", "*", "Sometime in the evening, Phi Sora approached Seol Jihu.", "\u201cHere, take this.\u201d", "What Phi Sora passed to him was a communication crystal. The faint light coming from it indicated that there was an incoming call.", "\u201cOoh. Why are you being so nice to me all of a sudden?\u201d", "\"Grandpa told me to give it to you. Don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d", "Coldly replying, Phi Sora left with sassy steps.", "\u2018Why did that woman come here anyways\u2026?\u2019", "She obviously wasn\u2019t here to train. She didn\u2019t look like she particularly had anything to do either.", "After tilting his head in confusion, Seol Jihu let a bit of his mana flow into the crystal.", "And a moment later, light spilled out, showing an image of Chohong and Hugo grinning cheekily.", "\u2014Yo! You rolling well?", "\u2014Look at what we\u2019re eating!", "Hugo teased him, waving the meat and liquor he was holding in front of him. After silently staring back, Seol Jihu angled the crystal to show him a glimpse of Seo Yuhui quietly looking up at the sky not far away.", "Hugo screamed.", "\u2014Whaaaaat!? W-What\u2019s going on? Why is the person destined to be my future wife over there?", "\"She had business to do on the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain. Hearing that we were coming here, she decided to tag along.\u201d", "\u2014Come oooon! You should have told me!", "\"The two of you ran off. How could I tell you when I couldn\u2019t even find you?\u201d", "\u2014Aaaahhh! Nooo!", "Hugo screamed in despair, disappearing from the screen.", "\u2014 \u2026What happened?", "It was an unfamiliar sight seeing Chohong\u2019s frosty face. Then suddenly, she flung her hair back and spoke.", "\u2014Whatever\u2026 I called you because\u2026", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened after hearing out Chohong.", "\u2014We were surprised too. A dude we thought was dead suddenly showed up asking if we knew anyone that had been to the Forest of Denial alone.", "\u201cIt seems like he was talking about me\u2026 but what would he find me for?\u201d", "\u2014I don\u2019t know either. I told him about you and that you weren\u2019t here at the moment. But after asking where you went, he suddenly dashed off.", "Chohong shrugged.", "\u2014He was an interesting guy. His tracking abilities are known to be terrible, so he even hired another Archer to look for you.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face became complicated. It was because he couldn\u2019t think of a reason that the unknown person would look for him so desperately.", "\u2014I don\u2019t know what happened exactly but\u2026 Hey! Try to talk it out with him.\u201d", "\"About what?\"", "\u2014Recruitment! Ghio, that guy! He\u2019s a Level 4 Archer.\u201d", "\"Ghio? Level 4?\"", "\u2014Don\u2019t underestimate a Level 4. He was once evaluated to be the next talent to continue the line of Haramarks\u2019s elite Archers, Dylan and Kazuki. And he still is.", "Seol Jihu stared at the crystal with a questioning look. It was the first time he had seen the unsociable Chohong fervently praise another human being.", "\u2014He already has a nickname for himself. Even Dylan wanted to recruit him before, you know? Well, he was immediately turned down though.", "\"Dylan did?\"", "\u2014Yeah. He\u2019s not so good with scouting, but his insane combat prowess is more than enough to overcome his shortcomings. He\u2019s a rather rare type among Archers.", "\u201cWell. I think I\u2019ll have to personally see him first. And besides, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll join even if I ask him to.\u201d", "Chohong grinned.", "\u2014It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know that. I mean, what does he lack that he\u2019ll want to join Carpe Diem\u2026 I do know that he\u2019s probably being flooded with recruitment requests at the moment.", "\"Why?\"", "\u2014His original team was torn apart during a war with the Parasites. And it seems like he lost the rest of his teammates recently. He has no one left now.", "\"Hmm.\"", "\u2014Anyways, just try asking. You never know, right? If by chance you do recruit Ghio, then it will probably only be a matter of time before Carpe Diem regains its former glory.", "And after saying, \u2018Well, good luck! And don\u2019t come back too early!\u2019, Chohong hung up.", "'Ghio\u2026 Ghio\u2026?'", "Seol Jihu tilted his head in confusion at the unfamiliar name.", "But since he was told that Ghio was coming to him, he resumed his training.", "And the next morning. An unknown visitor came looking for him just like Chohong said.", "Seol Jihu, who had been training on the peak just in case, discovered a person walking around the woods off in the distance and decided to approach him.", "A tall, nimble man armed with sculpted muscles sent a sharp gaze the moment Seol Jihu drew near.", "\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d", "A husky voice rang out.", "\"Is there a person named Seol nearby?\u201d", "\"That would be me.\"", "Seol Jihu immediately answered, having been informed beforehand.", "A glint flashed across the man\u2019s intense grey eyes.", "\"\u2026Finally.\"", "After quietly muttering to himself, he let out a short breath.", "Seol Jihu carefully observed the man. There were traces hinting that he had wandered for a while, implying that he had separated from his guide some time back.", "His equipment looked a bit lacking, but judging from the bow he was holding, he was undoubtedly an Archer.", "His neatly combed ash-grey hair, which looked like it received volumizing treatment, along with the defined sideburn, gave him a striking impression.", "\u2018He\u2019s handsome.'", "If Kazuki was a cold man from the city, then this man who carried a noble atmosphere around him was a nobleman of the medieval times.", "But he had too many conspicuous scars to say he was just a boy raised in a rich house.", "If Kazuki was a bird of prey in the skies, then this man was a solitary white wolf wandering around a snowfield.", "But most importantly, the man\u2019s wary eyes that contained an unconcealable hatred towards something, made his face look dark and frosty.", "\"Are you the one called Ghio\u2026?", "The man flinched before opening his mouth.", "\"\u2026So you knew. If it\u2019s not rude, may I ask a few questions?\u201d", "As his manners could not have been more polite, Seol Jihu nodded.", "\"I\u2019ve heard from Chohong that you\u2019ve been to the Forest of Denial alone.\u201d", "\"Yes.\"", "\"By any chance, have you fought with a herd of Tarneras on your way back?\u201d", "\"Tarneras? I\u2019m not sure.\"", "Seol Jihu rubbed his necklace.", "There was no response. As Flone had recently taken a liking to explore the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain, she was rarely in the pendant.", "\u201cBut I did fight with a group of man-eating monsters\u2026\u2019", "\"Can I know how many times you\u2019ve fought them?\u201d", "\"Two times. They came back to ambush me around dawn after I drove them away once.\u201d", "The man let out a small gasp.", "\u201cThe Tarneras are known to eat people. And the number of battle traces I\u2019ve confirmed were two.\u201d", "\"Then I guess it was me. But why\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cDid you know that there was a nest of Tarneras nearby?\u201d", "\"No.\"", "\u201cThen you must be unaware of the fact that you\u2019ve freed people that were held captive by them.\u201d", "Seol Jihu who had been tilting his head in confusion, widened his eyes.

My name is Marcel Ghionea.\"", "He planted both fists on the ground before raising his head.", "\"I greet my benefactor.\"", "At that moment.", "[You dealing with the man-eating monsters..]", "[You did well.

It was like a mother protecting her child from danger.", "A dead, lightless star was causing this much commotion?", "Stars of Fate on the trajectory of self-destruction were suddenly becoming chaotic?", "That was impossible.", "But that impossible thing was happening.", "Right in front of the Parasite Queen\u2019s gaze.", "[Tsssss\u2026]", "When the Parasite Queen, who had been staring for a long time, finally set her \u2018resolve\u2019\u2026.", "Boom!", "Slamming her hands down, she stood up from her throne.
