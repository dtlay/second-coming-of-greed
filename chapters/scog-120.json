But unlike Archers, Warriors and Priests could not see the situation clearly. The scene only appeared as a speck of light.", "\u201cFour people\u2026 Hm? They\u2019re fighting a monster?\u201d", "New information continued to pour in. What was going on? Was this Stage 2?", "While Seol Jihu was postulating several hypotheses, he caught sight of Straight Face, who was looking down silently.", "\u201cThere are stairs here as well.\u201d", "Just as she said, the platform they were riding on also had stairs going up the mountain.", "\u2018It\u2019s long.\u2019", "Seeing the stairs stretch all the way to the foot of the mountain, Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped.", "\u2018Pillars?\u2019", "One thing that caught his attention was the pillars. There were flat platforms periodically throughout the staircase, and each platform had a single pillar standing on it.", "\u201cYou,\u201d Straight Face turned back. \u201cYou said four people were climbing up the stairs, right?\u201d", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cWhere? Describe it relative to the mountain.\u201d", "\u201cAbout the middle.\u201d", "\u201cDo you see anyone else?\u201d", "\u201cHold on.\u201d Snake Eyes looked around. Then, she fixedly stared in the direction Lara was looking at, and frowned.", "\u201c\u2026You saw it?\u201d", "\u201cI, I did.\u201d", "\u201cIt appeared suddenly, right?\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes.\u201d Lara nodded her head crazily.", "\u201cIt appeared suddenly? What\u2019s \u2018It\u2019?\u201d", "When Straight Face asked, Snake Eyes muttered back, \u201cThere\u2019s only two over there\u2026 Fuck, what\u2019s going on?\u201d", "\u201cJust describe exactly what you\u2019re seeing.\u201d", "Snake Eyes grit her teeth in bewilderment. \u201cOver there. They only have two people. They\u2019re near the foot of the mountain, but while they were climbing up, a monster suddenly popped out of nowhere. I\u2019m not kidding. It really appeared out of thin air.\u201d", "\u201cHow did the two react?\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re fighting.\u201d Lara replied while still watching the far off mountain in a daze. Straight Face dropped her head in response. Seol Jihu also fell into deep thought.", "First, it was probably correct to assume that both the group of four and the group of two were participants of the Banquet.", "\u201c\u2026Maybe,\u201d Straight Face spoke up. \u201cThis mountain is Stage 1.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean? Didn\u2019t Stage 1 end?\u201d", "\u201cThe labyrinth might have been a sample, while this is the real thing.\u201d", "\u201cWait, wait!\u201d Snake Eyes pressed her temple as though her head was hurting. \u201cI\u2019m not following what you\u2019re saying.\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t understand even after looking at them yourself?\u201d", "\u201cShut up. So\u2026 you\u2019re saying that those idiots left the labyrinth before us and are continuing Stage 1?\u201d", "\u201cExactly. It looks like they have to climb the stairs to the top. While killing the monsters that pop out, of course.\u201d", "Straight Face\u2019s analysis caused Snake Eyes to frown. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re right. Then why are we riding this?\u201d", "Just as Snake Eyes said, they were comfortably climbing the mountain with a moving platform, while participants in other mountains were climbing the stairs and fighting for their lives.", "Straight Face revealed her teeth with a grin. \u201cWho knows? If my conjecture is correct, we shouldn\u2019t go all the way up to the peak of the mountain either.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cWe are passing through the sixth pillar right now. We should be stopping at the seventh pillar.\u201d Straight Face leisurely looked around at the other party members and then pointed her finger at the pillar they just passed.", "Seol Jihu nodded his head in agreement. Having heard her conjecture, he guessed how the Golden Commandment came back.", "\u2018It\u2019s not special treatment.\u2019", "Most likely, every group had left the labyrinth through the moving platform at the center. Because, that was the correct way of leaving the building. But not every group would have stopped at the same spot. The more people a group had when leaving the labyrinth, the closer to the top the platform would travel.", "The pillars were there to serve as checkpoints.", "What would have happened if Seol Jihu left with just Maria?", "\u2018We would have been dropped off at the second pillar\u2026.\u2019", "And forced to climb the stairs just as painfully as the others.", "Seol Jihu glanced at the white-headband girl. She was making a suggestive smile.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shame but\u2026 it shouldn\u2019t take long to reach the peak from the seventh pillar.\u201d", "Straight Face stretched her neck side-to-side and prepared to hop off the platform. However, her estimate was not entirely correct. Contrary to their expectations, the platform they were riding on passed through the seventh pillar as well.", "When Seol Jihu stared at her for an explanation, she scowled and burst out, \u201cWhat? What are you looking at?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not our fault that that person died.\u201d A hollow voice rang out. When the quiet girl opened her mouth, the nearby gazes naturally fell on her. \u201cHe was nearly dead when he entered. We couldn\u2019t heal him either\u2026 so it seems the Banquet didn\u2019t count him in.\u201d", "The girl\u2019s suggestion made Lara exclaim in disbelief, \u201cNo way, that means this place knows all about our situation!\u201d", "The feeble girl shrugged as if to say that was outside of her understanding. Snake Eyes muttered in response, \u201cYou can talk? I for sure thought you were mute.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d", "\u201cDas roode~.\u201d Snake Eyes imitated the girl in a mocking tone.", "\u201cWell, we\u2019ll find out.\u201d Then, she lied down on the platform like she had given up worrying about the matter. But she had to get up soon enough, as they were closing in on the mountaintop. As expected, the eighth pillar was standing at the end of the staircase, or, in other words, the mountaintop.", "Soon, the platform stopped and descended until it touched the mountain.", "\u201cAre we first?\u201d Snake Eyes stepped on the ground joyously. How could she be anything but happy, when she almost ended up climbing the mountain from the beginning?", "But just like the saying, \u2018even a jade has dirty spots\u2019, there was a team that arrived at the mountaintop first. That group consisted of eight people. Clearly, everyone had survived.", "\u201cDamn, we\u2019re second.\u201d Snake Eyes grumbled as if someone spoiled her fun, but in truth, the order of arrival didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was that they got here. The team that arrived first also noticed them and slowly shortened the distance.", "Seol Jihu studied the group to see if there was anyone he knew. At that moment, he noticed someone walking toward him from the other group.", "\u201cEh? Is that who I think it is?\u201d Maria noticed too. It was the High-Rank Priest that Kazuki invited.", "\u201cWho the hell is that dressed in nothing but black?\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly at Snake Eyes\u2019 mumbling. Just like before, the Priest was hard to miss with her head covered by a hood and her body covered by a gown.", "\u201cWow, wow! I\u2019m jealous. One man and six women. You must have been one happy camper.\u201d The man standing at the forefront of the group commented sarcastically.", "\u2018Happy? Happy my ass.\u2019 Seol Jihu cursed inwardly, especially when he remembered how much energy was sucked out of him in the labyrinth.", "\u201cBut it\u2019s interesting. You only have seven people, yet you flew all the way to the top\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAh, about that\u2026.\u201d", "While the man and Lara exchanged information, Seol Jihu greeted the Priest with courtesy, \u201cHello.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "But the Priest didn\u2019t say a word no matter how many times he tried to talk to her.", "\u2018I don\u2019t think she\u2019s trying to ignore me, though.\u2019", "From the way the Priest glanced at him from top to bottom, Seol Jihu guessed she was checking to see whether he was injured.", "Tap, Tap. She even straightened the wrinkles on his clothes.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026.\u201d Seeing the Priest act like a mother duck that just found her lost duckling, Seol Jihu felt himself feeling a little strange.", "\u2018Now is not the time to be doing this.\u2019", "The Banquet wasn\u2019t over just because they reached the top. He couldn\u2019t just sit around and wait leisurely when Chohong and Hugo could be fighting for their lives.", "\u2018If I can just find out which direction they\u2019re coming up in\u2026\u2019", "\u201cYou can\u2019t help them.\u201d At that moment, just as Seol Jihu was about to move, Lara\u2019s voice struck his ears.", "\u201cYes, the moment you step on the mountaintop, you are no longer allowed to interfere with anything happening on the stairs.\u201d The man explained slowly.", "\u201cWe tried various methods. We couldn\u2019t go down, support others with long-ranged attacks, or even communicate with them in any way. According to her, the world between the mountaintop and the stairway has been separated.\u201d The man spoke as he looked at the Priest spinning around Seol Jihu.", "\u2018She talked?\u2019", "When Seol Jihu turned and looked at the Priest, she stopped and stared out to the far distance.", "\u201cThen\u2026 we\u2019re stuck here?\u201d", "\u201cPretty much. We have no choice but to wait, for now.\u201d With the man\u2019s explanation finished, Seol Jihu glanced at the Priest for confirmation. The Priest turned her head and nodded slowly. In the end, Seol Jihu had no choice but to put down his spear.", "Stage 1 had ended. Seol Jihu\u2019s party naturally split up. Although he knew there was no reason for them to cooperate anymore, he was still left with a bitter taste in his mouth. Lara and Sophie expressed their gratitude, Snake Eyes left to take a look around the mountaintop, and the white-headband girl disappeared without a word.", "Maria sat down under a tree, saying she wanted to rest. As for Straight Face\u2026", "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d", "\u2026She struck up a conversation before leaving.", "\u201cSeol.\u201d", "\u201cSeol, Seol\u2026 Seol?\u201d After repeating the name a couple of times, Straight Face\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cFrom Haramark?\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Ah, yes.\u201d", "It could have been a misunderstanding, but, for the first time, she genuinely seemed surprised.", "\u201cAh\u2026 so you\u2019re that\u2026.\u201d After nodding her head a couple of times, she smiled and put a cigarette in her mouth.", "\u201cIs the Old Man doing well?\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Anyways, you weren\u2019t half-bad.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t like that you dragged those useless bitches with us\u2026 but looking down at the rest of the contenders from here isn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d", "Straight Face\u2019s snickering sent cold sweat down his back. Perhaps, this woman was a natural sadist. She was only missing a black leather suit and a whip.", "\u2018But her skills are top-notch.\u2019", "Her quickdraw, which was invisible to the naked eye, was still etched in his mind. She certainly had skills befitting a High Ranker. Moreover, she was from the same Area and was colorless, unlike Snake Eyes. Getting to know her didn\u2019t seem like such a terrible idea.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d", "\u201cHmm, don\u2019t you know it\u2019s rude to ask a lady her name so casually?\u201d Straight Face showed her unique arrogant face. When Seol Jihu reacted with a shocked face, she shook her hands saying it was a joke.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Rahee.\u201d", "\u201cHee? That\u2019s a pretty name.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t add the follow-up, \u2018unlike how you act\u2019 comment.", "Straight Face shook her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s Ra. Hee.\u201d (Rahee)", "\u201c\u2026What about your last name?\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t say yours either.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re calculative in weird places.\u201d", "\u201cOh, you\u2019re already complaining?\u201d", "Straight Face dropped the cigarette, pushed her bangs up, and spat on the ground graciously.", "\u201cGetting my phone number is going to be harder.\u201d", "With that, she turned around and left with a final comment, \u201cGood luck finding out.\u201d", "\u2018But I already know.\u2019", "As he watched the woman, \u2018Oh\u2019 Rahee, walk away, Seol Jihu stuck out his tongue.", "*", "There was nothing on the mountaintop. As Seol Jihu wandered until the end of Stage 1, praying for his teammates\u2019 safe return, more and more teams began to reach the mountaintop. After watching quietly for a while, Seol Jihu noticed that no teams arrived with all eight members except the first. He saw one team reach the top with seven members, but most teams had only three to five members.", "Thankfully, Chohong and Hugo performed as expected. Chohong was the first to reach the top, and her team consisted of five members. Apparently, their team had six members when they left the labyrinth, but one had died during the climb.", "\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Seol Jihu asked as he watched the exhausted Chohong.", "\u201cI thought I\u2019d die. Really.\u201d Chohong heaved out heavy breaths and plopped down on the ground. She didn\u2019t have any serious injuries, but her mace was stained with blood and her hair was dyed silver. Since she was forced to use Manifestation, Seol Jihu could guess how difficult her journey must have been.", "\u201cBut you look fine. Why are you brimming with energy?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I had good luck with the team,\u201d Seol Jihu lied.", "\u201cFuck, I\u2019m jealous. I met complete shitstains\u2026.\u201d Chohong growled and glared to the side, and her teammates instantly flinched.", "\u201cIdiots who are all talk with no skills\u2026 You don\u2019t know how many times I held myself back from killing them.\u201d Chohong\u2019s chilling tone showed how much stress she had to endure. On the other hand, Seol Jihu guessed that every team had similar problems as one man from Chohong\u2019s team was glaring at her with resentment, even though he couldn\u2019t say a word in front of her.", "Hugo wasn\u2019t looking any better either. He arrived with two others. Apparently, he left the labyrinth with four others, with two dying in the process.", "Listening to Chohong and Hugo\u2019s stories, Seol Jihu felt like he was listening to a fairytale. It was only now that he understood how great of a reward it was to pass the stairs automatically. Although he wanted to listen to Hugo\u2019s story in more detail, Hugo had incurred heavy injuries, so they had to go look for Maria immediately. Thankfully, they found a Priest nearby healing injured Earthlings.", "With that, members of the Carpe Diem had all passed the first stage. But not all of their companions were present. Seeing people climbing the stairs intermittently, Seol Jihu finally sat his butt on the ground.", "Several hours had passed since Seol Jihu first reached the mountaintop, but Stage 1 was showing no signs of an end. Just when Seol Jihu thought it was over, two or three people would show up at the mountaintop.", "The only difference was that none of the latecomers had more than three members. Since Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t just wait day and night, he took the time for a brief self-reflection.", "\u201850 points.\u2019", "That was the score he gave himself for Stage 1. He couldn\u2019t be more generous than that. The result was good; there was no doubt about it. But the process was worth zero points.", "Not once had the seven of them worked together. Of course, one could argue that taking turns to open the door was more efficient, but that was just pure coincidence. Seol Jihu could only patch the twisted relationships, not mend them.", "To be honest, Seol Jihu thought he was more of a mediator than a leader. He appeased his teammates with words and kept them together, but could he honestly say he \u2018led\u2019 them?", "\u201cHere you are.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was smoking to alleviate the stifling feeling in his heart when a shadow approached him with a familiar voice.", "\u201cMister Kazuki?\u201d", "\u201cMn.\u201d", "\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d", "\u201cAn hour ago. Can you give me one too?\u201d", "Kazuki sat down next to him. Seol Jihu was surprised Kazuki was here as he handed him a cigarette.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d", "\u201cI was busy trying to find out something.\u201d Kazuki pointed at the cigarette in his mouth. When Seol Jihu lit it for him, Kazuki took a deep breath and exhaled just as deeply.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a smoker.\u201d", "\u201cOnly when shitty things happen.\u201d", "It was the first time Seol Jihu saw Kazuki use coarse language. Examining him more closely, he could see that Kazuki looked exhausted.", "\u201cIt must have been hard.\u201d", "\u201cIt felt like the limits of my patience were being tested.\u201d With that, Kazuki smoked the cigarette silently. He seemed to be venting his anger, so Seol Jihu sensibly didn\u2019t dig into it.", "\u201cSeol,\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the cigarette burned to the filter that Kazuki opened his mouth again. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to say.\u201d", "He sounded quite serious."]}
