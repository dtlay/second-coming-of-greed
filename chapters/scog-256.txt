{"cid": "256", "title": "Chapter 256. Fox, O Fox (2)", "content": ["Recently, the Carpe Diem building had been seeing a constant stream of visitors. The reason was simple. With free money and food being handed out, how could Paradisians not make their daily trips here?", "\u201cLine up! Line up! We have enough food for everyone, so don\u2019t worry!\u201d", "A young lady wearing a spotless Priest\u2019s robe shouted at the crowd gathered in front of the building.", "Kim Hannah requested Seo Yuhui to take on this job, and she was displaying skills that went above and beyond Kim Hannah\u2019s expectations.", "As expected of someone who was experienced in volunteer work, she acquired food supply in bulk at a cheap price and visited Eva\u2019s temple to supplement their lack of personnel.", "Thanks to her, the area in front of the building was only loud, but well-organized.", "\u201cAs expected of Haramark\u2019s war hero! He\u2019s really different than the rest!\u201d", "One man smiled as he held up a box of food supplies.", "\u201cThey say he killed that frightening First Army Commander! You can\u2019t compare him to those ordinary Earthlings!\u201d", "A woman who brought her kids along jumped into the conversation with a smile.", "Seol Jihu and Carpe Diem\u2019s value was exponentially increasing with this act of charity. Not only did they give out food and living expenses, but they also paid for people\u2019s debts as well.", "Although the debt wasn\u2019t completely gone, Carpe Diem\u2019s generous 10-year loan replacement with an interest rate of 9.63% was definitely worth the praise.", "\u201cWell, Viva La Carpe Diem! I wish their leader would become the king.\u201d", "\u201cHey, what if people hear you?\u201d", "\u201cSo what!? He\u2019s a million times better than the queen who doesn\u2019t show up even at times like this!\u201d", "\u201cI guess even if he\u2019s an Earthling\u2026\u201d", "The woman and man each with a box in their arms walked away as they continued their conversation.", "Seol Jihu was watching all of this from a distance with a satisfied face. He just felt good. His bothered state after seeing Eva\u2019s nightlife and the VIP auction house had relaxed a bit now.", "Although the expenses of having hundreds of visitors every day were not insignificant, it was not a big concern as they had far more money than what was being spent.", "Kim Hannah said that the deposit paid last time was more than enough, but even if they ran out, they could just use the money in the storage.", "Weirdly enough, none of this felt like a waste.", "Whether it was because they were now rich or because of the remaining Rothschear inheritances, Seol Jihu felt like he had plenty. Back when he was addicted to gambling, even losing a penny felt like a waste.", "He thought to himself and grinned. Then, he saw a familiar face and moved towards the person.", "\u201cYou were watching too?\u201d", "He stood next to her and asked, but no reply came back. Kim Hannah simply stood there, speechlessly watching the scene of charity. Seol Jihu shrugged his shoulders and asked.", "\u201cBy the way, we still haven\u2019t registered as an organization, have we?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I was going to mention that soon.\u201d", "Kim Hannah finally started conversing.", "\u201cI think it would be better if we didn\u2019t register for a while, what do you think?\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked his eyes in surprise.", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cWe can get on their nerves even more, that way.\u201d", "Kim Hannah continued without shifting her line of sight.", "\u201cAs long as an organization isn\u2019t officially listed, it won\u2019t be recognized as one. Meaning, Carpe Diem is still a team.\u201d", "\u201cOkay.\u201d", "\u201cThink about it, an official organization, not just one or two, but a grand alliance of seven is helplessly wrecked by a small team of ten. How ridiculous would it look? They must be fuming.\u201d", "While seeming convinced, Seol Jihu carefully mulled over Kim Hannah\u2019s words.", "If it was in the past, he would have simply agreed, saying, \u2018I see.\u2019 But having observed the situation for the past few days, he had something on his mind, though it was merely a conjecture\u2026", "\u201cI was reading the Eva code of law for the past few days.\u201d", "Kim Hannah gave a sideways look, hearing the law being mentioned again.", "\u201cThere were quite a few laws regarding Earthlings. One of them bans violence or use of force in the city.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a law in name only.\u201d", "Kim Hannah scoffed.", "\u201cFights break out several times a day, from both Paradisians and Earthlings side.\u201d", "\u201cRight, but I\u2019m not talking about simple fistfights that result from insignificant conflicts.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d", "\u201cThe important thing is that this law has an exception clause, the same one that restricts the use of excessive force in the Federation border region.\u201d", "Kim Hannah lifted her chin slightly before slowly turning her face to look at him with a renewed expression.", "\u201c\u2026I get what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d", "Then, she let out a laugh of ridicule.", "\u201cBut even if we do this, they still won\u2019t do anything for a while.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to do anything again?\u201d", "\u201cProbably.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d", "\u201cBecause of you.\u201d", "Kim Hannah pointed at Seol Jihu with her finger.", "\u201cAnd me.\u201d", "Then, she pointed at herself.", "\u201cWhy me? I\u2019m only a High Ranker.\u201d", "\u201cNot just a High Ranker.\u201d", "Kim Hannah crossed her arms as she spoke.", "\u201cThere aren\u2019t even ten Unique Rankers in Paradise. If you exclude the Executors or the so-called apostles of gods, the number is even less. But even these Executors only have a chance to win when they fight against the Parasites\u2019 Army Commanders. Their victory isn\u2019t even guaranteed.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cBut wait, there\u2019s a High Ranker in front of me who\u2019s killed a Parasite Army Commander, something that not even Executors could do before!\u201d", "Having experienced the war before, Seol Jihu had to accept that Kim Hannah\u2019s words were true.", "\u201cThey must be thinking, \u2018Huh? What\u2019s up with these guys? Why are they acting up so much? Are they insane? No, wait, they\u2019re asking for a fight, plain and simple. But that\u2019s impossible unless that Fox has actually gone crazy. Wait\u2014\u2019\u201d", "Stopping there, Kim Hannah gestured at Seol Jihu with her chin.", "\u201c\u2026They\u2019re laying low because they\u2019re afraid of me?\u201d", "\u201cYou said you relied on several Awakening Skills to kill Undying Diligence, but you never made an official clarification. Most people don\u2019t know the truth. That\u2019s why the organizations are gritting their teeth and still biding their time. Because with one wrong move, they would have to face the spear of the mysterious Earthling who killed the Parasite\u2019s First Army Commander.\u201d", "This all made sense, but Seol Jihu was left with more questions. It was then.", "\u201cJihu.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s voice suddenly got lower. She turned and stared outside the window again.", "\u201cDo you know what the most important thing is when a scammer is preparing to strike?\u201d", "Seol Jihu raised one of his eyebrows. Kim Hannah continued without batting an eye.", "\u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2014 to make sure the person getting scammed doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s getting scammed.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOnly when the scam is successful would they realize, \u2018Ah, that was a scam.\u2019 By then, it would be too late to do anything about it.", "Seol Jihu understood what she was trying to say.", "\u201cI get it. The scammers at gambling houses don\u2019t win a large amount of money immediately. They wait, losing a good chunk of their own money, before reversing everything.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cI heard they slowly bide their time, waiting for the opportunity to strike back big. Apparently, it\u2019s important to make the victim follow on his own initiative.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes widened, seemingly in great surprise. But soon, she regained her composure and smiled faintly. The way she tilted her head down with her mouth closed tight, she looked like she was trying hard to hold back her laughter.", "\u201cWhat? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d", "\u201cNo\u2014\u201d", "When Seol Jihu asked nonchalantly, Kim Hannah giggled and covered her mouth.", "\u201cI was just surprised. That was the perfect comparison.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s why you laughed though.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. I just found it funny hearing a former gambling addict say it.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smirked before turning back.", "\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked sullenly.", "\u201cI have someone to meet~\u201d", "Kim Hannah waved her hand as she happily walked away. Seeing her slowly grow farther away, Seol Jihu mumbled inwardly, \u2018I wish she\u2019d just tell me outright.\u2019", "She wasn\u2019t hiding everything, but the way she skillfully dodged the main point, Seol Jihu really felt like he was bewitched by a fox.", "\u2018Just what is she thinking?\u2019", "Seol Jihu sighed, shaking his head side to side.", "*", "Ochoa Cartel\u2019s leader, Omar Garcia, was in a foul mood. Not only did he lose one of his main businesses, but when he tried to make up for his losses by taking over Royal Pattaya\u2019s adult entertainment business, Carpe Diem had flipped the table on him as if they had been waiting.", "His savings were disappearing by the second.", "\u2018These fuckers\u2026\u2019", "Although he was acting calm on the outside, he was on the verge of exploding on the inside.", "\u2018Damn it, and I was trying to be nice too\u2026 You really want to do this?\u2019", "It was obvious that Kim Hannah was behind all this. That was the problem.", "Omar Garcia was a true Paradise veteran. Naturally, he had heard of Miss Foxy\u2019s notoriety.", "He couldn\u2019t call himself a righteous person by any means, but Omar Garcia truly thought his evildoings were a drop in the bucket compared to Kim Hannah.", "According to the rumors, even Haramark\u2019s famous internal strife was her handy work.", "A ruthless demoness who did not hesitate to employ the most devious means for benefits. That was who Kim Hannah was as an Earthling.", "And that was why Omar Garcia was so doubtful. Unless that Fox had gone mad, there was no way she would do something like this without a plan.", "Judging by her recent actions, she was clearly looking to fight the organizations. No matter how hard he thought, he couldn\u2019t figure out what gave her the confidence to be so bold.", "\u2018Is it Sinyoung? No, they kicked her out, like euthanizing a hunting dog that bit its own master\u2019s hand. Then why did she come to Eva\u2026?\u2019", "The relationship between Paradise\u2019s organizations was quite complex.", "Sicilia called themselves the conqueror of the south, but put in a different way, one could say they were forced out to Haramark. Because the agreement they made at the end of Haramark\u2019s conflict prevented them from influencing other cities, Omar Garcia did not have to worry about Carpe Diem having Sicilia to protect them.", "If they went against this agreement, Paradise\u2019s number one organization, situated in its capital, would definitely not ignore the matter, stepping in to help.", "Thus, Omar Garcia could rule out this possibility with near 100 percent certainty. But it was also hard to believe that Haramark Royal Family was behind this.", "As he was brooding over the problem for a long time, a crystal next to him suddenly shone.", "Omar Garcia looked up. It was the call he had been waiting for.", "\u201cYes, it\u2019s me. Yes, yes, how\u2026\u201d", "He immediately placed his hand on the crystal and strained his ears.", "\u201c\u2026Come again?\u201d", "After listening for a while, he furrowed his brows. But even that only lasted a moment as he dropped his jaw, replying.", "\u201cAh, yes\u2026 Is that true?\u201d", "The corner of his mouth curled up.", "\u201cYes, yes, of course. We\u2019ll stay put, so no worries. We won\u2019t lay our hands on the Federation\u2019s members, especially at a time like this.\u201d", "\u2014Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.", "\u201cOf course, of course, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.\u201d", "\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thanking me for, but anyway, reflect on this carefully.", "With that, the call ended. Seeing the light on the communication crystal flicker off, Omar Garcia burst into laughter.", "\u201cHah, this manipulative woman. She\u2019s really the scariest one.\u201d", "Mumbling to himself, he clasped his hands together and rubbed his thumbs.", "\u201cI see, so that\u2019s how it is\u2026 In that case\u2026\u201d", "After taking a moment to organize his thoughts, he called someone. A man and a woman soon walked in.", "\u201cDid you call us, sir?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m here~\u201d", "The man with well-defined facial features wore a heavy fullmetal armor, while the ivory-haired woman wore a light chainmail armor.", "Oliver Rogers and Noah Freya. They were both High Ranker Warriors and aces of the Ochoa Cartel. At the very least, they could both defeat Jirayu Matthew with ease.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really been a while since you called both of us together.\u201d", "The woman flaunting a seductive peach blossom skin asked with an enchanting smile. Omar Garcia explained immediately.", "\u201cI have a question I want to ask both of you.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s about Carpe Diem.\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 I expected as much.\u201d", "Noah Freya placed her hand on the slender waist above her perky butt, tilting her head curiously.", "\u201cBut if it\u2019s about Carpe Diem\u2026\u201d", "\u201cHave you heard of the Earthling, Phi Sora?\u201d", "\u201cAh, of course, we would be fools if we haven\u2019t.\u201d", "Noah Freya replied right away. Omar Garcia turned to the man maintaining his silence.", "\u201cWhat about you?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve heard a little.\u201d", "It was a vague answer, but regardless, it seemed they both knew her.", "\u201cDo you know how strong she is? For example, if you fight her one-on-one\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll lose.\u201d", "\u201cNot a chance.\u201d", "Oliver Rogers and Noah Freya answered instantly.", "\u201cJust so you know, even if Rogers and I fight together, we won\u2019t last more than a few moves before we get beheaded.\u201d", "With Noah Freya delivering a sure-kill blow, Omar Garcia became dazed.", "\u201cShe\u2019s that strong?\u201d", "\u201cJust because you\u2019re a High Ranker, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the same Level 5. How should I say this\u2026 mm, she\u2019s on a different league than us.\u201d", "\u201cI always considered you two to be first-rate among High Rankers.\u201d", "Oliver Rogers revealed a hint of dissatisfaction, but Noah Freya shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly.", "\u201cIf we\u2019re first-rate, then that Phi Sora woman is transcendental. She\u2019d have to thank Thousand Sword for advancing to Level 6\u2026 but she\u2019s a master of the quickdraw and among the Level 5s, she\u2019s definitely in the top 10. You can tell just by how easily she beats up that Oh Rahee.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Then what about Chung Chohong?\u201d", "\u201cHmm, I\u2019d have to fight her to know for sure, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m all that confident\u2026\u201d", "Omar Garcia\u2019s jaw dropped. He had expected as much, but Carpe Diem\u2019s High Rankers seemed to be true monsters.", "\u201cDid you call us just to ask that?\u201d", "Oliver Rogers asked curtly. Omar Garcia shook his head with a displeased face.", "\u201c\u2026I also wanted to ask about Seol Jihu. To assess our strength.\u201d", "\u201cSeol Jihu\u2026 You must mean Carpe Diem\u2019s leader.\u201d", "Noah Freya rubbed her chin.", "\u201cI have no clue. Everything about that person is shrouded in a veil of mystery\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI think the rumors about him are grossly exaggerated, no?\u201d", "\u201cNot exactly.\u201d", "Oliver Rogers chimed in.", "\u201cAlthough there are some ridiculous tales going around, it is true that Seol Jihu killed Undying Diligence. There are countless witnesses who can attest to this.\u201d", "Omar Garcia frowned.", "\u201cBut how is that possible!? If the First Army Commander invades Eva, the city will be destroyed that very day!\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t disagree. After all, Eva doesn\u2019t have an Executor. Ah, I guess the Daughter of Luxuria is here now.\u201d", "\u201cI know. But what I really want to know is whether Seol Jihu is above Undying Diligence.\u201d", "\u201cAh, then that\u2019s a definite no.\u201d", "Oliver Rogers\u2019 assurance made Omar Garcia\u2019s eyes flicker with light.", "\u201cI was interested in that war, so I did my own research. Seol Jihu apparently dominated that battlefield like a demon, but they say he received many Executors\u2019 help.\u201d", "\u201cOh yeah?\u201d", "\u201cPride, Sloth, Lust, Wrath, Avarice\u2026 There were five Executors there. And though she isn\u2019t an Executor, the Sacred Empress participated as well.\u201d", "\u201cSo there were six Executor-level Earthlings.\u201d", "\u201cYes. And reports say that the Daughter of Luxuria and the Sacred Empress helped Seol Jihu wholeheartedly. That was why he could kill Undying Diligence. Some of the rumors that say he single-handedly overwhelmed three Army Commanders is false.\u201d", "\u201cRight, that makes sense.\u201d", "\u201cHe was also in a coma for several weeks following the war, and considering that the Federation came to heal him, it\u2019s highly likely that he used abilities that took a heavy toll on his body.\u201d", "\u201cGreat!\u201d", "Omar Garcia hit the table like he finally heard what he wanted to hear.", "\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that, right?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cWhat I mean is, the reason Carpe Diem is acting out so much is because they\u2019re confident in their team\u2019s and Seol Jihu\u2019s strength.\u201d", "\u201cMost likely. They\u2019ve been playing with the Parasites. How can we enter their eyes?\u201d", "Oliver Rogers replied calmly before putting on a doubtful expression.", "\u201cIf you still have doubts, sir, you can always look into this yourself\u2026 But why are you asking us this?\u201d", "Omar Garcia smiled.", "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a very important matter.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cIn the worst-case scenario, we may have to face Carpe Diem\u2019s main force.

Against an overwhelming number, they can only lose.\u201d", "Noah Freya nodded too in agreement.", "\u201cNow if we can mobilize the kingdom\u2019s army on top of that, they really won\u2019t have a choice, right?\u201d", "\u201cObviously. But can you mobilize them?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll pull some strings and make sure I can. But before that\u2014\u201d", "Omar Garcia got up from his seat.", "\u201cI\u2019ll have to give the Triads a visit.\u201d", "\u201cThe Triads?\u201d", "\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing much. You know, to confirm what you just said\u2026\u201d", "He trailed off as the corner of his mouth curled up.", "\u201cAnd to ask what their intentions are.\u201d", "*", "Same time.", "A party was underway in a room tucked away inside Carpe Diem\u2019s building."]}
