The Savior of Eva (4)", "content": ["He saw a familiar scene\u2014 Roselle\u2019s dream world.", "As this was his third time coming to this place, he was no longer surprised. Only, he wondered why she summoned him.", "Roselle was sitting at a table in the garden, drinking tea. On her opposite side was a half-eaten cake and a teacup. It clearly showed that someone else was there just a moment ago, and Seol Jihu had a good idea who that was.", "\u201cI finally got her to go back just now.\u201d", "Roselle took a sip of tea before speaking calmly. For some reason, her voice seemed to be trembling very faintly.", "\u201cHow was it?\u201d", "\u201cHow was it, you ask?\u201d", "Tang. She placed the teacup down on the plate, hard.", "\u201cI had to listen to her story for twelve hours. We didn\u2019t talk, I just listened.\u201d", "Roselle took a deep breath, making her tiny chest puff out a little. Then, she said in an exhausted tone.", "\u201cHow should I say this\u2026 I must have underestimated that child a bit.\u201d", "She continued with a haggard look.", "\u201cI guess you could say she has a frustrating personality. Ah, fuck, just thinking about it is pissing me off.\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "Seol Jihu doubted his ears.", "\u201cDid you just curse?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d", "Roselle replied with a straight face.", "\u201cNo, you definitely did. Was it that bad?\u201d", "\u201cAh, a flower petal fluttering by must have said that. How frustrated must it have been to blurt out like that?\u201d", "\u201cHow can a petal talk?\u201d", "\u201cAnything can talk in this dream world. Right, petal?\u201d", "[Yes, Lady Roselle.]", "One of the flower petals fluttering in the air really talked. Seol Jihu jumped in surprise.", "[But I had nothing to do with it, lady. I, Little Petal, did not cuurrrrssse!?]", "The petal suddenly screamed in the middle of talking and flew far away.", "[Aaak. Aaaaaak. It\u2019s too strong!]", "Seol Jihu stared at the petal being torn apart by the wind, then snapped out of his daze at the sound of Roselle clearing her throat.", "\u201cKuhum, anyway, it wasn\u2019t too bad.\u201d", "He felt like Roselle was trying to change the subject and gladly went along with it.", "\u201cIf I lived in the same era as that child, I would never have taken the time to acquaint myself with her. That said, her talent was just as I expected. And judging by the way she went off with that big mouth of hers, she seems to be good at focusing as well.\u201d", "\u2018Now she\u2019s just insulting her outright\u2026\u2019 Seol Jihu smiled faintly.", "\u201cSo the talk went well?\u201d", "\u201cWould I be saying this if it didn\u2019t?\u201d", "She sounded strangely hostile. Roselle pressed her forehead, then shook her head.", "\u201cMy apologies. I should not be getting angry at Seol Jihu-nim like this. It\u2019s just that thinking about her keeps pissing me off\u2026\u201d", "On the other hand, Seol Jihu was amazed at Charlotte Aria. Since Roselle spent hundreds of years by herself, she should have been hungry for human interaction as well. So to make her lose her self-control and react inthis way, he couldn\u2019t help but praise Charlotte Aria\u2019s \u2018strength\u2019.", "\u2018Well, Lady Roselle can read other people\u2019s thoughts, so that must have multiplied the pain.\u2019", "\u201cAnyway, what I can tell you is that rigorous management is needed for that child to grow.\u201d", "\u201cManagement?\u201d", "\u201cI am not saying that she is a bad seed. There are people who cannot become anything even if they receive the utmost care and attention from the world\u2019s best manager. However, this child\u2019s talent is guaranteed.\u201d", "\u201cI agree fully.\u201d", "Seol Jihu easily agreed.", "\u201cThank you for your understanding.\u201d", "It was then that Roselle showed a feeble smile.", "\u201cAnd for that reason, I would like to shamelessly ask for your cooperation.\u201d", "\u201cCooperation?\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t until the next day that Seol Jihu understood what her words meant.", "*", "\u201cSeol Jihuuuuuu!\u201d", "The lobby resounded sonorously first thing in the morning.", "Seol Jihu looked down from the 6th floor with an ominous foreboding, and lo and behold, he saw a girl dashing across the lobby.", "He had gotten a message from Sorg K\u00fchne saying, \u2018The queen has left. I am sorry.\u2019 At first, he failed to realize why he was apologizing, but now he knew.", "He didn\u2019t think things would turn out like this.", "\u201cWhat the? Who\u2019s that brat?\u201d", "Chohong, who had just finished breakfast and was walking down from the cafeteria, asked as she looked down from the guardrail. Seol Jihu answered calmly.", "\u201cEva\u2019s queen.\u201d", "\u201cHaha, funny. Who is it?\u201d", "Chohong didn\u2019t believe him easily. It took Seol Jihu a while to convince her that he was telling the truth.", "\u201cWow, she\u2019s really the queen?\u201d", "Chohong couldn\u2019t hide her surprise as she stared at Charlotte Aria, who was asking, \u201cWhere is he? Where is Seol Jihu?\u201d while shaking Kim Hannah, who had gone down to meet her.", "\u201cI thought I was back at Haramark for a second. No, even Teresa and that old king weren\u2019t this bad.\u201d", "She sniffled while shaking her head. Then, she patted Seol Jihu\u2019s back before turning around.", "\u201cWell, good luck, Princess Collector. Wait, should I say Queen Collector? No, it\u2019s both.\u201d", "\u201cThe heck is that\u2026 Where are you going?\u201d", "\u201cBack to my room.\u201d", "\u201cCome with me. The queen is here. You can take this opportunity to introduce yourself.\u201d", "\u201cAn ordinary member like me? Naaaah. The higher-ups can take care of it.\u201d", "Chohong hastened back as she replied like she couldn\u2019t bother with it.", "\u201cPlus, my sense of smell is telling me not to get involved.\u201d", "\u201cYour dog nose?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d", "Chohong disappeared quickly. Seol Jihu sighed and then went to the reception room to wait for the queen.", "While he was counting to 100 in his mind, the door shot open and Charlotte Aria ran in.", "\u201cSeol Jihuuu!\u201d", "\u201cAh, you\u2019re here?\u201d", "Before Seol Jihu could even get up from his seat, Charlotte Aria spread her arms out.", "\u201cYou were right! You were really telling the truth!\u201d", "She grabbed his shirt and jumped excitedly.", "\u201cYou must have met Lady Roselle.\u201d", "\u201cUn, un! I\u2019ve never had such a mysterious experience! My goodness! A dream world where you can achieve anything you imagine!\u201d", "Seol Jihu tried to get the excited Charlotte Aria to calm down and get her to sit, but she did not budge an inch and focused on spitting out words. In the end, Seol Jihu gave up and asked helplessly.", "\u201cD-Did you become her friend?\u201d", "\u201cUn! You were right. She understood me sooo well.\u201d", "\u2018Obviously. Lady Roselle can read her thoughts, so she must have said exactly what the queen wanted to hear.\u2019", "\u201cShe was a really good person!\u201d", "The depressed look she had just a day earlier as she refused to eat and drink was nowhere to be seen. The way her cheeks were flushed in excitement and her eyes were sparkling like stars, it looked like she was dying to speak.", "\u201cAh, yes, is that true?\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cThat the dream world isn\u2019t everlasting.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria told the story: Roselle used the Eternal Light of Wisdom before her death to create a dream world, but mana was not an infinite resource. Once the mana maintaining the dream world ran out, both Roselle and the dream world would perish eternally.", "Although she coincidentally met Seol Jihu and was able to maintain the dream world from disappearing, it was only a temporary solution as the fundamental problem had not been solved. So to resolve this problem, she needed someone to help her research.", "Roselle seemed to have tricked Charlotte Aria as such.", "\u2018What a brilliant idea!\u2019", "Teresa had described Charlotte Aria as an unconditional ally.", "Although she was reckless and without a guiding principle, what if they could apply this personality of hers directly to the study of sorcery?", "Roselle must have lied with this in mind. After all, Charlotte Aria would do her best to stop her friend from perishing.", "\u2018As expected of Lady Roselle.\u2019", "Seol Jihu nodded his head in approval. With just one meeting, Roselle had noticed Charlotte Aria\u2019s idiosyncrasy and even came up with a good method to use it. Such brilliance was truly befitting of a witch who existed for hundreds of years.", "\u201cThat is correct.\u201d", "Seol Jihu played along.", "\u201cAh! I knew it.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria looked regretful.", "\u201cThe problem is that sorcery, the discipline that created the dream world, is a very unique and special discipline.\u201d", "\u201cUn, un, that is what I heard as well.\u201d", "\u201cIn this current time, Magicians have become rare, and not even they can understand Lady Roselle\u2019s profound discipline. You see, to the current school of thought, sorcery is something like heresy.\u201d", "\u201cThe Empire was like that. They rejected the use of mana for anything other than magic. They were especially strict about persecuting witchcraft. I find that very regrettable.\u201d", "Although this did not matter now since the Empire had fallen, Charlotte Aria replied positively to just about everything. She was quite easy to deal with for situations like this.", "\u201cSo Lady Roselle needs a Magician who can understand her school of discipline. Charlotte Aria-nim is like a blank slate right now, which is precisely why you won\u2019t be influenced by the existing discipline. Since you\u2019re talented on top of that, Lady Roselle said you will be able to absorb her teachings like a sponge.\u201d", "Once Seol Jihu started praising her, Charlotte Aria began to laugh gleefully like a little kid. Seol Jihu then continued in a serious tone.", "\u201cPlease, I beg of you. Because I am not a Magician, I am limited in the ways I can help her, but Your Majesty is different. Please help the dream world not disappear.\u201d", "\u201cI shall grant your wish!\u201d", "Charlotte Aria took her hands off Seol Jihu\u2019s shirt.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve laid out the mat, how can I just stand still and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist? Do not worry. I will learn this sorcery thing and prevent Roselle\u2019s annihilation!\u201d", "She clenched her hands and swore resolutely. Judging by the way she was so full of fighting spirit, she seemed to really be invested in it.", "Seol Jihu smiled inwardly in satisfaction.", "\u201cThank you. Both Lady Roselle and I have great expectations of you.\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes. Oh right, come to think of it\u2026\u201d", "Charlotte Aria looked around the room before finally sitting down.", "Seol Jihu blinked rapidly. What else was there to talk about? Didn\u2019t they discuss pretty much everything?", "\u201cCome sit next to me. Come and hear me out.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria said as she tapped on the chair next to her. She made it sound like she was only getting started.", "And just like that, four hours went by. After barely managing to send Charlotte Aria off, Seol Jihu staggered left and right in the hallway before grabbing onto the wall.", "\u2018God damn it\u2026\u2019", "He cursed unwittingly.", "The devil kept blabbering on and on without rest. He sneakily asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you have to go back and prepare to study sorcery for Lady Roselle?\u201d", "But the reply he got was, \u201cNo, I have to focus on research in the dream world, so I have to talk to my heart\u2019s content in the real world.\u201d", "When she refused to go back saying so, Seol Jihu almost jumped out of his seat in shock.", "\u2018Damn it, this is what she meant?\u2019", "Seol Jihu finally understood what Roselle meant when she said he would know the following day and asked for his cooperation.", "\u2018Like I will take this sitting down.\u2019", "Seol Jihu staggered back to his room. After practically collapsing on his bed, he forced himself to sleep. He planned to meet Roselle in his dream and say a thing or two to her.", "Of course, Seol Jihu did not end up going to the dream world. Roselle had not summoned him now that she had achieved her goal.", "\u2018You think I will let this end here?\u2019", "After waking up from a nice nap, Seol Jihu vowed to get his revenge.", "*", "Once the story that Jung Sua ran away spread, Sorg K\u00fchne took a hard measure.", "He regarded Jung Sua running away without acceding to the investigation as a confession of her taking part in the recent incident.", "And along with her crime of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, he declared Eva would no longer recognize Evangeline as an organization. In other words, he was telling them to get out of the city or disband.", "Naturally, Evangeline was no longer the Eva Royal Family\u2019s partner organization. Although Evangeline\u2019s members protested vehemently, saying that they had nothing to do with their representative\u2019s wrongdoings, Sorg K\u00fchne directed all the blame to Jung Sua.", "The fact that she was the representative played a huge role in this matter. It would be a different story if she was an ordinary member, but because the representative of an organization committed a crime, it was impossible to gloss over it.", "Similar to how Bok Jungsik ran away and White Rose disbanded, it was right for the entire organization to be punished.", "Just like that, the Evangeline organization collapsed. One thing that was surprising was that its members did not maintain the group and disbanded the organization completely.", "But thinking about it deeply, it made sense. They would have to leave Eva to stay as an organization, but moving to another city was not so easy.", "Not only was there no guarantee that another city would take them in, but they also lacked a leader who would shoulder the responsibility during the process.", "In truth, the organization had been on its last leg ever since Evangeline Rose died in the Banquet.", "And thus, the position of Eva Royal Family\u2019s partner organization became empty. However, everyone knew which organization would rise to take that spot.", "The queen\u2019s actions were more than telling.", "\u201cSeol Jihuuu!\u201d", "She came to Valhalla today as well. Recently, Charlotte Aria had been coming to Valhalla once every two days.", "Learning sorcery from Roselle while sleeping, waking up late and reviewing until dinner time, then racing to Valhalla. She looked for Seol Jihu and began to chatter, \u2018I did this today, I did that today.\u2019", "She was really like a daughter clinging onto her father who just came back from work and talking excitedly about how her day went.", "If it weren\u2019t for Sorg K\u00fchne restraining her, she most certainly would have visited Valhalla daily. And that was not an exaggeration.", "\u201cUwaaaaah.\u201d", "Seol Jihu sprawled down on the couch after being swamped by Charlotte Aria as usual. He had just sent the queen back, who was throwing a tantrum about wanting to sleep over.", "Sorg K\u00fchne spoke plainly.", "\u201cThank you for your hard work. I really don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201d", "\u201cCan\u2019t you moderate her somehow?\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne laughed inaudibly at Seol Jihu\u2019s candid question.", "\u201cI was briefed on the matter roughly. It seems that the queen views meeting you as a reward.\u201d", "\u201cA reward?\u201d", "\u201cRepresentative Seol, you are the only one whom she shares that witch with. Simply put, she is saying, \u2018I am working hard. Please praise me.\u2019\u201d", "Seol Jihu dropped his head at a loss for words.", "\u201c\u2026Is she studying hard?\u201d", "\u201cYes, she is truly giving it her best. Even I get scared when she is concentrating. It looks like she is interested in what she is learning, but being able to help her friend seems to be the real driving factor.\u201d", "Hearing this, Seol Jihu raised his head back up.", "\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear, at least.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you, but I sure am happy with it.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne chuckled and looked back at the door.", "\u201cHow about it? I know you are tired, but would you like to have dinner with me tonight?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t expect this inflexible old man to ask him out for dinner.", "\u201cSure.\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s go out. I know a good place.\u201d", "Seol Jihu agreed readily and got up. Sorg K\u00fchne then led him to a dilapidated restaurant in a remote alleyway.", "\u201cI apologize. This place is nothing grand, especially given the things you have done for the royal family.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I like restaurants like this anyways. It feels like it\u2019s run by a hidden master chef.\u201d", "\u201cFufu, he may not be a master chef, but he knows how to brew good wine. I drop by often when things are tough.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne entered the restaurant, saying that the dinner would be on him, and then proceeded to order food and drinks without hesitation.", "The wine really was excellent. Although Seol Jihu was a heavy eater, Sorg K\u00fchne was no pushover either. The old man ate and drank so much that Seol Jihu was beginning to worry whether his willowy body would be able to handle it all.", "\u201cIt feels like a dream.\u201d", "Only after emptying six glasses of wine did Sorg K\u00fchne start talking.", "\u201cCan you believe this situation? I can\u2019t. When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is pinch my cheeks a couple of times.\u201d", "He must have gotten heavily drunk as he began to chatter more.", "\u201cDo you know what the queen said to me yesterday? She said she\u2019s busy with research so I should take care of the administrative work by myself. She said I am the only one she trusts.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s harsh.\u201d", "\u201cIt is. It really is harsh!\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne nodded his head in a big motion.", "\u201cBut this level of harshness is something I can bear. In fact, I welcome it with open arms!\u201d", "He cackled before continuing.", "\u201cNever in my wildest dreams did I imagine that the queen would say she would learn magic. Hoho, isn\u2019t that great? Learning magic in this dangerous world. Whenever I see her concentrating in her seat, I think back to the late king\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu listened quietly.", "\u201cWhat I know for certain is that today\u2019s Eva is much better than yesterday\u2019s, and tomorrow\u2019s Eva will be much better than today\u2019s!\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne emptied another glass, then stared at Seol Jihu furtively.", "\u201cIt is all thanks to you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t me, someone would have done it. Though, she unfortunately died.\u201d", "\u201cI believe I know who you are talking about.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne nodded his head solemnly.", "\u201cEvangeline Rose. She was indeed an outstanding person. But to tell you the truth, I did not like her that much.\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. Evangeline Rose was an Earthling who had principles and also the ability to achieve her goals. I know she was over a thousand times more excellent than someone like Jung Sua, so much so that I would not dare compare them.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cBut she\u2026 how should I say this\u2026\u201d", "He paused before continuing.", "\u201cShe did not have any expectations. Rather than leaving it to you guys, I\u2019d rather take care of it myself. She was always like that.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne smiled bitterly.", "\u201cWell, I really can\u2019t blame her given the state of the government affairs back then, but I think it was wrong of her to part ways with the one and only Magician just because she did not agree with that person.\u201d", "With that, he emptied yet another glass.", "\u201cBut you are different.\u201d", "He wiped his mouth and smiled.", "\u201cEvangeline Rose would have been able to become the guardian of Eva. But that would have been it. She would not have been able to breathe life into a dying city and offer a brand new vision to me and the queen.\u201d", "Saying so, Sorg K\u00fchne took a deep breath and said.", "\u201cYou are the true savior of Eva.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled ambivalently.", "\u201cThank you for your kind words, but it\u2019s a little embarrassing.\u201d", "\u201cWhy? Is it not better than Haramark\u2019s War Hero?\u201d", "Seol Jihu and Sorg K\u00fchne burst into laughter simultaneously.", "\u201cOh yes, can you drop by the palace tomorrow?\u201d", "\u201cAgain?\u201d", "\u201cHow can you be in tears already? You will have to come a lot more often from now on.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne chuckled jovially as he took Seol Jihu\u2019s glass and poured more wine into it.", "\u201cDon\u2019t play hard to get and come. I was just given full authority over administrative work. I plan to talk to you about the districts within the city.\u201d", "\u2018Districts within the city?\u2019 Seol Jihu\u2019s eyebrow went up.", "\u201cDongchun Merchants and Red Hwaru each have one. We\u2019ll have to give one to the Triads. But then out of the eight districts, five will remain.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne grinned.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you need to bring back the certificates of lease for these districts?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped. Sorg K\u00fchne was saying he would put Valhalla in charge of five districts.", "\u201cHow you use them will be of no concern to me. Valhalla can manage them all directly or hire external help.\u201d", "What this signified was clear.", "\u201cBut if you plan on hiring external help, I hope you can pick ones that won\u2019t cause any problems.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne handed Seol Jihu\u2019s glass back to him and winked.", "\u201cI look forward to working with you, Partner Representative.\u201d", "\u201cLikewise.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took the glass without hesitation.", "\u201cI look forward to working with you too.\u201d", "\u201cFantastic.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne raised his glass, and Seol Jihu smiled brightly and raised his glass together with him.", "One toasted for Eva, and the other toasted for Paradise.", "Or so Seol Jihu thought.", "\u201cMay the two of you have a happy future together.\u201d", "\u201cFor Paradi\u2026 huh?\u201d", "Hearing Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s words which seemingly came out of nowhere, Seol Jihu jumped in a startle and put his glass down.", "However, Sorg K\u00fchne drank the wine nonchalantly. For some reason, he seemed to be having fun."]}
