I\u2019ll start talking instead.]", "It was true. Bok Jungsik definitely didn\u2019t seem very influential. And he had seen her act unbridled.

I\u2019ve already seen all that\u2019s there anyways.]", "He could hear a slightly bored tone in Flone\u2019s voice.

There were a lot of those blind idiots in my time too. ]", "\u201cThere were?\u201d", "[Yeah. To be honest, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t entertained the thought of going there either.

Except for this.]", "He suddenly felt his neck getting pulled.

I\u2019m not going to let you go.]", "\"But\u2026\"", "No matter how much he retorted, the black smoke tightly bound both his hands and legs.

Won\u2019t your thoughts of going disappear by then?]", "\u2018An entire year!\u2019", "It was impossible, no matter how much he thought about it, so he ducked his neck and began licking the pendant.", "[Ewwwwwww!]", "Flone shrieked as she drew back.", "After freeing his limbs, Seol Jihu was able to see the ghost flying far away while squirming in disgust.", "[You meanie! You know I hate that!]", "Hearing the upset tone echoing in his mind, Seol Jihu scratched his head.", "\u201cYou were gripping me too tightly.\u201d", "[I was worried!]", "\u201cI know.

It\u2019s not a place where living people should go. It\u2019s obvious that nothing good will come out of going there anyways\u2026\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t empty talk; Seol Jihu really did not have any intentions of going.", "Not only did the Nine Eyes signal all sorts of warnings to not go, but there was also no reason for him to go in the first place.", "[Good. You thought well.]", "Flone said with a slightly relieved voice.", "\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re curious as well?\u201d", "[My grandfather said too much curiosity was poisonous. There\u2019s no need to go to such\u2026 a scary place, just out of curiosity.]", "Hearing the depressed voice, Seol Jihu sniggered.", "\u201cWell, that\u2019s surprising. That even you have something to be afraid of.\u201d", "[Well, that\u2019s because my family is directly involved, and also because it happened when I was young\u2026]", "\u201cBut since you are already\u2014.\u201d", "\u2018\u2014dead, does it matter?\u2019 Seol Jihu didn\u2019t finish the sentence out loud.", "While he already knew Flone was strong, there were words he should say and words he shouldn\u2019t. He knew it was rude.", "[Me? What about me?]", "\u201cUh\u2026 strong.\u201d", "[Already strong? That doesn\u2019t even make sense.]", "But despite trying to switch topics, Seol Jihu broke into a cold sweat as Flone\u2019s characteristic persistency was activated.", "[Why? Do you not like me suddenly disappearing all the time?]", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d", "[Then should I always stick next to you?]", "He wondered how such a conclusion was reached, but unable to win against her persistent barrage of questions, he confessed to a certain extent.", "\u201cSo, uh\u2026 even if I don\u2019t personally enter the villa\u2026. As long as it\u2019s in range, you can\u2026\u201d", "When he couldn\u2019t continue speaking, the tweeting voice suddenly stopped.", "It was true that there was nothing inside the villa that could harm her. After all, she was a spirit, or in other words, already dead.", "Also, Flone was an evil spirit born from hundreds of years of resentment. She had been able to easily annihilate those terrible Parasites back then, too.", "Even if there was a monster inside, wouldn\u2019t it be simple for her to handle?", "As all sorts of thoughts came to Seol Jihu\u2019s mind, he carefully searched for her response.", "Flone who hadn\u2019t released her materialization had a dazed look on her face.", "\u2018Damn it! Me and my big mouth.\u2019", "He had made a mistake even while knowing Flone had a lot of regrets concerned with living.", "When he was just about to apologize out of guilt.", "[\u2026Ah.]", "Flone let out a stunned voice.", "[You\u2019re right!]", "Her eyes grew as large as lanterns.", "\"Excuse me?\"", "[You\u2019re right. Why was I afraid?]", "Then like a child who discovered something interesting, she became excited and floated in the air.", "\u201cF-Flone?\u201d", "[I\u2019m going out for a bit!]", "And Flone flew away just like that.", "Seol Jihu was left staring endlessly at the spirit that was now becoming a small dot on the horizon.", "\u2018\u2026She didn\u2019t know?\u2019", "No, that wasn\u2019t it. She might have been instinctively afraid because of the trauma that she was induced with when she was a child.", "Or so he thought, until he could see the quickly returning Flone.", "Seol hastily gripped the railings using all his strength after vaguely realizing why she was flying towards him.", "A moment later, on the third stairway of the Carpe Diem building, a strange scene of a spirit pulling on the collar of a young man holding onto the handrail like a cicada, unfolded.", "\u201cNo. I\u2019m never going there.\u201d", "[Why~! Let\u2019s go~!]", "\"I\u2019m scared, okay?\"", "[But you don\u2019t even have to go in~! I\u2019ll go in by myself!]", "\"I don\u2019t want to!

I\u2019ll kill you!]", "Seol Jihu flinched hearing Flone\u2019s threat.", "\"No! We don\u2019t even know what\u2019s inside!\"", "[It doesn\u2019t matter!]", "In reply to Seol Jihu\u2019s screams, Flone brightly shouted as if she never cared at all.", "[After all, I\u2019m already dead!]"]}
