And now, so were indigo and violet.", "The past Seol Jihu may have disregarded this as something insignificant. But after unlocking the right side and experiencing just how complicated the blue color was, Seol Jihu felt his shoulders get heavy.", "He had trouble understanding the Choice of Destiny alone, but now he had to figure out how the two additional colors of the right direction worked. To be frank, he did not have the faintest idea of how these two new abilities worked.", "But there was one thing he knew. Thinking about these two abilities in terms of their connection with Future Vision, they had to have powers on a completely different dimension than his other abilities.", "Fate Pioneering and Stellar Evolution.", "Just like Gula and Ian said, perhaps these two abilities were the key weapon and shield to combat the Parasite Queen\u2019s schemes against humanity.", "At least, that\u2019s what he thought.", "\u201cWheeew.\u201d", "In the end, he had no way to find out now. He just had to face it head-on and figure it out, as he had always done.", "Seol Jihu heaved out the breath he had been holding in. Then, he turned the messages off one by one. The list of skills he could learn as a High Ranker, which had been covered by the messages, showed up.", "Level 5, or the realm of High Rankers, was where Earthlings started to be considered experts. Fittingly, he saw several skills that sounded rather extraordinary, like Sword Qi.[2]", "\u2018Hm?\u2019", "Two particular skills caught Seol Jihu\u2019s attention.", "\u2018Curse\u2026 vengeance\u2026?\u2019", "[Nemesis: Misfortune-delivering Curse Spear]\u2014A spear that distorts the law of causality to twist the target\u2019s luck and deliver him or her misfortune.

Soon, a look of worry blanketed his face.

The future isn\u2019t the only thing that received momentum.]", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. This was the first time Gula was saying something like this. Considering that she was a god, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t think she was saying this just to console him. Most likely, there were secrets that he had yet to discover among the numerous newly evolved abilities.", "\u2018I understand. Thank you so much!\u2019", "After bowing respectfully to the statue to express his gratitude, Seol Jihu left the temple with light steps.", "And while Gula was gazing at the spot Seol Jihu was previously standing on, a sensual voice suddenly rang out in the empty space.", "[See, I told you he would like it.]", "The voice belonged to Luxuria, the Goddess of Lust.", "[Look how grateful he was. And isn\u2019t this the first time he didn\u2019t complain about his class name?]", "[I just can\u2019t understand.]", "Gula grumbled when Luxuria boasted.", "[Just what is good about a name like that\u2026? High Mana Lancer sounds much better.]", "[How crude.]", "[Hmph. I let it go this time since you insisted so much, but when he becomes Level 6, I will make sure mana is in his name!]", "If Seol Jihu heard this, he would surely convulse violently. The frightened Luxuria quickly stopped her.", "[Don\u2019t. What are you going to do if my child goes astray?]", "[Your child? At the moment, he is without a doubt,\u00a0my child.]", "Inside the temple, the bickering of two goddesses continued for a long time.", "*", "After leaving the temple, Seol Jihu stopped and tilted his head up.

He finally reached Level 5.", "He was now a High Ranker, basically, one of the experts who could walk around with their chests puffed out. He could safely say that no one in Paradise could ignore his strength.", "Remembering how he participated in an expedition as a porter back when he was just a Level 1 Warrior, he was quite moved. But the class advancement wasn\u2019t the only reason he was happy.", "[Class: Lv 5. Lance of Nemesis]", "Looking at this class name, a broad grin appeared on his face. He glanced at it once, twice, thrice, and then some more. He didn\u2019t get tired no matter how many times he saw it.", "Because it was cool.", "In truth, he hadn\u2019t expected such a cool name. He would have been happy to simply lose the word \u2018mana\u2019. As Seol Jihu had vowed to serve another goddess if even the \u2018ma\u2019 of \u2018mana\u2019 was in his new class name, he couldn\u2019t be happier that Gula accepted his request.", "\u201cHic.\u201d", "He was so touched that he even teared up. He remembered the miserable days when he was too embarrassed to even reveal his class name.", "But those days were over now. When he thought about saying, \u2018Hello, I am Level 5 High Ranker, Lance of Nemesis, Seol Jihu,\u2019 he felt something welling up inside him.", "Although Fate Pioneering and Stellar Evolution suddenly popped up in his head, Seol Jihu shook the thought off. He wanted to enjoy being happy, at least for today.", "The streaks of daylight shining down from the sky seemed to lighten up his future. Feeling happier than ever before, Seol Jihu wiped his tears and skipped down the stairs with feathery steps.", "[Mana this, mana that! Just what\u2019s wrong with you!?]", "[What\u2019s so wrong about the word mana!?]", "And all the while, he had no clue what the two goddesses were talking about back in the temple.", "*", "It usually took Seol Jihu ten minutes to get to the Carpe Diem office from the temple.

Is Miss Phi Sora in her room?\u2019", "Snooping around, Seol Jihu caught sight of something black. The moment he strained his eyes to take a closer look, it disappeared in the direction of his room.", "Feeling that something was out of place, he followed the mysterious afterimage to his room. There, he saw a black puff of smoke curled up in a corner.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face glowed up.", "\u201cFlone!!\u201d", "He shouted joyfully.", "[Hmph.]", "But what returned was a thorny hmph. The top part of the smoke even turned itself back.", "\u201cFlone?\u201d", "[Hmph!]", "Heaving out a strong snort, Flone went under the bed as if she didn\u2019t want to see him.", "\u2018Ah.\u2019", "Remembering how Flone always stayed by his side while he was in a coma and no one was around, Seol Jihu belatedly went \u2018Ah\u2019.", "Flone had to be hurt. Even though he was forced to return to Earth by Jang Maldong, he had left without saying a word. To make matters worse, even when he returned, he tossed her aside in his room, never greeting her once, and went on about his business.", "When he thought about how she supported him during the war and how she saved Teresa in his place, he felt even more apologetic.", "\u201cFloneee.\u201d", "Seol Jihu apologized, telling her to come out, and even sweeping the underside of the bed with a gunny sack.", "\u201cKyaang!\u201d An angry voice rang out along with a strong pull from his hand. Seeing a clear bite mark on the half-chewed-off gunny sack, Seol Jihu awkwardly scratched his head.", "Then suddenly, a bright idea popped up in his head", "\u201cFlone, I brought you a present~\u201d", "Flone still didn\u2019t react. Seol Jihu rummaged through his baggage. Because Flone was a ghost, he had to get her something different from what he got everyone else. Thankfully, he managed to come up with a good gift idea after much deliberation.", "Seol Jihu sat down on his chair and stole a glance behind him. The word \u2018present\u2019 must have piqued Flone\u2019s interest, as a single strand of smoke peeked out from under the bed.", "When the smoke noticed Seol Jihu\u2019s gaze, it started to hide again. Seol Jihu quickly spoke.", "\u201cThe pendant. You said it was a keepsake of your mother, right?\u201d", "The smoke stopped, hearing the word \u2018keepsake\u2019.", "[Yeah.]", "An apathetic voice rang out. Seol Jihu quickly gestured at her to come over.", "\u201cI\u2019ll show you something cool.\u201d", "[Cool?]", "\u201cYou\u2019ll love it, Flone.\u201d", "Hearing how confident the young man was, Flone came out hesitantly before flying next to Seol Jihu.", "[Hmph, I\u2019m just taking a look.]", "\u201cAi, don\u2019t be like that. We are friends, aren\u2019t we? I just didn\u2019t have time earlier. Please forgive me.\u201d", "Acting cute, Seol Jihu massaged the area he believed were her shoulders. Then, he carefully placed the pendant at the center of the desk.", "The marvelous artisanry of the pendant was noticeable no matter how many times he saw it. But because it was an artifact from hundreds of years ago, there were spots that had faded and discolored.", "\u201cWatch this.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took out a plastic cup and filled 3/4ths of it with water and 1/4th of it with ammonia. Next, he placed the pendant inside before taking it out 30 minutes later. Using a mild, neutral detergent and mixing it into a bowl of lukewarm water, he washed the pendant clean.", "Next, when he gently scrubbed the pendant with a toothbrush and wiped the water off with a towel, a soft exclamation burst out.", "[Wow\u2026!]", "It wasn\u2019t a difficult process. But every time the toothbrush stroked the pendant, the green discoloration disappeared, and the pendant\u2019s old brilliance returned. As Flone had never seen such a thing, she couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.", "[Wow, wooooow\u2026.]", "\u201cAll we have to do now is wash the pendant clean in lukewarm water and dry it under sunlight.\u201d", "Showing her true figure before Seol Jihu even noticed, Flone stared at the sparkling pendant in a daze. As far as she was concerned, Seol Jihu had just used a mysterious magic spell.", "\u201cHow is it?\u201d", "[Refreshing. I feel like I just took a bath.]", "Seeing her stretching joyfully, Seol Jihu smiled.", "**", "Same time.", "Phi Sora was sitting on her bed two rooms over from Seol Jihu\u2019s. Currently, she was in deep contemplation as she looked down at a box.", "Anger was nowhere to be seen, and only confusion remained on her face.", "\u201cGod, this smartass\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora slicked her hair back in frustration.", "\u201cWhat is this?\u201d", "Murmuring to herself, she picked up the item inside the box with her thumb and index finger.", "\u201cWhy did he give me this?\u201d", "What she clawed up was none other than\u2026 underwear. To be precise, it was a set consisting of a bra and a matching pair of panties.", "And a fairly classy one, at that.", "To be honest, she liked the gift if she was talking about it in an isolated context. Not only did the passionate red color suit her, but she also liked the rose patterns that were on the underwear. The texture was soft as well.", "\u2018It\u2019s so expensive\u2026.\u2019", "Even at a glance, she could tell that it was from a famous underwear brand. When she saw the 210,000 Won price tag, her eyes almost popped out of their sockets.", "\u2018He surprisingly has good taste.\u2019", "Right, she accepted this and was happy. But there was just one problem.", "\u201cWhy the hell did he give this to me?\u201d", "She just couldn\u2019t figure out why Seol Jihu gave her this particular gift. It wasn\u2019t as if she was his girlfriend. It was too expensive and high quality to be a joke gift, and it didn\u2019t seem like he had any malicious intentions either. Moreover, she never told him about her size.", "The truth was that Seol Jihu was just being stupid. Because Yoo Seonhwa praised him that one time, he thought other people would like this gift as well.", "But because Phi Sora didn\u2019t know Seol Jihu well enough to know this, it was only natural that she agonized over the meaning of this gift.", "In the end, after pondering for a long time, Phi Sora tried on the bra.", "Soon\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s eyes widened and she blinked quickly while looking down at her chest.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect size?\u201d", "1. A Buddhism concept. The Three Realms refer to the world of past, present, and future respectively. ", "2. Again, Sword Qi isn\u2019t sword-specific. It\u2019s more suitable to call this Weapon Qi (I\u2019m just using Sword Qi since that is the norm in Korean). ", "3. Floral Substitution (\u79fb\u82b1\u63a5\u6728) literally means grafting a flowering tree to another tree. It means secretly swapping something out through an elaborate method. "]}
