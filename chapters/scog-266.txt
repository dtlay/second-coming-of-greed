I\u2019ve always been thankful for that.\u201d", "\u201cQueen, I swear I did not conspire with the Alliance.\u201d", "\u201cI know, I know, I\u2019m sure there is a reason you were in contact with those thugs. Evangeline Rose did the same thing. I know you were both doing it for me.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I was only communicating with them to keep an eye on them, and even when I called them recently, it was only to tell them to stay put.\u201d", "Jung Sua took this opportunity to pour out words of explanation.", "\u201cBut my situation is so intricately woven that no one believes me.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria patted Jung Sua\u2019s back.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure there has been a misunderstanding. I will resolve it for you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s all because of me\u2026 I think it might be easier if\u2014\u201d", "\u201cHalt. I told you, trust me. Remember when you acted all high and mighty and told me to stop bottling up my feelings and rely on you? Looks like it\u2019s time for me to say that to you now.\u201d", "\u201cW-When did I act high and mighty?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria consoled Jung Sua for a while. Once the latter\u2019s complexion turned brighter, the queen told her to rest well and saw her off.", "Less than ten minutes after Jung Sua left, a voice rang out from the other side of the door.", "\u201cYour Majesty, the royal administrator Sorg K\u00fchne would like an audience.\u201d", "Hearing this, Charlotte Aria\u2019s tranquil expression changed.", "\u201cWhew\u2026\u201d", "Pressing her forehead with her dainty hand, she breathed out a long sigh. She looked reluctant. However, she replied as if she didn\u2019t have any other choice.", "\u201cLet him in.\u201d", "*", "Valhalla held an opening ceremony as soon as the official registration was over.", "Kim Hannah said the purpose of the ceremony was to covertly announce, \u2018Eva belongs to us and the Triads,\u2019 but on the surface, it was a simple event to tell the world, \u2018We made an organization.\u2019", "Of course, it had internal significance as well. No longer a small team with comparatively fewer restrictions, this ceremony would be the chance for the new organization\u2019s members to kick-off together.", "Despite the grandeur of the word, in reality, the opening ceremony was really a gathering for the members to say, \u2018Let\u2019s work well together.\u2019", "Before starting the opening ceremony, Kim Hannah drew up an insignia to represent Valhalla \u2014 an intersecting drawing of a white spear and shield \u2014 which Seol Jihu liked quite a bit.", "Putting the insignia on a golden flag and hanging it on the building\u2019s main entrance, the building\u2019s splendor was elevated by a level.", "To be honest, Seol Jihu was worried whether people would even know about this ceremony, but his worry turned out to be in vain.", "\u2014Congratulations! You finally made an organization!", "\u201cIt was actually a bit late. Things happened, you see.\u201d", "\u2014I heard. I have many questions to ask, but first and foremost, have you met Charlotte Aria?", "\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d", "\u2014Ufufufufu. She\u2019s going to be a tough nut to crack.", "First, he received a call from Haramark\u2019s Teresa Hussey.", "\u2014I heard what happened. You actually waged war on your first day there?", "\u201cThat\u2019s what ended up happening\u2026\u201d", "\u2014How unfortunate. I should have listened to Agnes.

Come in. Grab some food.\u201d", "\u201cAigoo, thank you. Then I\u2019ll be shameless\u2026 Hehe!\u201d", "Park Dongchun rubbed his hands together as he spoke subserviently. Then, he really panted like a dying horse because the cafeteria was on the 10th floor.", "\u201cHuk! Huk!\u201d", "After walking up the stairs in agony, he put down his heavy bag and drew deep breaths.", "\u201cS-Sorry\u2026 my stamina isn\u2019t that good\u2026.\u201d", "He collected his breath before sighing.", "\u201cHeh\u2026 okay\u2014\u201d", "Kuhum. After clearing his throat, he untied the stringed bag he\u2019d lugged over. He then placed a small box on the table before respectfully handing it over with both hands.", "\u201cThis is my gift to Representative Seol to congratulate Valhalla\u2019s founding.\u201d", "\u201cGift?\u201d", "\u201cAah, it\u2019s nothing special, just a small show of sincerity. It\u2019s really nothing, so I hope you won\u2019t feel uncomfortable. You can take a look. It\u2019s true!\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared at the luxurious, palm-sized wooden box with a renewed look.", "\u201cCigarettes?\u201d", "Inside the box were dozens of neatly-packed cigarettes.", "\u201cHave you ever heard of cigarettes that are good for your body?\u201d", "Park Dongchun spoke confidently.", "\u201cHuhu, they\u2019re real and the true pride of the Dongchun Merchants. We haven\u2019t started selling them yet, but we\u2019re confident they\u2019ll blow up the market once we figure out how to mass-produce them!\u201d", "\u201cOh? There are cigarettes that are good for your body?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s true. You see the dry grass inside? The thing that\u2019s glowing like delicate moonlight? That\u2019s not tobacco, but moonlight leaf. It\u2019s processed from a rare leaf that only grows in Paradise.\u201d", "Park Dongchun gave a long explanation, piquing Seol Jihu\u2019s interest.", "A cigarette that is good for the body? For heavy smokers, it was really the cigarette of their dreams.", "\u201cIf you can bring them to Earth, they really will blow up. An instant sensation, for sure.\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes, but these moonlight leaves are hard to find in humanity\u2019s territory\u2026.\u201d", "Park Dongchun scratched his head as he smacked his lips. He looked like he wanted to say something, but chose to remain silent.", "Seol Jihu closed the box. A gift like this, it should be fine to receive it.", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "\u201cAyu~ Not at all. Just give it a try and let me know what you think about it later.\u201d", "Park Dongchun laughed foolishly before taking out something else, saying, \u201cAnd also\u2014\u201d", "This time, it was a large parcel.", "\u201cPlease take this as well.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing big, just an offering with divine energy.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cAn offering?\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes, I heard the rumors\u2026 I hope it can be of help\u2026 Hehe!\u201d", "Seol Jihu planned to refuse the gift at first, but it was hard to do so given Seo Yuhui\u2019s circumstance. When it came to offerings, he wasn\u2019t in any position to be picky.", "\u2018T-This person\u2026 he\u2019s pretty shrewd.\u2019", "That wasn\u2019t all. Park Dongchun kept saying it wasn\u2019t anything special but continued to take out gift after gift. He had brought one for each member of Valhalla, with Flone being the only exception. He even brought top-quality food to feed Little Chick!", "Seol Jihu chuckled, not knowing whether he should be happy or flustered. Of course, he knew why Park Dongchun was doing this. Park Dongchun was trying to gain his favor.", "From what Kim Hannah told him, Park Dongchun had apparently given them a hint about the Alliance\u2019s ambush before it happened. While he didn\u2019t reveal everything, the hint had been obvious enough for anyone to understand it.", "In a way, that was a contribution.", "Furthermore, on the night of the incident, the Dongchun Merchants and Red Hwaru had refused to move even with the Alliance\u2019s request. And now, the Eva Alliance no longer existed, and even the organization, Evangeline, was on the brink of destruction.", "Only the Dongchun Merchants and Red Hwaru were untouched.", "\u2018He must be anxious.\u2019", "To be frank, Valhalla could easily ruin the two organizations by tying them together with the rest, but Kim Hannah suggested leaving them be for now.", "Having a merchant group in the city was important for times of emergency, and she said that a talented merchant like Park Dongchun was hard to come by.", "\u2018Now that I think about it, Mister Kazuki praised him too.\u2019", "In truth, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t have any plans to ruin the two remaining organizations. But that didn\u2019t mean he planned to leave them be.", "If they would surrender the interests they had been enjoying and backed off on their own, he was ready to spare them. Of course, that was under the premise that they would follow Valhalla\u2019s rules.", "\u201cOh yeah, I heard from Kim Hannah.\u201d", "\u201cAh, ah, it\u2019s not worth your mention\u2026 Well done! You truly did excellent work! I always hated those pieces of trash. You have no idea how happy I was when I heard they were all rounded up!\u201d", "Park Dongchun spoke excitedly as he clapped.", "Weren\u2019t those people your allies? Seol Jihu chuckled inwardly before continuing to speak.", "\u201cI like people who keep their promises.\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "Park Dongchun blinked rapidly.", "\u201cYou made a promise with me at the border region, remember? I read Kim Hannah\u2019s report recently. It seems you\u2019ve been keeping true to that promise.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 Haha! Of course, who do you think I am? I am the man of wits! No, the man of trust, Promise Park! To become a magnate, keeping your promises with your clients is a must!\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled at Park Dongchun\u2019s chatter, then said.", "\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you sometime soon. Not today though, and with Red Hwaru\u2019s Rouge-nim as well. You two helped us in the last incident. I feel I should give proper thanks to both of you.\u201d", "Park Dongchun wasn\u2019t an idiot who wouldn\u2019t understand what this meant. His complexion instantly brightened.", "\u201cThank you! Thank you!\u201d", "He bowed multiple times, almost too subserviently, before looking up with a warm smile.", "\u201cAh, speaking of which\u2026 may I bring someone else along as well?\u201d", "\u201cWho?\u201d", "\u201cA lady named Shin Sang-Ah. Do you know her?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened. This time, he was really surprised. He never expected to hear that name from Park Dongchun.", "Shin Sang-Ah. She and Seol Jihu were from the same Area, and they had met during the Tutorial. Seol Jihu got to know her by stopping Kang Seok from harassing her.", "From what he could remember, she became a Priest after the awakening ceremony in the Neutral Zone, leading her to a rose-colored future.", "\u201cYes, I do. Is this really the Miss Shin Sang-Ah I know?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. We found out by coincidence as well. Because my subordinates kept begging me to do something about her mouth\u2026\u201d", "\u201cMouth?\u201d", "\u201cN-Nothing. Anyway, if it\u2019s alright with you, I\u2019d love to bring her with me\u2026 Sang-Ah has been wanting to see you as well.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine. I want to see her too.\u201d", "He had been wondering about his friends from the Neutral Zone, so he had no reason to refuse this offer.", "\u201cIs Miss Sang-Ah doing well?\u201d", "\u201cYes, she\u2019s well. Too well. Now if only we can do something about her mouth\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYou said that before too. What do you mean by that?\u201d", "\u201cAt first, I was curious just how bad it must be to make the other guys throw a fit\u2026 Well, it\u2019s good that she explains in detail. That\u2019s all good, but every time anyone tries to ask her something, she just goes off, saying, \u2018This happened during the Tutorial\u2026\u2019\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s simple question had unexpectedly turned into Park Dongchun ranting on and on, but the atmosphere became brighter in exchange.", "It was then. Just as Seol Jihu was happily listening to news about Shin Sang-Ah, a man walked into the room.", "\u201cLeader.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea approached Seol Jihu and whispered in his ear.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll need to come down real quick.\u201d", "\u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d", "\u201cThere is trouble in the lobby.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea sounded quite serious. Seol Jihu tilted his head. Wasn\u2019t Kim Hannah in the lobby? There was trouble when she was in charge of guiding people who came for the opening ceremony?", "Seol Jihu turned to Park Dongchun. The latter must have taken the hint as he nodded and spoke.", "\u201cAigoo~ I must have been here too long. I\u2019m fine, so please greet the other guests!\u201d", "\u201cYes, feel free to grab something to eat while you wait.\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll introduce myself to everyone else in the meanwhile as well\u2026\u201d", "Park Dongchun looked left and right, his eyes flashing.", "Seol Jihu quickly got up. As soon as he made his way to the stairs, Marcel Ghionea followed after him.", "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but Miss Kim Hannah seemed to be taken aback.\u201d", "Kim Hannah was taken aback? That was hard to believe.", "\u201cWhat, did Eva\u2019s queen come to visit? Or was it Evangeline\u2019s representative?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s neither, but\u2026\u201d", "At that moment, they arrived at the first floor. Before fully taking the last few steps of the staircase, Seol Jihu looked around the first-floor lobby.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "He could see dozens of people waiting in front of the main entrance, watching.", "\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed. Quickly running down, he saw Kim Hannah\u2019s back. She looked calm on the outside, but she was stiff like a frog in front of a snake.", "Soon\u2026", "\u201cEh?\u201d", "As Seol Jihu approached her, he could see a figure peeking out toward Kim Hannah\u2019s right.", "\u201cThere he is.\u201d", "A woman leaned forward slightly with her hands behind her back.", "Seol Jihu paused subconsciously. The woman\u2019s face was familiar.", "She boasted dazzling beauty, and after seeing Seol Jihu\u2026", "\u201cHello!\u201d", "\u2026She gave a beaming smile and shouted in a bright, clear voice."]}
