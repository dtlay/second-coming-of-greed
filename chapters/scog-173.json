Undying Diligence walked forward.", "Seol Jihu realized he could no longer stand still.", "If his only choice was to die, he figured he would give his all. Dealing an effective blow might be too much to ask, but if he died without making a single attempt, he felt like he would regret it as he drew his last breath.", "When his thoughts reached this point, a tiny bean-sized courage emerged in his heart.", "Seol Jihu fixed his posture and tightly grabbed his spear with his trembling hands. Undying Diligence nodded his head.", "\u201cGood. That\u2019s what I like to see.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shot his eyes open before kicking off the ground. Shouting to shake off fear, he squeezed out every ounce of his strength and thrust forward.", "The Ice Spear scattered golden particles of light as it cut through the air. But Undying Diligence remained standing in the same spot, avoiding the attack just by tilting his head to the side.", "Seol Jihu must have expected this response, as he immediately changed his attack from a thrust to a strike.", "In that instant, Undying Diligence\u2019s knees bent at a right angle. His upper body tilted severely, and Seol Jihu\u2019s spear only struck the empty air.", "As if he had been waiting for this moment, Seol Jihu immediately cut down with his spear, but\u2026.", "\u201cStop playing around.\u201d", "Undying Diligence muttered coldly before using his arm touching the ground as a pivot to spin.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s spear grazed his ribs and stabbed the ground.", "Rising up like a swallow, Undying Diligence dusted his hand.", "\u201cIs that all?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes shook violently.", "Setting aside his opponent\u2019s physical abilities that surpassed his wildest imagination\u2026 Thrust, Slice, and Cut \u2014 he had performed the techniques he was most confident in, yet he had failed to even graze Undying Diligence\u2019s hair.", "Not to mention, Undying Diligence had only avoided his attacks and did not even attempt to counterattack in any way.", "It was almost as if he was being tested.", "Seol Jihu quickly pulled out his spear. Just as he was about to take a step back, he paused.", "He was rather close to Undying Diligence.", "Since it looked like Undying Diligence had no desire to attack\u2026", "Pang! He activated the Festina Earring.", "Using the wind enveloping himself, Seol Jihu rushed forward with a gust. After closing the distance in an instant, he curled his body. And just like when he defeated the Orc Champion, he thrust his spear using the springing force of Flash Step.", "It was then\u2026.", "\u2018Ah.\u2019", "He suddenly met a pair of indifferent eyes. An undefinable sense of despair flit past his head. It was as if it was telling him, \u2018This isn\u2019t right.\u2019", "However, he had already spread his body, and his spear was traveling up.", "Undying Diligence raised his finger.", "Tak! The finger easily blocked the spear tip that was emanating anti-evil energy. No matter how hard Seol Jihu tried to push his spear forward, it refused to budge.", "And when Undying Diligence bent his finger slightly, Seol Jihu felt his center of gravity shift down.", "The moment Seol Jihu fell on his butt, he was stunned. He had expected as much, but imagination and reality were completely different.", "When he looked up in a daze, he saw a withered face that had lost all interest.", "Undying Diligence calmly examined his finger. It was slightly burnt as though someone had extinguished a cigarette on it.", "\u201cJust a fool who has the anti-evil power only\u2026.\u201d", "He rubbed his index finger with his thumb and clicked his tongue.", "Their target was a Star who even the Queen they served was afraid of. This Star was more valuable than the Tigol Fortress they conquered through an all-out war.", "Naturally, this Star had to have power that would surprise him.", "As this was what Undying Diligence thought, it was reasonable for him to judge the \u2018current\u2019 Seol Jihu to be lacking.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, but since you made the choice, I guess there is nothing I can do.\u201d", "The moment he raised his foot to crush Seol Jihu like an insect\u2014", "Tududuk! Undying Diligence\u2019s neck made a frightening sound while twisting back.", "Flone, who was helping out Seol Jihu\u2019s comrades, had raced back after seeing Seol Jihu in danger.", "\u201cHoh.\u201d", "Undying Diligence stared at the ghost glaring at him and exclaimed.", "\u201cRight. You were here as well.\u201d", "Poof! With a grin, Undying Diligence transformed into a mist and shot up into the air. Flone chased after him right away.", "Red and black mists drew spirals in the air while emanating a terrifying energy.", "\u201cFlone!\u201d", "Seol Jihu shot up and created a Mana Spear, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to throw it. Because Flone was fighting too close to Undying Diligence, there was a chance he would accidentally hit her.", "[Die! Dieeeee!]", "Flone attacked Undying Diligence with violent hand movements, but she didn\u2019t perform any better than Seol Jihu.", "\u201cYour strength is decent\u2026\u201d", "Undying Diligence was appraising her attacks while dodging them by paper-thin margins.", "\u201cBut you lack experience.\u201d", "Undying Diligence revealed himself from the mist and smiled brightly.", "\u201cLike a young lady tackling a problem with overconfidence, not knowing how the world works.\u201d", "As if to destroy his blabbering mouth, Flone clawed at him viciously. However, Undying Diligence reached out and easily snatched her hand.", "[!?]", "Having been grabbed when she hadn\u2019t even materialized, Flone struggled in a fluster.", "[Eek! Eeeeeeek!]", "Undying Diligence smiled like he was watching a child throw a tantrum. Then, he poured his energy into his hand.", "From the part making contact with Flone, a blood-colored aura seeped in and dyed the black smoke red.", "[Aaaaaaaack!]", "Flone let out a shrill shriek. The color of her smoke became light, and it began to fall from the sky.", "\u201cYou must be at least a couple hundred years old\u2026. You\u2019re worthy of being absorbed.\u201d", "As Undying Diligence descended slowly, a satisfied smile appeared on his face. He was obtaining an unexpected gain, so it was obvious why he would be happy.", "Undying Diligence reached towards Flone, who was lying limp on the ground, twitching.", "Seol Jihu burst out with a roar of frustration.", "\u201cFloneeee!\u201d", "Bellowing loudly, he blindly rushed forward. Undying Diligence glanced at the young man as a hint of irritation flashed across his face.", "\u201cAnnoying!\u201d", "His arm darted sideways like a dragon.", "That was the end. Seol Jihu\u2019s vision suddenly darkened, and when he opened his eyes back up, he realized he was staring at the sky.", "Flying through the sky\u2014 Thud! He struck the ground.", "\u201cKuhuk!\u201d", "Fresh blood spurted out of his mouth.", "And\u2026.", "\u201cKuk.\u201d", "The pain\u2026", "\u201cHuaaaaaak!\u201d", "\u2026came earlier than he thought it would.", "From the hole in his chest, fresh blood poured out. Seol Jihu bounced on the ground several times before finally coming to a stop. His limbs flailed left and right, and his body trembled.", "\u201cHuk! Huuk!\u201d", "As Seol Jihu panted out of breath, a shadow was cast over him.", "\u201cWell, still\u2026\u201d", "Undying Diligence walked toward him and raised his foot. Since the young man possessed the anti-evil attribute, making sure he was dead was the right thing to do.", "\u201cSince you brought me such an excellent nutrient, I\u2019ll send you off painlessly.\u201d", "And just as he was about to slam his foot down, a knight cut between them with her heater shield held up.", "The silver shield flashed with a holy aura.", "\u201cKeuk\u2014!\u201d", "Teresa furrowed her brows as she was pushed back.", "Undying Diligence opened his mouth with a surprised expression.", "\u201cOho! Princess of Haramark, have you gotten stronger since the last time we met? No.\u201d", "Looking at the holy aura flowing around her longsword and shield, he made an understanding look.", "\u201cI see, you didn\u2019t get stronger but got a couple of useful weapons.\u201d", "\u201cTake him and run! Hurry!\u201d", "Ignoring Undying Diligence\u2019s comment, Teresa turned her head half-way and shouted.", "Undying Diligence\u2019s eyebrows perked up. A blonde-haired girl ran up to the young man convulsing sporadically and began to frantically chant a spell.", "\u201cMiss Maria!\u201d", "\u201cFuck! Shut up!\u201d", "\u201cHurry!\u201d", "\u201cYou think I\u2019m staying here for fun!? He has to be able to move before we can do anything!\u201d", "\u2018Take him and run?\u2019", "With the fortress conquered, there was nowhere they could run to. To be precise, they would be killed even if they ran.", "But the one saying this was the princess who chose to fight rather than escape. Naturally, Undying Diligence felt that it was a bit out of place.", "And it wasn\u2019t just the princess.", "\u201cUwaaaaaah!\u201d", "A black warrior charged in with a shining halberd in hand. Undying Diligence waited apathetically before swinging his fist like a bolt of lightning and sending him flying.", "\u201cYou bastard!\u201d", "Next, he kicked the chin of a battle maiden swinging her mace. He then grabbed the longswords of two swordswomen attacking from the left and right and pulled them together.", "Oh Rahee and Phi Sora clashed together before being knocked back.", "\u201cHm\u2026.\u201d", "Undying Diligence tilted his head as he stared at the four Warriors groaning on the ground around him.", "As soon as he knocked out the human carrying anti-evil attribute, Haramark\u2019s princess and the surrounding warriors had rushed in to help.", "Clearly, they were all trying to save that one young man.", "As the concept of camaraderie did not exist in Undying Diligence\u2019s mind, he couldn\u2019t help but imagine a certain possibility.", "And thinking about it now, he had heard that their target was a dead Star, not a shining Star.", "\u2018A dead Star\u2026.\u2019", "Undying Diligence\u2019s evaluation of Seol Jihu had plummeted, but it began to rise once again. Although it was only an intuition, he felt like there was something about the young man he didn\u2019t get.", "He was intrigued once again. So, he turned to a few of his subordinates who were in the middle of killing a group of soldiers, and opened his mouth.", "\u201cStop.\u201d", "Four Nosferatus stopped immediately and stood still.", "Undying Diligence slowly walked towards Teresa, who was the only one left standing.", "\u201cFuck! Fuck!\u2019", "Maria was cursing meaninglessly while focusing on healing Seol Jihu.", "She screamed with a pressing voice.", "\u201cGet up! Snap out of it!! You son of a bitch, wake up!\u201d", "She was using one healing spell after the other, but the wound in his chest was still closing slowly.", "Whatever it was that injured him, it seemed to have a power capable of hindering recovery.", "And when Seol Jihu finally coughed out a breath of air\u2026", "\u201cPlease, please\u2026! Hieeeek!\u201d", "The desperately pleading Maria suddenly let out a shriek. She scurried back crazily.", "It was because Undying Diligence was walking towards her while holding Teresa by her neck.", "Although Seol Jihu had partially recovered, he had yet to recover from his state of shock.", "When Undying Diligence reached out and grabbed him by his neck, he was pulled up seamlessly. Although Undying Diligence could have killed him here and now, his diligent personality pushed him to see things through to the end.", "To be more precise, he sought efficiency.", "He could clearly see that the Parasites had taken over the battlefield. Their only remaining task was to search for the Star.", "To do this, they would have to scour the fortress or track every single escapee. And this would naturally take time.", "On the other hand, if they could finish off their main objective, the rest could be left to their underlings. It was Undying Diligence\u2019s plan to return to Tigol Fortress with the other two Army Commanders as soon as they accomplished their mission.", "After all, the faster they returned to the fortress, the greater the chance they would have to protect it.", "And for that reason, their target\u2014 the dead Star\u2014 had to be in this place.", "So, he looked back and forth between Seol Jihu and Teresa.", "\u201cIs this that human? If not, do you know who it is?\u201d", "If it were the former, Seol Jihu would be taken away. If it were the latter, Seol Jihu would be killed.", "Knowing this, Teresa only glared hatefully. Undying Diligence promptly threw her to the side as if he hadn\u2019t expected anything.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a gift for the Queen. Do not kill her.\u201d", "With that, he began to walk towards the girl who was kneeling on the ground with both of her arms tied together.", "\u201cAnswer.\u201d", "A Nosferatu forcefully raised Phi Sora\u2019s head.", "Undying Diligence shook the hand that was holding Seol Jihu.", "\u201cIs this that human?\u201d", "Phi Sora looked up with a pair of trembling eyes before opening her mouth with difficulty.", "\u201cSo\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cSo?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026So fucking ugly\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora sniggered as if she had gone mad. Undying Diligence snorted and slammed her with his elbow.", "Her neck turned over 90 degrees to the side, and her upper body lifelessly sagged down.", "\u201cIs this\u2014\u201d", "\u201cPtui!\u201d", "Chohong spat before Undying Diligence could even finish his question.", "When the bloody spit got on his uniform, Undying Diligence slammed her head down with his heel.", "Blood spurted out from Chohong\u2019s seven orifices.", "Undying Diligence calmly took out a handkerchief and wiped off the spit from his uniform.", "And when he found the Priest with her head kissing the ground, trembling with her hands cupped together, a conspicuous light flickered in his eyes.", "\u201cAnswer. You just have to give a confirmation.\u201d", "Undying Diligence spoke in a benevolent tone.", "\u201cIf you answer, I will let you live. This, I promise.\u201d", "Maria\u2019s trembling slowly subsided.", "The patiently waiting Undying Diligence suddenly blinked his eyes.", "Now that he took a closer look, he could see an altar beneath her feet. A cross-shaped artifact was slowly scattering away as ash.", "\u201cMor Te Oculorum Meorum!\u201d", "Maria shot her head up and shouted.", "\u201cMjolnir!\u201d", "As Undying Diligence had tilted his head down at the most opportune moment, a large hammer of light directly struck his face.", "\u201c\u2026Huuu.\u201d", "Undying Diligence sighed as he dusted off the crackling electricity on his face.", "\u201cKwuek\u2014!\u201d", "When his foot pierced Maria\u2019s solar plexus, she yelped and passed out like a frog.", "Undying Diligence retracted his foot. Seeing the stream of blood flowing through the rocks on the ground, he smacked his lips.", "\u201cShould I have kept the guy from before alive\u2026?\u201d", "In the end, he muttered, \u201cI guess there\u2019s no choice now.\u201d And just as he put more strength into his grip.", "\u201cShould I answer that question for you?\u201d", "A cheerful voice rang out.", "Undying Diligence\u2019s nose twitched. He saw a fistful of dust shining with silvery light, being scattered around him.", "\u2018This dust\u2026\u2019", "\u201cExplosion!\u201d", "In the next instant, the dust exploded with a brilliant light, swallowing Undying Diligence\u2019s face.", "\u201cHeup\u2014!\u201d", "When Undying Diligence subconsciously took in a breath, the fire quickly subsided. Next, he shook his head strongly, shrugged his shoulders, and turned his body.", "An old man with his white beard grown out long was standing there, aiming a staff at him.", "\u201cMagician\u2026 where did you get this dust?\u201d", "\u201cBy luck?\u201d", "Ian smiled. The Nosferatus quickly showed signs of movement, but Undying Diligence waved his hand to stop them.", "\u201cDo you have more of it?\u201d", "\u201cOf course not. Because you guys have been so thorough in destroying it, I didn\u2019t even get to see it! I could only acquire a tiny amount thanks to divine fortune. I\u2019m sure you know this better than anyone else, so why ask?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right. But to think you managed to obtain even a tiny amount\u2026 you\u2019re quite talented.\u201d", "\u201cThank you for the compliment. Anyways.\u201d", "Ian stroked his beard and furrowed his brows.", "\u201cHow strange. According to the Empire\u2019s historical records, Moon Light was one of the weapons developed to combat the Parasite Queen and her Army Commanders, being one of the few effective tools that\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThat is indeed true. Crushing a jewel containing rare mana, putting the pieces in a goblet containing holy water, and using the moonlight to balance the two energies \u2014 a fusion and condensation of mana and holy power. It was an excellent idea.\u201d", "\u201cYou say this, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have done much.\u201d", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was completely ineffective.\u201d", "When Undying Diligence blew his nose, a lump of blood came out.", "\u201cIt worked, though just a little bit.\u201d", "He wiped his face before staring at Ian.", "\u201cA Magician should know about the law of equivalent exchange.\u201d", "He was telling Ian to answer his question now that he answered his.", "However, Ian waved his hand.", "\u201cYou\u2019re doing the math wrong. That was something I already knew, and you answered on your own. Don\u2019t expect me to buy into your forced sales pitch.\u201d", "\u201cForced sales pitch, you say\u2026. Well, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d", "Undying Diligence walked forward. Ian chuckled and turned his staff over.", "\u201cSoram!\u201d", "The ground rumbled, and pillars of earth shot up.", "Undying Diligence stretched his foot out, and he moved in an instant, leaving behind an afterimage.", "\u201cSpiral!\u201d", "The surfaces of the pillars of earth distorted. Next, dozens of thorns shot out.", "However, Undying Diligence crushed through them with his body and stood directly in front of Ian.", "\u201cSince you put on an interesting show and displayed the audacity to talk to me, I will give you another chance. Answer.\u201d", "\u201cMy friend, isn\u2019t it common sense to ask a question if you want an answer?\u201d", "Undying Diligence\u2019s complexion darkened. He lifted Seol Jihu up and opened his mouth.", "\u201cThere are only two things you can say from now on. Yes, or no.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "Puk! An arm penetrated Ian\u2019s thin stomach. When Undying Diligence stirred up Ian\u2019s insides, Ian took in a deep breath.", "\u201cDo you feel like speaking now?\u201d", "Ian\u2019s face contorted painfully. But rather than answering, he hurriedly grabbed the enemy\u2019s arm with his aged hands.", "Seeing the old man struggle to escape, Undying Diligence raised an eyebrow. And at that moment, Ian shouted past his shoulders.", "\u201cNow! Receiver of the Divine Vestige!\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d", "Undying Diligence turned back in a startle. However, the scenery behind him was the same.

A glittering brilliance erupted with a sacred blaze, sticking to Undying Diligence\u2019s face.", "\u201cKeeeeuu!\u201d", "For the first time, Undying Diligence screamed. He wrapped his hands around his face and staggered back.", "Ian caught the falling Seol Jihu and quickly dragged him out of the range of the explosion.", "\u201cY-You old insect\u2026!\u201d", "Undying Diligence screamed in a pained rage, and the boiling flames were extinguished instantly.", "\u201cFine. I will just kill everyone!\u201d", "Putting Seol Jihu down, Ian prepared a gale-type spell to blow the enemy back.

After striking Ian\u2019s face five, six times, Undying Diligence kicked his stomach hard.", "Beaten severely, Ian fell on top of Seol Jihu without uttering a single cry.", "\u201cI will kill you both!\u201d", "A reddish-black mist of blood rose up behind Undying Diligence as if to reflect his soaring rage.
