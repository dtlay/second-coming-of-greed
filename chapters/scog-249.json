Eva\u2019s Night (4)", "content": ["Seol Jihu pulled out his spear, muttering quietly.", "\u201c\u2026So weak.\u201d", "Setting the twins aside, he didn\u2019t understand how the man managed to become a High Ranker. But he put the meaningless question aside for now and went to search the rooms on the floor.", "Although he checked every room thoroughly, he couldn\u2019t see the manager. He only found two Beastmen, lying still as though they were dead.", "Then again, considering the ruckus he caused, the manager not showing up until now could only mean one of the two things \u2014 either he was hiding or he had already escaped.", "At that moment, he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.", "Chohong, Hugo, and Maria appeared one after the other.", "None of them looked hurt. But Maria\u2019s cheeks were red as if she was extremely angry.", "Chohong raised her Thorn of Steel and shook it left and right.", "\u201cOh, did you get the boss?\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t find him.\u201d", "\u201cHe must be hiding. The clean up is more or less finished. The crazy singer is guarding the entrance.\u201d", "\u201cWhere\u2019s Mister Marcel Ghionea?\u201d", "\u201cSearching the building. He said he\u2019s gonna go check if anyone is hiding.\u201d", "Seol Jihu fell into thought before moving his steps. He had to go to that place anyway.", "He went back down to the first floor, found the path to the basement and walked down. Just as he expected\u2026", "\u201cYes, yes, a group of lunatics\u2026 The goods are fine. Of course, the important goods are also\u2026\u201d", "The manager he had seen earlier in the day was holding a communication crystal, talking. An adolescent Foxman was being squeezed in his arm.", "Did he feel Seol Jihu\u2019s gaze? The manager looked back before jumping in shock.", "\u201cN-No way! Where\u2019s Jirayu Matthew\u2026!?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu stomped forward, he dropped the communication crystal in a fluster.", "\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026!\u201d", "Finally recognizing Seol Jihu, Hugh Rodrigo staggered backward. His eyes then glinted, and he quickly choked the young Foxman with his arm.", "\u201cS-Stay back!\u201d", "Seeing the young Foxman stifled for breath, Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes flickered with light.", "\u201cYou must be here for the goods, right?\u201d", "Pang, pang, pang! Without a moment of hesitation, he activated the Festina Earring three times.", "\u201cYou think I\u2019ll hand them over so easily!? I\u2019d rather kill them all and \u2026!\u201d", "Whish! A fierce wind blew past, and Rodrigo squinted his eyes.", "An unknown pressure brushed past his chest for a moment, but he shook his head and continued.", "\u201cMake their values\u2026?\u201d", "With a dazed expression, he stopped in the middle of his sentence.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "He lowered his gaze and couldn\u2019t see the Foxman he had in his hand.", "Rodrigo stealthily rolled his eyes up. There, he saw Seol Jihu\u2019s back. Having passed Rodrigo before he even noticed, Seol Jihu was standing tall, gently hugging the young Foxman in his arms.", "Rodrigo was shocked. He hadn\u2019t even seen him move!", "Even the Foxman child was astonished, looking up at him with widened eyes.", "Rodrigo\u2019s mouth opened wide.", "\u201cChohong, Hugo.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke while carefully putting the Foxman down.", "\u201cMake sure he can\u2019t escape. You can break his teeth if he keeps spouting nonsense.\u201d", "\u201cRoger!\u201d", "Hugo shouted as he spun his arm in a circle.", "Seol Jihu looked back at the steel cages and raised the Spear of Purity. The sudden uproar had caught the enslaved foreign race\u2019s attention.", "Seol Jihu swung his spear at the nearest cage. Swish. As expected of a divine spear, it cut through steel like tofu.", "As the steel bars of the cage fell down, a huge hole was created above it. There, he could see a Foxman, her limbs chained to the now-severed bars.", "She must not have expected this sequence of events as she was clearly taken aback. Her faded ears were standing up stiffly, and her tail was wagging gently.", "Seol Jihu promptly cut the chains off, freeing her completely.", "The Foxman twisted her body, swaying greatly as if she couldn\u2019t get used to the long-found freedom.", "She held herself up by holding onto the wall and asked with a doubtful face.", "\u201c\u2026What are your motives, male human?\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke calmly.", "\u201cWe came to save you.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll send you back to the Federation. It may be hard, but please cooperate with us.\u201d", "Was a rescue outside of her expectation? A clear hint of suspicion spread on the Foxman\u2019s face.", "There was no time to waste on convincing her. Seol Jihu rummaged through his belt, took out a healing potion, and poured it into the Foxman\u2019s open mouth.", "\u201cUup!\u201d", "The Foxman\u2019s eyes widened. After barely being able to stand from suffering all kinds of torment, her body regained a little bit of vitality.", "Seol Jihu turned around. There were dozens of cages in the basement. He had to get to work.", "\u201cH-Hey! Just take one, you bastard!\u201d", "Rodrigo shouted in frustration.", "\u201cShut it!\u201d", "Chwak! But Maria slapped his cheek, yelling.", "\u201cYou\u2019re the manager here? You fucking piece of shit, you call this security? What the fuck is wrong with you!?\u201d", "\u201cW-What!?\u201d", "\u201cHow can even a single guard fail to get to my barrier? How the hell did you only get these shit-for-brains as guards? I have to give up a gold egg because of you!\u201d", "Maria slapped his cheek again and again, spitting out curses one after the other, while Rodrigo shed tears begrudgingly.", "Seol Jihu paid no attention to them and focused on liberating the foreign races. Finding a Sky Fairy shivering in the corner of her cage, he quickly cut the steel cage and removed the chains binding her.", "\u201cAre you okay?\u201d", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "The moment he approached her, the Sky Fairy dropped her head and raised her hands. Her mouth opened, but like a goldfish, no sound came out. She seemed to be suffering from mental trauma due to the terrifying experience she had.", "Looking at her carefully, one could see that she was in terrible shape. She must have been beaten severely as she seemed to be in the worst condition among the prisoners held captive in this basement.", "While Seol Jihu was at a loss for words, another Sky Fairy approached her and gently embraced the Sky Fairy who was groaning strangely.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. Everything\u2019s over, Lacia. We\u2019re saved. We can go back home.\u201d", "With a member of her own race comforting her, the Sky Fairy\u2019s trembling subsided slightly. The Sky Fairy who just walked up asked with a hoarse voice.", "\u201cCan I ask you to heal her?\u201d", "Seol Jihu snapped out of his daze and called for Maria. The Priest who was busy slapping Rodrigo\u2019s face endlessly, drew a deep breath and responded to the summon.", "Once she saw the Sky Fairy\u2019s condition, she clicked her tongue.", "\u201cHoly fuck\u2026 I don\u2019t think an ordinary spell is going to cut it. Damn fucking pervert, he surely did a number on her.\u201d", "\u201cPlease do what you can.\u201d", "\u201cSure, sure.\u201d", "She chanted a spell in a murmur.", "Seol Jihu went back to rescuing the prisoners. The liberated foreign races staggered out of their cages, surrounding the manager.", "Feeling an instinctive danger, Rodrigo struggled to escape but became silent after taking a dozen of Hugo\u2019s fists.", "By the time Seol Jihu finished liberating everyone, most of the foreign races were sending heated gazes at Seol Jihu.", "They weren\u2019t fools. Not only did he subdue the bastard who locked them up, but he also healed them as well. They knew that Seol Jihu was here to help.", "But there was one thing they dearly wanted.", "Having received their message full of strong desire, Seol Jihu took a step back. He leaned his head forward and reached out with his hand, gesturing, Do what you want.", "Killing intent soared, as dozens of gazes fell on one spot. The intensity made Hugo, who was holding Rodrigo\u2019s neck, flinch.", "\u201cHa\u2026 Just how badly did you treat them?\u201d", "Hugo shook his head and threw Rodrigo to the ground.", "The fat man rolled on the ground, and a dozen howls immediately burst out. The foreign races pounced on Rodrigo simultaneously.", "One, two, four, eight\u2026 Rodrigo was covered by the foreign races, who jumped forward from all directions. The Beastmen tore his hair out, dug out his eyes, and cut open his stomach to vent their anger. It was as if a group of zombies was devouring a live man.", "Seol Jihu, who was watching silently, suddenly felt someone approach him. It was the Sky Fairy who previously showed signs of trauma.", "She didn\u2019t participate in exacting vengeance, instead staggered toward Seol Jihu and softly grabbed the hem of his shirt.", "She knelt down, almost in a crumbling fashion, and looked up. Her eyes were still haunted by horror, but her expression was even more desperate. The Sky Fairy opened her mouth, mustering up great courage.", "\u201cC-Child\u2026\u201d", "\u2018Child?\u2019", "\u201cChild\u2026 my child\u2026 please\u2026 please\u2026\u201d", "She wept in a pitiful voice.", "\u2018Don\u2019t tell me.\u2019", "Seol Jihu suddenly remembered the adolescent Sky Fairy who appeared at the auction.", "\u201cIs your child\u2026 a young boy?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked just to be sure, and light returned to the depressed Sky Fairy\u2019s abyss-like eyes. She nodded her head, squeezing the hem of Seol Jihu\u2019s shirt tighter as if he was the Messiah.", "But with everyone participating in the auction wearing masks and robes, Seol Jihu had not seen the buyer and was at a loss for what to do. It was then.", "\u201cHere you were.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea opened the basement door and walked down the stairs, dragging a willowy man with his hand. It was the host who carried out the auction.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes flickered with light.", "\u201cHe was hiding. I interrogated him, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be the manager.\u201d", "\u201cGood job.\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied quickly and held the man up by his collar. He seemed to have been beaten up a few times already as he was bruised all over his face.", "\u201cAnswer properly if you want to live.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s cold tone even frightened himself. The man nodded his head crazily, his eyes wet with tears. Marcel Ghionea must have handled him well as he was quite cooperative.", "\u201cYou remember the Sky Fairy at the auction today, right? The young boy.\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes! I do!\u201d", "\u201cWho\u2019s the buyer? Do you know him?\u201d", "\u201cYes, I do!\u201d", "\u201cYou do?\u201d", "\u201cYes! I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s Sombat La-ongmanee!\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows. The man quickly continued.", "\u201cI\u2019m not lying! I\u2019ve been hosting the auction for a long time and we get many repeat customers! The product was that bastard\u2019s taste as well! I\u2019m positive!\u201d", "It didn\u2019t sound like he was lying. Seol Jihu threw the man backward, and a terrified shriek rang out.", "\u2018Sombat La-ongmanee? I\u2019ve never heard of him before\u2026.\u2019", "It wasn\u2019t as if he could go around looking for a random Earthling. Realizing that he needed to get some information on this guy, he reached into his pocket to take out the communication crystal. It was then\u2014", "\u201cSombat La-ongmanee, the leader of Royal Pattaya, one of Eva\u2019s eight organizations. Their main business is loan-sharking and gay trade, and he\u2019s known to enjoy homosexual relationships with young boys before killing them through torture.\u201d", "Suddenly, a familiar voice rang out behind him. Turning around, Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened. Kim Hannah was walking down the stairs with a coy look.", "\u201cRoyal Pattaya has a total of 76 members \u2014 11 Level 2s, 36 Level 3s, 28 Level 4s, and 1 Level 5. The average level is 3.25. Two Priests, no Magicians. Their ace is the High Ranker Warrior, Jirayu Matthew.\u201d", "Reciting information about Royal Pattaya, she walked up to Seol Jihu. After looking around the basement, she let out a small sigh. Then, she asked in a determined manner.", "\u201cYou\u2019re going, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked in surprise before nodding. Kim Hannah bit her lower lip and took out a small notebook from her pocket. She scribbled something on the paper before ripping it out and handing it over. It was a map to Royal Pattaya.", "Seol Jihu took the map with a renewed look. He remembered Kim Hannah being against it previously, but now her attitude had changed.", "Of course, there was a reason Kim Hannah\u2019s attitude took a complete 180-degree turn. She thought wrong from the very beginning. She planned to guide Seol Jihu in a specific direction, but he strayed off completely.", "Mainly, Seol Jihu was someone who could not be controlled.", "As such, she had no choice but to go another way. Kim Hannah had to match herself to Seol Jihu.", "The matter had already been blown out of proportion and was impossible to reverse. The worst move she could make now would be to end things halfway.", "It might have been better to not do anything, but now that they started this mess, they had to see it to the end. Not only was it the correct thing to do, but it was also the only thing they could do.", "\u201cEva\u2019s organizations have a 1 Strong, 3 Middle, 4 Weak structure. Royal Pattaya is a Middle-level organization.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s calm voice\u2026", "\u201cGo. You can leave this place to me.\u201d", "\u2026suddenly turned sharp.", "\u201cYou need to crush at least one organization until the sun comes up. Make them have no hope of revitalization. Only then can we worry about our next move.\u201d", "\u201cRoyal Pattaya, huh.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea put on a worried look.", "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound easy. The auction house is one thing, but directly striking the organization\u2019s headquarters should be a lot more difficult.\u201d", "\u201cNo, it should be more than doable.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s ponytail fluttered in the air.", "\u201cNot all organizations started out in Eva from the beginning.\u201d", "That was obvious.", "\u201cThey raised their forces and fought each other over benefits before being recognized as organizations. Royal Pattaya was one of them.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s possible?\u201d", "\u201cBack then, forming an organization wasn\u2019t as hard. The kingdoms encouraged it, in fact. The standard only went up after that incident happened in Eva.\u201d", "[To be honest, I\u2019m still a little confused. I don\u2019t know why they made the procedure so complicated.]", "[Well, it wasn\u2019t like this in the past\u2026.]", "\u2018Ah.\u2019", "Seol Jihu finally realized why Kim Hannah was so confident and why Hao Win wanted to come to Eva.", "Most likely, a majority of Eva\u2019s eight organizations had not followed the proper procedures like Carpe Diem, pulling underhanded schemes to reach the status of organizations.", "\u201cBy my standards, among Eva\u2019s current organizations, only two, or three if I\u2019m being generous, are enough to be recognized as organizations in Scheherazade or Haramark.\u201d", "The eight organizations would be scary if they worked together, but dealing with them wasn\u2019t impossible if one could handle them individually.", "Chohong nodded her head in agreement.", "\u201cYeah, the guys here are all shrimps. If they\u2019re forced to participate in a war, they would die before they could do anything.\u201d", "\u201cNo. I bet not a single one of them will die.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cBecause they\u2019ll run away without fighting.\u201d", "Chohong sniggered at Kim Hannah\u2019s ridicule.

The leader, whom she thought would walk the path of royalty, had instead chosen to walk the path of a conqueror.", "That wasn\u2019t bad either.", "After carefully reflecting on the matter, she decided that Seol Jihu could easily walk this path. After all, Carpe Diem still had a secret weapon that had not been revealed to the world.", "Unless the enemy brought in a Unique Ranker Priest, it was far more likely for Carpe Diem to be triumphant.", "\u201cSlaughter them thoroughly. I better not see any half-assed show of mercy.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed quietly. Crumpling the paper map in his hand, he began walking\u2026", "\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "\u2026To his next destination, Royal Pattaya."]}
