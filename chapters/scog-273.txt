Is it really true?\u201d", "Her manner of speech suddenly changed. Her tone also went up.

Anyway, Jung Sua has been wanting to meet you. How about it? Would you like to try talking with her before lunch?\u201d", "\u2018Iya\u2026\u2019", "Kim Hannah was impressed. Even after summoning them all the way here, this so-called queen was telling them to resolve the issue with Jung Sua on their own?", "This wasn\u2019t something a queen should say. However, Kim Hannah figured out what happened. She had expected as much when she saw Jung Sua here.", "Jung Sua must have felt pressured when the queen\u2019s cognition of Valhalla began to change. She must have joined this meeting forcefully to deal with the anxiousness in her heart.", "Her intention was clear just from her previous action. Suddenly barging into the queen\u2019s conversation with Seol Jihu and trying to set up a private meeting with Kim Hannah, both of these must have been a show to say, \u2018Look. This is my position. This is how much the queen thinks about me.\u2019", "\u2018I guess it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019", "In fact, Kim Hannah wanted to welcome it with her arms spread out. She originally planned to set up a private meeting by borrowing Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s authority. But the criminal must be suffering from a guilty conscience as she was putting herself back into the crime scene.", "Since she wanted to enter the fox\u2019s mouth so much, it would only be right to thoroughly devour her.", "Kim Hannah\u2019s smile thickened.", "\u201cI see no reason to refuse. I wanted to talk with Representative Jung as well.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria\u2019s expression brightened. Although she talked big and told Jung Sua not to worry, she was not used to interfering in such matters. She was troubled on how to lead the conversation, so how could she not be happy knowing that this issue was resolving itself?", "\u201cGreat. I will be talking with Representative Seol, then.\u201d", "\u201cThank you for listening to my request, Your Majesty.\u201d", "\u201cAre you that happy? I can see you\u2019re full of smiles.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I am very happy.\u201d", "Jung Sua walked forward with a beaming smile. After giving Seol Jihu a mysterious smile, she passed him and stopped in front of Kim Hannah.", "\u201cThank you for accepting the offer. I was scared you might reject it.\u201d", "\u201cHow could I when you said you\u2019ve been wanting to meet me for a long time? Plus, I have also been meaning to talk to you.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria made a joyful expression, seemingly happy that the two women were getting along.", "\u201cDon\u2019t talk for too long. Come to the dining hall before the food goes cold.\u201d", "\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d", "The two women said courteously.", "\u201cFollow me. I know a quiet place.\u201d", "\u201cPerfect. A quiet place was exactly what I was hoping for as well.\u201d", "Seol Jihu swallowed hard.", "\u2018They\u2019re both smiling\u2026 but both of their eyes are unmoving.\u2019", "Was this what it felt like to witness the calm before the storm? Seol Jihu felt cold sweat flow down his back.", "Just like that, the two women bearing knives in their stomachs left laughing. Once the two disappeared, an awkward silence filled the grand hall.", "\u201cUh\u2026 what did you say your name was?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s Seol Jihu.\u201d", "\u201cRight, Seol Jihu. And your organization name\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s Valhalla.\u201d", "A meaningless conversation went back and forth. Now that only the two of them were left, Charlotte Aria looked lost. She was very clearly trying her best to find something to talk about.", "\u2018No.\u2019", "To be more precise, she probably did not want to talk about a topic that would make things awkward. She must be racking her brains right now to talk only about things that both sides wanted to hear and ultimately end the meeting comfortably.", "But Seol Jihu could not let that happen. Since Kim Hannah had walked up to the stage first, it was now his turn to go up.", "But before that, he had to create the stage first.", "\u201cThank you for inviting me today.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke after organizing his thoughts.", "\u201cI should have come to see you first to submit the report on the royal mission\u2019s completion.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria turned cheerful. The awkward silence was killing her, but a good topic to waste time on had presented itself.", "\u201cNow that you mention it, I heard you successfully escorted the Federation\u2019s members back home.\u201d", "\u201cIt was nothing difficult. I\u2019d like to apologize for reporting so late.\u201d", "\u201cNo, no, it happens. You don\u2019t need to apologize.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria waved it off like it was nothing important.", "\u201cWere you busy with something?\u201d", "She took the bait earlier than he expected.", "\u201cRather than busy, something unexpected happened.\u201d", "\u201cHmm? Something unexpected?\u201d", "\u201cYes, while I was away, the Eva Alliance carried out an attack.\u201d", "Seol Jihu did not give her the chance to speak.", "\u201cThankfully, we were able to resolve the trouble with the Triads\u2019 support\u2026\u201d", "Short and sweet, that was the name of the game.", "\u201cFrom what I know, the Earthling who incited the Alliance to attack has not yet received any punishment.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cN-No.\u201d", "\u201cYour Majesty, why are you protecting Jung Sua?\u201d", "Directly hit all of a sudden, Charlotte Aria\u2019s expression quickly stiffened. Not knowing where to look, she barely managed to squeak out.", "\u201cT-That is a misunderstanding.\u201d", "\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d", "Seol Jihu denied it firmly.", "\u201cY-You\u2019re wrong. It is a misunderstanding\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWhat part of it are you saying is a misunderstanding?\u201d", "\u201cJung Sua said\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThose are the words of the perpetrator. There are no evidence or even witnesses to back up her claim. She is only using her close relationship with Your Majesty to claim innocence.\u201d", "Though not loud, Seol Jihu spoke with clarity.", "\u201cOn the other hand, the evidence we provided all point to Jung Sua being an accomplice. Given this, I am failing to understand why you are trying to cover up for Representative Jung.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria shut her mouth. She stared at Seol Jihu at a loss for what to do. She seemed to be mumbling something in a barely audible voice, but Seol Jihu could not make out any words.", "Seol Jihu closed his eyes. The Status Window did not lie.", "This queen, Charlotte Aria, was weak. Almost too weak.", "Since that was the case, Seol Jihu was left with only one option \u2014 to force her to see and hear the truth, even if that truth left her with great shock.", "\u201cQueen.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cRepresentative Jung is a liar.\u201d", "\u201cJung Sua is\u2026!\u201d", "Charlotte Aria was about to shout something but shut her mouth in the next moment. She chewed on her fair lips in a flurry.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes flickered with light. In truth, he expected Charlotte Aria to get furious the moment he denounced Jung Sua. He fully expected to get on her wrong side or be kicked out of the palace, but her reaction was rather stale.", "Should he consider himself lucky?", "\u2018Maybe\u2026.\u2019", "Perhaps Charlotte Aria knew deep inside that Jung Sua was using her. In that case, she must be keeping her around because Jung Sua was the only one understanding her and accepting her tantrums.", "Of course, this was only a conjecture.", "Seol Jihu sighed. He didn\u2019t plan to talk for long. If words would have any effect, Sorg K\u00fchne would have gotten the job done a long time ago.", "Things had come to this point because she could not be persuaded with words. By now, Kim Hannah must be carrying out her plan as well.", "Seol Jihu walked forward without asking for permission. Charlotte Aria shrunk back into the throne, almost as if she was burying herself in the seat.", "\u201cD-Don\u2019t come closer. Y-You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d", "She must really be scared as her tiny shoulders trembled faintly. Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I am here to help you, queen.\u201d", "\u201cHelp me?\u201d", "\u201cTo tell you the truth, an acquaintance has asked me to come. To help Your Majesty open your eyes.\u201d", "\u201cAn acquaintance asked you to come?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria frowned as she repeated what Seol Jihu said like a parrot.", "\u201cJust who\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me, you are talking about Teresa Unni?\u201d", "Seol Jihu did not answer. He stopped in front of the throne, casting a shadow over it.", "\u201cYour Majesty might not know, but Representative Jung has tricked you thoroughly. From the beginning to the end.\u201d", "\u201cI-It isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d", "\u201cYour Majesty must not know. No, even if you did, you would not want to believe it.\u201d", "Once Seol Jihu perfectly pointed out her inner feelings, Charlotte Aria\u2019s expression became even more anxious. Tears began to well up around her eyes as she looked up.", "\u201cSo I will show you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled faintly.", "\u201cWhether Representative Jung is lying through her teeth or not, please decide after seeing and hearing it for yourself.\u201d", "*", "Meanwhile, the air flowing between Kim Hannah and Jung Sua could not be any colder.", "Jung Sua was glaring at Kim Hannah in dismay. She had entered this private meeting, fully prepared to yield as many benefits as possible.", "Although the Eva Royal Palace was Jung Sua\u2019s home ground, given the opponent she was dealing with, she was prepared to tolerate her overbearing attitude.", "But setting aside Kim Hannah\u2019s attitude and bearing, Jung Sua was struck speechless by Kim Hannah directly refusing to negotiate on anything.", "\u201cI don\u2019t like repeating myself.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke as she rubbed her thumb over the fingernail of her index finger. Her expression could not be more apathetic.", "\u201cJust hurry up and choose.\u201d", "Jung Sua smirked.", "\u201cYou sure are greedy.\u201d", "\u201cI know I\u2019m a fat lump of greed, so you don\u2019t have to say it. Now, I will say it just one more time.\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me.\u201d", "\u201cDo you want to quietly leave with what you have now? Or do you want to be dragged out in tears and snot after suffering all sorts of nasty things?\u201d", "Jung Sua clenched her teeth. She squeezed her interlocked hands and feigned a smile.", "\u201cI\u2019ve heard your name many times, so I\u2019m surprised that a woman known as the Fox cannot distinguish between heaven and earth.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t distinguish between heaven and earth?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. What if I say no to both?\u201d", "Jung Sua tilted her chin up.", "\u201cThen what are you going to do?\u201d", "Kim Hannah raised an eyebrow. Jung Sua asked again.", "\u201cLet me be blunt. What can you even do?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re more cheeky than I anticipated.\u201d", "\u201cMiss Kim Hannah.\u201d", "Jung Sua continued softly.", "\u201cIt looks like you are gravely mistaken here. This is not Scheherazade, and Valhalla is not Sinyoung.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would be this terrible at grasping the situation. I was wondering why you were kicked out of Sinyoung. Now I\u2019m starting to understand.\u201d", "\u201cKik.\u201d", "Kim Hannah dropped her head. Her body trembled as she continued to snort.", "Jung Sua spoke blandly.", "\u201cDo you need to put on airs like that? Do you think such a boorish act will make me bat an eye?\u201d", "\u201cPut on airs?\u201d", "Kim Hannah raised her head with great difficulty and said while snickering.", "\u201cMiss Jung Sua, let me tell you something.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. I don\u2019t really want to know.\u201d", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re provoking someone, you need to know who you are up against. I can\u2019t count the number of people who acted so arrogantly in front of me without knowing their place and ended up going through hell.\u201d", "\u201cAh~ I see. Well, that was very enlightening. It\u2019s much more original than just saying, \u2018Do you know who I am?\u2019\u201d", "Jung Sua struck back without the slightest change in her expression.", "\u201cRight, you need to act brave when you can.\u201d", "Kim Hannah nodded.", "\u201cThey\u2019ll say this and that, acting without a fear in the world.

Well, it\u2019s quite a sight.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to listen to your poor hobbies.\u201d", "Jung Sua scoffed.", "Chuckling, Kim Hannah rubbed the transparent crystal earring on her left ear and reached out with the other hand. She took out a thick stack of paper from her handbag.", "\u201cWhat do you think this is?\u201d", "She asked while gently waving the stack of paper in the air. Jung Sua did not reply. She only stared at Kim Hannah with a leisurely face.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a report about you. Everything about Miss Jung Sua is written here, starting from your birth to how you ended up in your current position.\u201d", "Jung Sua frowned slightly.", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "Kim Hannah handed the stack of paper over to Jung Sua and continued.", "\u201cBorn in 1994 in the Year of the Dog at Dongjin Hospital in Gunsan. You have two older siblings\u2014 one male and one female. You attended Sundo Elementary School until second grade and then moved to Seoul, transferring to Samsil Elementary School. Next\u2026\u201d", "As Kim Hannah continued to read about her life, the creases on Jung Sua\u2019s forehead became clearer.", "\u201cYou investigated my background?\u201d", "\u201cAh, just to be clear, I didn\u2019t do it. I never asked for it either.\u201d", "\u201cHow the hell does that make any sense? How else would\u2014\u201d", "\u201cOh, trust me, it makes sense. Sinyoung gifted it to us at our opening ceremony.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled sweetly.", "\u201cSinyoung?\u201d", "\u201cFor someone who\u2019s quick to grab opportunities, you\u2019re quite stupid. I was going to correct you before, but what makes you think I was kicked out of Sinyoung?\u201d", "Kim Hannah clicked her tongue as if she pitied Jung Sua.", "\u201cSeol Jihu invited me while I was with Sinyoung, and after coming to Eva, he created an organization with unprecedented speed. Doesn\u2019t this ring a bell?\u201d", "Kim Hannah flicked the stack of paper.", "\u201cAnd this report, it came from Sinyoung\u2019s Director Yun. She even delivered it personally.\u201d", "Jung Sua flinched.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you heard that she visited us for the opening ceremony. With how busy she is, do you think she really came all the way to Eva just to bother a former employee?\u201d", "The smile on Jung Sua\u2019s face finally began to wilt.", "\u201cLike jeez, I\u2019ve never heard anything so absurd. I mean, I get that you\u2019re high-spirited with the queen\u2019s trust, and it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s difficult to touch you or Evangeline. But that\u2019s not the only available method.\u201d", "Kim Hannah flipped a few pages.", "\u201cHere it is. Your father\u2019s name is Jung Hwansung.

Your father, mother, oppa, unni\u2014 all of them, of course.\u201d", "Jung Sua was no longer listening.", "Drrrk! She shot up while dragging the chair roughly. After panting in anger for a long time, Jung Sua spat out furiously.", "\u201cYou made a mistake.\u201d", "\u201cMistake? We are far stronger on Earth. What are you going to do about it?\u201d", "Kim Hannah returned the exact same words Jung Sua said to her. Jung Sua\u2019s mouth twisted.", "\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? This is not Scheherazade. This is Eva\u2019s royal palace.\u201d", "\u201cI know where I am. I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d", "Kim Hannah rested her chin on the back of her interlocked hands and shrugged.", "Jung Sua\u2019s expression distorted.", "\u201cDo you think I will surrender to such an underhanded threat?\u201d", "\u201cIt worked wonderfully before. Everyone who talked like you, they all gave up in the end.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Oh yeah?\u201d", "Jung Sua turned around as if there was no point in speaking more.", "\u201cYou messed with the wrong person.\u201d", "\u201cHuaaaam.\u201d", "Kim Hannah tapped her mouth and yawned in a big motion. Jung Sua glared at her with sharp killing intent before stomping away.", "As she made her way to the grand hall, tears suddenly burst out. The massive humiliation she suffered stimulated her entire body and forced her to cry.", "Jung Sua headed to the grand hall while crying quietly.", "\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d", "As soon as she saw the queen in the distance, she ran forward and grabbed Charlotte Aria. Crying her heart out, she confessed everything Kim Hannah said just now.", "\u201cSo you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d", "Charlotte Aria spoke in a trembling voice.", "\u201cKim Hannah threatened you?\u201d", "\u201cYes!\u201d", "Seeing that the queen was furious, Jung Sua nodded her head as if she had been waiting for this moment.", "\u201cShe told me to leave quietly! Otherwise, she would mess with my family!\u201d", "\u201cFamily?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria cut her off and asked back.", "\u201cBy family, you mean your one and only younger sister?\u201d", "\u201cYe\u2026 Yes!\u201d", "As she agreed in the heat of the moment, Jung Sua felt that something was out of place.", "The queen\u2019s attitude was somewhat different than usual. Rather than throwing a fuss and asking what this was about, she was extremely calm.", "Moreover, her eyes seemed to be tinged with great sorrow as she stared back at her.", "\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good to hear.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d", "\u201cYou said your parents passed away when you were young and the fight over the inheritance made you fall out with all of your relatives.\u201d", "Jung Sua blinked rapidly.", "\u201cSince you don\u2019t have an older brother or an older sister, you can just focus on looking after your younger sibling. With your ability, taking care of one person should be easy.\u201d", "What was this? Why was she suddenly like this?", "The answer was revealed soon. Seol Jihu, who was standing next to Charlotte Aria, raised his arm. In his right hand was a faintly flashing crystal.", "\u2018A communication crystal?\u2019", "Looking at it closely, it was reflecting a familiar scenery.", "The moment Jung Sua realized it was the room she just stormed out of, shock spread out inside her pupils.", "Shortly afterward, the scenery inside the crystal slowly changed. As the crystal showed Kim Hannah waving her hand with a kind smile\u2014", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "Jung Sua\u2019s eyes split open, and her mind went blank."]}
