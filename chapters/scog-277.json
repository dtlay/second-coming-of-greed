Although the question he was afraid of was asked sooner than expected, Seol Jihu calmly responded with a straight face.", "\u201cIs it a name I shouldn\u2019t know about?\u201d", "\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that, but\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah tilted her head without finishing her sentence.", "With her reaction, Seol Jihu came up with a new hypothesis\u2014 that Eun Yuri might not be famous in Paradise.", "If she was renowned and everyone knew her, \u2018of course you\u2019ve heard the name,\u2019 would have been the adequate reaction. After all, Seol Jihu was now an Earthling who\u2019d spent some time in Paradise.", "But Kim Hannah\u2019s current reaction was closer to, \u2018how do you know her?\u2019", "Meaning, Eun Yuri must be an Earthling that only a few people knew of.", "\u201cCan you tell me anything that you know about her? This is quite important for me, personally.\u201d", "Kim Hannah seemed to think that this was out of the blue.", "\u2018What for?\u2019", "It was rare for this idiot to take on a serious matter apart from battles and training.", "\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019", "On the other hand, her reaction carried a hint of high hope as Seol Jihu tended to surprise her when he was serious once in a while. Well, except for when he was coming up with names.", "\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal telling you. But may I hear the reason first?\u201d", "Although she asked out of curiosity\u2026", "\u201cI can\u2019t say anything right now. I can only be certain once I learn more.\u201d", "Seol Jihu flatly refused to answer. But because it didn\u2019t feel right to hide everything, he told his intentions.", "\u201cAlthough I will decide after I investigate more, I am considering recruiting her.\u201d", "\u201cAh, recruitment.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke, nodding her head.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you know her, but\u2026that might be pretty hard.\u201d", "\u201cHow so?\u201d", "\u201cAs far as I know, the person named Eun Yuri\u2026\u201d", "And what followed\u2026", "\u201cIs already dead. In Paradise, of course.\u201d", "\u2026was simply shocking.", "Seol Jihu momentarily became speechless and could only blink his eyes.", "He thought it would either be that she was active in Paradise or had yet to enter. He never expected to hear that she had died.", "He did not even consider it as a possibility since he heard that she was alive until the final war.", "Of course, it could be that his actions changed the future. Otherwise\u2026", "\u2018Does that mean she resurrected or something?\u2019", "Seol Jihu frowned and roughly swept his forehead.", "\u201cJust to make it clear, allow me to say something.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s voice echoed through the silent conference room.", "\u201cEun Yuri died in the Neutral Zone. She died without completing the three-month course.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cIs that why you say it would be hard for us to recruit her?\u201d", "\u201cI meant that it would be challenging, not impossible. Um\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah paused briefly before asking suddenly.", "\u201cHow much do you know about the Tutorial and the Neutral Zone?\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared blankly at Kim Hannah. She must have thought that further explanation was necessary as she slowly started to explain.", "For an Earthling to enter Paradise and become active, they had to go through two steps.First, an Earthling who accepted an invitation would be assigned a coordinate by the gold, silver, bronze, or red stamp. Once they were chosen as a subject for summoning, they would automatically move to the first testing ground when the time was right.", "Only after passing the three stages there, would they be authorized to move to the Neutral Zone.", "\u201cRepresentative Seol, do you remember how you went from the Tutorial to the Neutral Zone?\u201d", "\u201cI entered a portal.\u201d", "\u201cThen how about when you left the Neutral Zone? Tell me what the first thing you saw was.\u201d", "\u201cObviously it was the scenery of Paradise\u2026 Ah.\u201d", "It was then that Seol Jihu began to realize what Kim Hannah was trying to say.", "\u201cThe important thing is the portal. Although they are both testing grounds, the Tutorial is held on Earth while the Neutral Zone is a building located in Paradise. This is the biggest difference between the two.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled and continued.", "\u201cOf course, the results are the same no matter where you die. The only difference is the degree of dissociation you would feel afterward. You would lose all your memories of Paradise and resurrect on Earth.\u201d", "\u201cBut there is a difference if you resurrect in Paradise, right?\u201d", "\u201cExactly. If you die during the Tutorial, there is no limit on re-entering. Since it's before entering Paradise, it is considered that you died on Earth.\u201d", "Kim Hannah refined her voice.", "\u201cOn the other hand, if you die in the Neutral Zone, it is considered the same as an Earthling\u2019s death. Each Earthling is given only one chance to resurrect, and even that requires the use of a Divine Wish and going through the process of inviting the resurrected from Earth once more.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just similar, but identical.\u201d", "\u201cNo, there\u2019s one, just one difference.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s voice stressed importance on \u2018one.\u2019", "\u201cFor example, let\u2019s say all the tests just ended. If you die from a sudden accident after the door opens, you will resurrect outside of the Neutral Zone, regardless of whether you were still in the Neutral Zone building or not.\u201d", "Meaning, one would be considered an Earthling as soon as the Neutral Zone ended.", "\u201cBut it\u2019s a different story if you die in the Neutral Zone before its completion. In this case, you start over from the Tutorial when you resurrect.\u201d", "\u201cNot from the Neutral Zone?\u201d", "\u201cNo. Although you technically entered Paradise, your Neutral Zone curriculum is considered incomplete. Apparently, it\u2019s a decision made considering the fact that it takes at least 6 months in Earth\u2019s time to re-enter.\u201d", "\u201cWho decided that?\u201d", "\u201cThe seven gods.\u201d", "Seol Jihu became lost for words.", "\u201c\u2026Why is it so complicated\u2026\u201d", "He let out a sigh, feeling as if his hands were tied.", "Eun Yuri had died in the Neutral Zone. Therefore, to bring her to Paradise, they would need to go through a resurrection ceremony.", "\u2018Eun isn\u2019t a common family name, so it\u2019s unlikely that it would be someone with the same name.\u2019", "Now that he thought about it, the situation seemed strange.", "As far as Seol Jihu was aware, the Neutral Zone was considered an independent and separate area from Paradise despite its location. Meaning, there was no need to apply the rule of Paradise in it.", "Although there might be an issue with the law of causality or whatnot, he didn\u2019t think the seven gods lacked the strength to do anything about it. They must have more than enough strength to do so.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a bit harsh.\u201d", "Seol Jihu grumbled softly, breaking his deep thoughts.", "\u201cI get the point of testing Earthlings, but what\u2019s wrong with giving them a second chance?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWhy can\u2019t they just set the respawn point to where the person died? What\u2019s the point of only limiting the Neutral Zone?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s because the Neutral Zone reveals the Invited\u2019s value.\u201d", "Kim Hannah answered with a low voice.", "\u201cAlthough the scouts have their own standards, an Invited\u2019s potential is unknown until their awakening. Only after passing the Awakening Chamber and acquiring a class would their true worth be revealed.\u201d", "Kim Hannah suddenly kept silent for a while, hesitating to let out what was on the tip of her tongue.", "Seol Jihu frowned as he waited for her to continue.", "\u201cNo way.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not, right? It can\u2019t be that this restriction was also made because of Earthlings. Eii, no way.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026It\u2019s true.\u201d", "Kim Hannah quietly admitted.", "Seol Jihu had a blank expression on his face.", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cThe Neutral Zone is an isolated area. Originally, no one except for the administrators managing the place knew what happened inside.\u201d", "\u201cBut that\u2019s not true. You\u2019ve seen what happened.\u201d", "\u201cHence the term, \u2018originally\u2019. It wasn\u2019t like that before. A lot happened in Paradise before you entered, like killing an enemy organization\u2019s Invited while disguising it as an accident or disturbing them so they can\u2019t gather points. Tampering was especially common.\u201d", "\u201cTampering? They ignored the primary negotiating rights?\u201d", "\u201cYes. The general manager or an instructor would secretly approach them and suggest it.\u201d", "\u201cAnd there were people taking the offer?\u201d", "\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t there be? As long as you coax them well, the Contracted are almost always guaranteed to fall. \u2018You\u2019re a Red Mark, aren\u2019t you? Do you want to live as a slave? It would be a shame if someone as talented as you ended up in that organization. Hey, I\u2019ll mark you again as bronze or silver. We can start again from the Tutorial. We\u2019ll support you all the way! You\u2019ve done it once already. Twice wouldn\u2019t be hard.\u2019 Something like this.\u201d", "Kim Hannah shrugged.", "\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work out, they could assassinate them while they were asleep and bring them back after finding them on Earth. It would have been a problem if they did this out in public, but back then, there was no way of knowing.\u201d", "Seol Jihu let out a feigned laugh and shot a glance at Kim Hannah. The way she explained everything so fluidly, she must have done this several times as well.", "\u201c\u2026Be honest with me. You\u2019ve done it as well, haven\u2019t you?\u201d", "Kim Hannah did not answer. She only looked away and pretended not to hear his words. Soon, she cleared her throat and continued.", "\u201cAnyways, after one huge scandal, the seven kingdoms stopped remaining as mere spectators. They announced it to every organization in Paradise right away.\u201d", "\u201cAnnounced what?\u201d", "\u201cAlthough it was nothing more than words, they warned that they would not stand by idly if it happened again. Then, they limited the activities of managers and instructors in the Neutral Zone with the help of the seven gods.\u201d", "They could not harm pre-completion trainees without a valid reason, and just like how mentioning any matter regarding Paradise on Earth was prohibited, they were banned from saying anything that might be considered tampering.", "They placed communication crystals everywhere so they could observe the situation inside the Neutral Zone from the outside, and they made it so that a single organization could not monopolize the Neutral Zone admins.", "The death restriction in the Neutral Zone was created because of this as well.", "Even if they were able to slide their way through and succeed in tampering with the trainees, they would have to use immense contribution points to get what they wanted.", "\u201cThe seven kingdoms got away with that? Were there no objections?\u201d", "\u201cIt was quite clear who was at fault. Also, small and mid-scale organizations all supported the royal families\u2019 decisions.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve been thinking about this since a while back, but Earthlings really do know how to kill the goose that lays golden eggs.\u201d", "Seol Jihu, finally speaking up, shook his head. What he was hearing made him sick, so much so that Charlotte Aria, who was the epitome of frustration, seemed like an angel in comparison.", "\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d", "In any case, it was better to focus on the current matter at hand than to stay frustrated.", "\u201cI have a question though. Did the seven gods reinforce the restrictions before or after Eun Yuri\u2019s invitation?\u201d", "\u201cIt was after.\u201d", "\u201cThen there is a chance that Eun Yuri\u2019s death wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d", "\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t say for certain since I wasn\u2019t there, I do think that it is possible. Eun Yuri died the day the Awakening Chamber opened.\u201d", "\u201cThe very same day\u2026 That\u2019s fishy, alright.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tapped on the table with his fingers.", "\u201cHaven\u2019t you considered re-inviting her? Setting all the controversy aside.\u201d", "\u201cActually, it is a topic we\u2019ve discussed at Sinyoung. That\u2019s how I learned about her.\u201d", "Kim Hannah faithfully answered.", "\u201cThe problem was that the seven gods interfered before the next Neutral Zone opened. It was too much of a risk to scrape together so many contribution points to make a wish when her class wasn\u2019t clear. I believe it was the right decision for the company.\u201d", "\u201cThe right decision, huh.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "Eun Yuri was invited to Paradise and died in the Neutral Zone. This was an undeniable fact.", "The future could be altered, but there was no way to change the past.", "In that case, what choice should Seol Jihu make here?", "Should he erase the period on the writing and add in a comma, or should he stop reading?", "After thinking in depth, Seol Jihu decided to investigate a bit more. For some reason, it felt bad to close the book known as Eun Yuri like this.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything else, right?\u201d", "\u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d", "Kim Hannah caught the dissatisfaction on Seol Jihu\u2019s face and asked.\u201cAre you looking for more detailed information?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Can you get your hands on it?\u201d", "\u201cI could if you want me to, but\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah did not finish her sentence.", "Indeed, there were more than just one or two tasks she was currently in charge of. Moreover, it was too harsh even for Seol Jihu to ask her to investigate without a proper intelligence team.", "But in reality, Kim Hannah did not need to take on this task personally. There was a better way to go about it.", "Now that Seol Jihu thought of something they could work on meaningfully, he spoke with a smile.", "\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll deal with this on my own. It pairs well with the other work I\u2019ll be doing.\u201d", "\u201cOther work?\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes widened.", "*", "Time flew swiftly.", "Seol Jihu had been very busy recently, so much so that he did not realize that a new year had begun in Earth\u2019s time.", "Although staying in the office every day was stressful, Seol Jihu remained patient. Now was a very important time for Valhalla.", "Since he knew that it would be more convenient if he took concrete steps now, he carefully carried out internal restructuring.", "\u2018Systematic change, huh.\u2019", "Although Kim Hannah suggested they implement a military structure, Seol Jihu decided to add one more thing.", "It was the Youth System that was used in foreign soccer teams.", "Inspired by the fact that they could not leave the buildings in Haramark unused, he planned to use the old office as a facility to train newbies, Paradise\u2019s experienced veterans being excluded, of course.", "Once these newbies showed growth in their performance, they would be called to Eva as an official member. Conversely, if a regular\u2019s performance was lacking, they would be excluded from the front line and be sent to Haramark.", "Although the plan required a lot of effort, it was easily handled thanks to one person in Valhalla.", "Seol Jihu personally requested Paradise\u2019s greatest trainer, and Jang Maldong gladly accepted the offer. Seol Jihu was worried that it would be too much work, but Jang Maldong almost seemed happy to take it.", "Although passing the training responsibility to Jang Maldong took some weight off his shoulders, there were other things to worry about.", "Before they could dive into the structural reform, Seol Jihu held a meeting to announce what he had discussed with Kim Hannah.", "Since it was a matter everyone already expected from before the organization formed, there wasn\u2019t any great aversion to the idea. However, the problem was their reactions.", "When Seol Jihu asked, \u2018Does anyone want to take over the new attack team?\u2019 No one stepped forward.", "Seol Jihu was caught off guard since he was planning to keep one team under his supervision at the headquarters and create new smaller teams like military units.", "He was expecting either Hugo or Chohong to volunteer, but they did not seem interested at all. Seol Jihu called them separately and tried to persuade them, but Chohong\u2019s answer left him speechless.", "\u201cThink about it. You\u2019ll have your own team.\u201d", "\u201cUgh, just thinking about it stresses me out.\u201d", "\u201cIt would give you the authorities as a team leader.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not interested in authorities.\u201d", "\u201cI want you, Chohong, to take charge.\u201d", "\u201cWhy me!? I\u2019m too dumb to deal with stuff like this. Just ask Hugo!\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s constant bugging made Chohong lose her temper. She crossed her arms in a serious manner and spoke with a face full of betrayal.", "\u201cHey, this is no good. How can you do this to me?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cWho was the one who took care of you the most when you entered Paradise? It was me.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cAfter all this time we\u2019ve spent together, you\u2019re trying to abandon me? This is really disappointing!\u201d", "\u201cWho\u2019s abandoning whom?\u201d", "\u201cAnyway, I will be staying in the team under your direct control. I\u2019m not suggesting there\u2019s anything special between us, but nothing good ever comes out of abandoning your wife. Got that, bastard?\u201d", "\u201cHey, Chohong!\u201d", "Chohong flew off after saying what was on her mind.", "Seol Jihu was disappointed by her reaction, but what could he do when she didn\u2019t want the position of a team leader?", "However, he could not fully let go of the idea of making the original members as team leaders. So, he asked one more person.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d", "The reaction was as expected.", "\u201cWhy, why are you doing this? You startled me, saying such weird stuff.\u201d", "The reaction was something more than a refusal.", "\u201cM-Miss Phi Sora, listen.\u201d", "\u201cYou already know, dear, why I\u2019m not taking the offer. Do you want to see me cry a river?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThank you for thinking of me so highly, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll take it for now. I will maybe reconsider it when I get better later, alright? Please.\u201d", "Because she seemed so desperate, Seol Jihu could only turn back before finishing his explanation. Knowing Phi Sora\u2019s trauma, he didn\u2019t want to force the role onto her.", "\u2018I guess I don\u2019t really have a choice.\u2019", "In the end, he decided to keep the original members in their current team and have new members form new teams.", "Kim Hannah also wanted Phi Sora to take charge of a team, but she said things turning out this way wasn\u2019t necessarily bad.", "Her logic was that the representative\u2019s status would be elevated if all the founding members were in his team.", "But he left Attack Team 1\u2019s spot empty just in case anything changed.", "\u2018She has the experience and skills.\u2019", "Although she might complain if she knew, Seol Jihu thought there was no one else as a better fit as Phi Sora for the team leader. Both her status window and her past battles proved this point.", "Since Phi Sora also left the door open, Seol Jihu planned to eventually make Phi Sora Valhalla\u2019s vanguard.", "And as he was spending his days like a headless chicken, the guest he had been waiting for visited Valhalla."]}
