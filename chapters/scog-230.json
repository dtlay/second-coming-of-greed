Am I not supposed to buy anything at the auction house right now?\u201d", "\u201cNot necessarily.

Auction houses are a business run by Earthlings.\u201d", "Kim Hannah scolded him, then began to show off her skills while putting on foundation.", "\u201cThere is a separate auction house for VIPs. A private one that only big spenders know about. Good items are left out of public auctions to be sold there.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened as this was the first time he was hearing about such a thing. This seemed to be why nothing caught his fancy at Scheherazade\u2019s famous auction house.", "\u201cIn the end, all items going to the public auction are dregs that didn\u2019t quite make the cut. Of course, those dregs aren\u2019t half-bad, but they\u2019re not something someone with hundreds of gold coins would be using. They\u2019re good, but not something that could be shown to VIPs.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smirked as she put on her concealer.", "\u201cPeople who burn their energy at public auctions are true fools.

He just saw her putting on her concealer, but now she was powdering her face.", "\u2018How?\u2019", "\u201cOh yeah, when do you plan on going back?\u201d", "\u201cHuh? I\u2019ve only been here for a day.\u201d", "\u201cCome on, didn\u2019t I tell you? Are you going to buy dregs? You said you became a High Ranker, didn\u2019t you?

Nothing good will come out of staying here for too long.\u201d", "Kim Hannah studied herself in the mirror before nodding her head and getting up.", "Seol Jihu became speechless.", "\u2018They say that a woman\u2019s transformation is innocent, but this\u2026\u2019", "Her facial features were now more clearly defined, and Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t get accustomed to it. He even felt like her face was glowing radiantly.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be too aggrieved though. You avoid a pile of shit on the ground not because it\u2019s scary, but because it\u2019s dirty.\u201d", "She tied her neatly combed hair into a ponytail, then finished her transformation into a professional woman by wearing her two-piece jacket, coffee-colored stockings, and work skirt.", "\u201cI have to get going now.

As expected, his teammates were sprawled around the same room, sleeping.", "He could only imagine how much they drank by the smell of alcohol overflowing from the place.", "Unsurprisingly, no one woke up even after he shook them strongly. In fact, they frowned and waved their hands in the air as if to shoo away a fly.", "The only solace in the situation was that Marcel Ghionea came to his senses instantly.", "Pondering what to do, Seol Jihu came up with a good idea.", "And that was to put his comrades\u2019 faces as close as possible to Hugo\u2019s armpits and crotch.", "The effect was instantaneous. Chohong, who was placed under Hugo\u2019s left armpit, woke up in a few minutes screaming all kinds of swear words.", "It was the same for Phi Sora, who was placed on the other side.", "\u201cFuck!\u201d", "She furrowed her brows and spat out a single powerful word the moment she woke up.", "Seol Jihu held his laughter back and approached her.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2014 I was sleeping well and suddenly\u2026 argh, damn it. I can still smell the putrid smell.\u201d", "Phi Sora groaned and spat on the floor. She clearly looked disgusted.", "\u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s time to get up.

Wash up before it cools down.\u201d", "Seol Jihu forced the grumbling Phi Sora into the bathroom.", "Maria held out well under Hugo\u2019s crotch, but she soon reached her limit when Hugo farted.", "\u201cKuheu~ That felt nice.\u201d", "It must have been quite the load as Hugo muttered in sleep.", "\u201c!?\u201d", "Of course, it was like a bolt of lightning to Maria, who started dry heaving after being forced up.", "\u201cUuuek! Uwwwueeek\u2014!\u201d", "She vomited while crying.", "\u201cFuck, you motherfucking piece of fucking shit!\u201d", "She screamed with resentment and fury while shoving her crucifix artifact up Hugo\u2019s butt.", "As a result, Hugo also woke up screaming.", "Marcel Ghionea, who dazedly watched the entire scene unfold, shook in fear as he saw Seol Jihu cackling to himself after such a cruel act.", "While a small ruckus broke out, the team members didn\u2019t raise any strong objections against going back to Haramark.", "The main reason was the lack of good items at the auction house.", "Seol Jihu was happy he didn\u2019t need to convince them, but he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if their real goal had been to come to drink Scheherazade\u2019s expensive liquor.", "In any case, good news was good news. Seol Jihu checked out of the inn and headed to the stable near the southern gate.", "\u201cHuaaaam. You could have let us sleep more\u2026 it\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a hurry\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora grumbled as she yawned big.", "Seol Jihu made a somewhat apologetic face.", "Maria was also suffering from an upset stomach.", "\u201cSo I\u2019m the only one who benefited from this trip to the capital.\u201d", "Hugo grinned proudly as he sat down in the carriage.", "Seol Jihu thought about telling Hugo what Kim Hannah told him earlier about auctions, but decided against it. There was no need to spoil his mood when he was personally satisfied.", "\u201cAh\u2026 did I drink too much? Why does my head ring so much\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t repress his laughter seeing Chohong moaning along with Maria.", "\u201cYou should have had some hangover soup. You had time.\u201d", "\u201cI was too lazy\u2026 anyway, let\u2019s set out already.

Just sleep for now.\u201d", "\u201cI was going to sleep once the carriage started. If I sleep now, I\u2019ll wake up when the carriage sets out.

Wait just a little longer.\u201d", "Agreeing with her fully, Seol Jihu took out a communication crystal from his pocket. It was then.", "The carriage door shot open with a clunk, and a familiar woman appeared behind it.", "She looked just like when she left the inn except for the backpack she was wearing.", "Kim Hannah looked inside the carriage and nodded.", "\u201cI\u2019m right on time.\u201d", "\u201cWho the hell is\u2026\u201d", "Chohong paused before finishing her sentence.", "She recognized the new face. She had even seen her before.", "When Seol Jihu fell into a coma, Chohong ran into Kim Hannah a couple of times when she came to visit him.", "Seol Jihu opened his mouth.", "\u201cYou got here earlier than I thought.\u201d", "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much to take care of. The transfer of duties ended recently, and I already had my belongings packed.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you made sure to throw your resignation letter at your boss\u2019s face?\u201d", "\u201cDo you think I went to film a morning-time drama?\u201d", "Chohong wasn\u2019t the only one.

The team members were maintaining their silence, and Kim Hannah didn\u2019t say anything either. She only kept an upright posture, staring outside.", "An invisible wall seemed to be standing between Kim Hannah and the rest of the team.", "This couldn\u2019t be helped. Everyone had understood the situation when Seol Jihu mentioned the word \u2018resignation letter\u2019.", "Chohong had once mocked Seol Jihu, saying Kim Hannah and Seo Yuhui had reached the pinnacle of their respective fields and that she would serve him as her \u2018hyung\u2019 if he managed to recruit even one of them.", "Of course, strictly speaking, Kim Hannah couldn\u2019t be placed at the same level as Seo Yuhui. But it was an undeniable truth that she was a well-respected Earthling in her field.", "Simply put, this was the same thing as a world-class athlete at the peak of their performance transferring over to a second division team that was just starting to make a name for itself.", "\u201cUm\u2026\u201d", "In the end, Marcel Ghionea spoke up, unable to rein in his curiosity.", "\u201cLeader, what is this about\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cAh, um\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 where do I begin\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu crossed his arms and smacked his lips.", "\u201cI was going to tell you guys once we arrive at Haramark, but I guess I\u2019ll just say it now.\u201d", "Seol Jihu gathered everyone\u2019s attention.", "\u201cCarpe Diem will soon develop into an organization.

She did not found White Rose itself.", "\u201cNo one knows, right? We needed an expert administrator to help us, and things just kind of fell in place and I recruited her.\u201d", "\u201cWow, what an explanation.\u201d", "Chohong let out an empty chuckle.", "It was easy to believe him since the proof was right in front of their eyes, but what everyone was wondering wasn\u2019t why he recruited Kim Hannah.", "It was how he managed to coax the infamous Miss Foxy, who was affiliated with Sinyoung, Paradise\u2019s greatest organization.", "\u201cOh yeah, don\u2019t we need a Magician too?
