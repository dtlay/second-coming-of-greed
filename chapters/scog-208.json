Although their destination was the border region, it wasn\u2019t too difficult to find a ride since it was closer to the Federation\u2019s side.", "By adding a little bit of extra money, Seol Jihu signed a contract for two carriages for a trip to the entrance of the border region.", "Finally, he bought a common set of spear and armor, thinking they would only be for a one time use.

He felt like it was just yesterday that he came to Haramark with nothing but a backpack, but now he was leading an expedition of high caliber with such a force.", "Once everyone arrived, the group split into two groups of four and got on to the carriages.", "The two Archers, Kazuki and Marcel Ghionea, were first split, and the rest decided which carriage they wanted to take.", "Seol Jihu debated which carriage to ride before seeing Phi Sora hop on Kazuki\u2019s carriage and following her.
