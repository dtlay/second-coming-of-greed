W-Why are you\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu glared at Kim Hannah sharply as Kim Hannah pressed buttons on Eun Yuri\u2019s phone.", "\u201cOkay, okay, I was a bit too harsh. I promise.

I told them to do it.", "\u201cYou did?\u201d", "\u2014With your personality, I figured you\u2019d enter Paradise right away. But now that I think about it, it was a bit harsh. I\u2019m sorry.", "\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to apologize\u2026 I know you\u2019re thinking of my best interest.\u201d", "Jang Maldong let out a faint chuckle.", "\u2014Anyway, you should go with us. It will be a good chance to get some rest. Besides, do you really think I\u2019m going just to have fun?", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u2014You\u2019ll know once you get there. There\u2019s something I want to show you and someone I want to introduce to you too.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t refuse with Jang Maldong putting it this way.

I apologize.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m angry, do you?\u201d", "Seol Jihu snapped at her.", "\u201cI understand your intent, but if you were that worried, you could have just asked for it.
