But I would like you to ask them anyway. The Star of Sloth is a Magician like me. If she helps, she will become a huge part of our battle power.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded in agreement. If Philip Muller would go out of his way to talk to two other Executors, talking to Cinzia was the least he could do.", "\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d", "\u201cGood.\u201d", "Philip Muller let out a short sigh before taking out a crystal orb and putting it on the table.", "\u201cContact me when you get Haramark\u2019s reply. We can share each other\u2019s progress then.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took the communication crystal as if it was a precious treasure.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry for visiting you out of the blue. I enjoyed talking with you. It was a very hopeful time.\u201d", "Seol Jihu felt a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.", "Hopeful time.

To be honest, I debated talking to you casually several times during our conversation.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable doing this.\u201d", "The Star of Avarice spoke discontentedly before hurriedly leaving the building. Seol Jihu, who was talking with Odelette Delphine, suddenly shouted.", "\u201cMister Philip Muller!\u201d", "Philip Muller stopped, his head turning around and showing his clear eyes.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu expressed his thanks. To be honest, that was all he could think of.", "He felt reassured for some reason. It was like someone appeared out of nowhere to hold him up when he was wandering around in the darkness with a body that could collapse at any moment. And he was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t fall. You got this. You can lean on me if you\u2019re tired.\u2019", "\u201cAbout what?\u201d", "\u201cJust, everything. Take good care of me.\u201d", "Philip Muller blinked rapidly, taken aback by Seol Jihu\u2019s gratitude.

He finally felt like he was making some progress.", "*", "Seol Jihu prepared to leave for Haramark that very day.", "What Philip Muller said wasn\u2019t wrong. No one knew what would happen to the Middle World while they were in the Spirit Realm.", "They needed to prepare as much as they could before leaving so that the Middle World would hold out until the World Tree\u2019s revival, even if that only meant a futile struggle.", "\u201cJihu~\u201d", "While Seol Jihu was busy packing his bags, Seo Yuhui walked into the office.", "\u201cAh, Noona, you\u2019re here.\u201d", "\u201cMhm. I heard from Miss Kim Hannah. You\u2019re going to Haramark?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t forget to share how things were progressing. To be more precise, Seol Jihu told Kim Hannah, and Kim Hannah relayed the message to the members.", "Given the scale of the operation, he had to tell them early on so they could accept it more easily later.", "In truth, most of them had known Seol Jihu\u2019s goal since the moment the Halep siblings and Hoshino Urara came.", "Perhaps because of it, clouds of war were beginning to swirl around Valhalla. Some of the sharper members had already gone into intense training or equipment inspection.", "\u201cOh right, have you fully recovered?\u201d", "\u201cMmmn, I\u2019m still holding onto Moirai\u2019s Souvenir.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 You haven\u2019t used it yet?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui gave a bitter smile.", "\u201cTo tell you the truth, there\u2019s something I want to do\u2026 but given the circumstances, it looks like I should recover my strength.\u201d\u2018Something she wants to do?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "What did she want to do with Moirai\u2019s Souvenir?", "\u201cAnyway, look at your face! Jeez. The Neutral Zone\u2019s over, yet it\u2019s become so thin again.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui reached out and carefully grasped Seol Jihu\u2019s emaciated face. The soft, warm touch almost made Seol Jihu fall asleep, but he barely held himself together.", "Seo Yuhui was truly a devilish woman. If he loosened his focus and went into her arms, he would forever be unable to escape.", "\u201cWhat a pity.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d", "\u201cFine? I don\u2019t think so. Say, is there anything this noona can help you with?\u201d", "Hearing this, Seol Jihu flinched. He would have said he was fine if it was at any other time. But maybe because he met with Philip Muller, a certain thought crossed his mind.", "That they had to gather all of humanity\u2019s battle power.", "And this naturally made him recall one particular person.", "\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cMhm, anything is okay, so tell me.\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu hesitate, Seo Yuhui consoled him by gently caressing his cheek.", "Seol Jihu asked with difficulty.", "\u201cCan you bring someone here?\u201d", "\u201cHm?\u201d", "\u201cDuring the valley war, there was someone who saved me before I was killed by Undying Diligence.

The Sacred Empress, right?\u201d", "Paradise\u2019s first Level 8 Earthling, the Sacred Empress.", "In truth, Seol Jihu did not know much about her.

But if we unite with the remaining forces of the Spirit Realm, we might just be able to\u2026]", "That was what the future Eun Yuri said. That the method of using the spring was limited.", "Although he would have to go there to be sure, it sounded like there was a limit to how many people could enter through the spring.", "This meant he needed to form a powerful team with a small number of people.", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "And so, Seol Jihu made this shameless request.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure she will be of great help to my plan. I\u2019m positive.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui bit her lower lip. Thinking about it, it was entirely possible for them to face an Army Commander. She knew how busily Seol Jihu was working in preparation of this plan.", "More importantly, there was simply no way she could refuse an earnest request from her cutie pie.", "\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d", "In the end, she agreed.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s complexion brightened instantly.", "\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her.

Looking at the worn-down place, he was reminded of the past.", "He wanted to enter but forced himself to turn away. Even if he went in, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone inside.", "Jang Maldong was training the three newbies in Huge Stone Rocky Mountain, and it wouldn\u2019t be until late tonight that he would come back.", "On the other hand, he didn\u2019t have time to be engrossed in his sentiments. He had to go on this expedition as soon as possible and hasten the World Tree\u2019s revival.", "Every minute was of utmost importance.", "\u2018I don\u2019t have the faintest clue how Miss Cinzia will respond.\u2019", "He had already called Teresa on his way and let her know. Although she didn\u2019t hesitate to accept his request, just as he expected, she couldn\u2019t give a definitive answer when it came to mobilizing Sicilia.", "This wasn\u2019t a matter of another city, but a matter of another organization. So even if the Haramark Royal Family issued a conscription call, there was a chance Cinzia would not comply.", "Seol Jihu thought the same way.", "\u2018I doubt she will mobilize so easily.\u2019", "He needed a way. A method to make the Star of Sloth move.", "Soon, he began to see the fluttering flag of Sicilia\u2019s building in the distance.", "Feeling parched, Seol Jihu swallowed hard.", "*", "\u201cWhat a surprise, what a surprise.\u201d", "Taciana Cinzia, boss of Sicilia and the head of the southern war hawks, was the same as always \u2014 a thick crimson coat draping over her shoulders like a cloak, the red hair flowing down like the mane of a lion, and a voice tinged with boredom.", "\u201cIt feels like it was just yesterday that you came to Haramark. Now you\u2019ve gone beyond the position of Carpe Diem\u2019s leader and risen to be the representative of a city. Purely based on position, we are on equal levels.\u201d", "\u201cI just got lucky.\u201d", "\u201cI see you\u2019re still needlessly modest. Well, you were a peculiar one since the Neutral Zone.\u201d", "As Cinzia put a cigar in her mouth and bit down, Agnes, who was standing straight next to her, lit it in a smooth motion.", "\u201cI wonder how you\u2019ll be the next time we meet. What do you think, Agnes?\u201d", "\u201cI do not have an opinion.\u201d", "Agnes retorted bluntly while retracting her hand.", "A languid smile hung on Cinzia\u2019s face.", "\u201cMy, it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve met this child of yours. Aren\u2019t you being a bit cold?\u201d", "\u201cI did not mean I had nothing to say. It is just that he is doing fine by himself.\u201d", "\u201cBut can\u2019t you say something as his mother? Like encouraging him to aim for the position of an Executor.\u201d", "\u201cMother? I\u2019m a maiden who is yet to marry.\u201d", "Cinzia cackled at Agnes\u2019 flat denial.", "\u201cTry to understand. She might be acting cool, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s sulking on the inside.\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Miss Agnes is sulking?\u201d", "\u201cMm, who can blame her? You left Haramark without saying a word to her. Agnes was quite heartbroken at the time.\u201d", "\u201cJust to be clear\u2014!\u201d", "Agnes raised her voice in a flash.", "\u201cI was not \u2018heartbroken\u2019 in the slightest. I did not care much.\u201d", "\u201cHmm, I thought I saw someone snooping around the empty building that night.\u201d", "A short \u2018keuk\u2019 rang out. Agnes clenched her teeth as her face began to turn red.", "Cinzia burst out into laughter, clapping her hands.", "\u201cSorry, sorry. It\u2019s just that the two of you make for a good picture. I almost want to force you two to marry, just so I can watch your married life.\u201d", "\u201cPlease spare me the nonsense.\u201d", "\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d", "Cinzia waved her hand.", "\u201cThat\u2019s enough joking around for me too. Now, let\u2019s go back to the reason the renowned Valhalla Representative has visited Sicilia.\u201d", "Ssp. The sound of air being sucked in rang out, and a white smoke flowed out from between Cinzia\u2019s red lips.", "As Seol Jihu was preparing to give the speech he prepared\u2014", "\u201cWell, I can take a guess.\u201d", "Cinzia seized the initiative.", "\u201cThe Federation\u2019s visit and the recent visit of the Star of Avarice. Just these two is enough information. Though, I still don\u2019t understand why the Eva Royal Family released Hoshino Urara.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t show it, but he was surprised on the inside. His recent activities seemed to have spread to Haramark.", "Considering how Philip Muller knew of these matters too, Paradise\u2019s titans seemed to be paying careful attention to him.", "\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not like Sicilia stalked you. You see, the Star of Avarice has been poking around a lot recently.\u201d", "Cinzia clicked her tongue.", "\u201cIt\u2019s obvious why a couch potato like him would be moving around so busily.\u201d", "Cinzia looked up as she tapped the ashes of her cigar into a wine glass. At the same time, Seol Jihu felt his nervousness rear its head.", "In that split second, the atmosphere around Cinzia changed completely. Previously, she had languid eyes that liked to joke around. Now, her eyes were flashing like a predator in front of its prey.", "Seol Jihu could feel an indescribable pressure that would make even Hoshino Urara shut up.", "\u201c\u2026Come to think of it, I was the manager when you entered the Neutral Zone.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cDo you remember what I said back then in front of everyone?\u201d", "\u201c\u2018It was a real chore to look after you lot. Let's not meet ever again?\u2019\u201d", "\u201cNo, not that.\u201d", "Cinzia locked her fingers together and leaned back against the couch. With her chin slightly tilted, she said arrogantly.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know how to speak in a roundabout way, nor do I know how to hide true intent behind false words.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "\u201cSince Representative Seol has taken the time to visit despite his busy schedule, I will answer right away. So that neither of us wastes any time.\u201d", "Cinzia then spoke without dragging on any longer.", "Seol Jihu had a suspicion\u2014", "\u201cWe refuse.\u201d", "Which quickly came true.", "\u201cSicilia has no intention of joining hands with Valhalla and the Magician\u2019s Guild to participate in the plan to rescue the Federation. Thus, we have no plans to interfere in this matter in any way.\u201d", "Taking out the cigar in her mouth and flicking it into the wine glass, Cinzia finished clearly.", "\u201cThis is my answer.\u201d"]}
