{"cid": "109", "title": "Chapter 109. At the End of the Hellish Training", "content": ["Time flowed like a stream. On the third week, an incident popped up causing Ayase Kazuki to leave the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain. He seemed to want to stay until the last day, but after he was contacted by his comrades, he showed a rare expression of anger. It seemed something unexpected occurred while preparing for the Banquet. In the end, Kazuki asked Jang Maldong to be excused and left for Haramark on the same day.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t hear the details, but since Kazuki personally had to go back to deal with it, he guessed it wasn\u2019t a small problem.", "Once Kazuki left, Evil\u2026 no, Agnes also lost her reason to stay as an observer. She didn\u2019t go back right away; instead, she helped Seol Jihu train for another week before returning to Haramark.", "Not knowing the inside story, Seol Jihu carefully guessed that Agnes was running away from Jang Maldong\u2019s training.", "Although the group of five was now reduced to three, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t mind it too much. In fact, he was a bit happy, as this meant that he was spending more time under Jang Maldong\u2019s watch. Now that he had experienced Jang Maldong\u2019s training, he could easily understand why he was called Paradise\u2019s best trainer. He had more than a few good points that made him worthy of his reputation.", "First, he prioritized the process more than the result. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care about the result, just that he encouraged his students to make gains from the process.", "He made his students understand the goal of the training and realize what they were lacking. In a way, it was as if he was fattening them up little by little.", "Seol Jihu, who only knew how to train his physical body, fell in love with the new sixth sense training method. He felt like a new horizon was opening up for him every day.", "Jang Maldong didn\u2019t hate it either. Unlike certain ungrateful idiots, this new disciple of his was excited to train and was constantly asking for more. How could he possibly not be pleased?", "As a result, Seol Jihu felt the emotion known as \u2018joy\u2019 for the first time in ages. Even though he was both physically and mentally exhausted, he was happy to train without caring about anything else.", "To top it off, he had someone guiding him and he could feel himself getting stronger by the day.", "He didn\u2019t even realize the time passing as he enjoyed spending each and every day on Huge Stone Rocky Mountain.", "Time flew, and the night of the fifth and final week came by.", "*", "The past 35 days were long to Hugo but short to Seol Jihu. Jang Maldong went all out during training, but he didn\u2019t strangle his students for time in their everyday life. He notified Chohong that they would be returning the next day and held a small party.", "He definitely wasn\u2019t the type to take lead and hold such a thing, but he couldn\u2019t help himself because Seol Jihu was so endearing.", "As a result, he personally went out and captured a wild boar that incidentally looked just like Hugo. He prepared the boar, built a fire, and cooked it all by himself. Adding together a whiskey cooled in the mountain\u2019s flowing stream water, he truly felt like he was in paradise.", "\u201cKeu!\u201d", "Hugo took a bite out of the scrumptious meat along with a sip of whiskey. After emptying the glass clean, he became overly chatty, saying he\u2019d have no regrets if he died right now.", "Jang Maldong\u2019s cooking skills were unexpectedly good, so Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t get his act together as he devoured the meat. The meat practically melted in his mouth, giving off a sweet, savory flavor.", "In truth, with only a single dish, the meal could hardly be called a party. However, Seol Jihu enjoyed this moment and made it an unforgettable memory.", "As the night advanced, the fat boar was left with only its bones and the blazing campfire with only flickering embers.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t defeat the after-meal languor and sprawled down on the ground. His body was devoid of tension since he ate and drank to his heart\u2019s content. But rather than staying on the ground and looking at the stars, he jumped up and stretched.", "Wondering why he was fussing around at this hour, Jang Maldong, who was cleaning up the mess, asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d", "\u201cWarming up\u2026. Ah, let me help you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stopped twisting his body side to side and ran to help with the clean-up. From the way he was hurrying so much, Jang Maldong could tell he was dying to start training. On the other hand, he let out a sigh as he glanced at Hugo, who was lying on the ground belly up.", "\u201cPathetic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d", "\u201cMe? N-No, not at all.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve never defeated Hugo before.\u201d", "Jang Maldong meant to say \u2018Hugo was a good-for-nothing who only knew how to eat and drink\u2019, but Seol Jihu seemed to have taken it as Hugo slacking off on training.", "Jang Maldong laughed inwardly. Unless the young man\u2019s head was filled with nothing but training, he wouldn\u2019t have understood it that way.", "\u201cHe\u2019s always ahead of me when we\u2019re running, and he can dodge the logs a lot longer than me\u2026.\u201d Seol Jihu continued to mutter in his misunderstanding, but Jang Maldong didn\u2019t point out his error.", "Humans were rather simple creatures at times. The moment they were satisfied, they would start to fall behind. If Seol Jihu ever went, \u2018I\u2019ve trained so much. I should be more than strong now\u2019, then Jang Maldong planned to teach him a lesson.", "Of course, it was true that Seol Jihu put in a lot of effort. Even by basic calculations, he had done 119 days\u2019 worth of training.", "But from Jang Maldong\u2019s perspective, Seol Jihu had only filled a small portion of what he was lacking. If he were satisfied when he only just built his foundation, his growth would slow down.", "However, Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t satisfied. He didn\u2019t let his guard down or look down on others just because he did some training. Jang Maldong wasn\u2019t sure if that was just how the young man was, but as far as he could see, it was one of his few strong points.", "\u201cHugo has been doing these for several years now, so it should be second nature to him. To be honest, he didn\u2019t need to come here in the first place.\u201d", "\u201cMhm.\u201d", "Hugo nodded his head arrogantly while still lying down on the ground. Seeing this, Jang Maldong immediately raised his cane, saying \u201cYou idiot\u2026.\u201d", "Hugo screamed and ran off.", "\u201cDamned fool.\u201d Jang Maldong shook his head.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go take a walk. It\u2019s not good for your stomach to run right after a meal.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was about to ask, \u2018If that\u2019s the case, why did you push me so hard the first week?\u2019 But in the end, he quietly followed him. Thinking about it now, it seemed that he wanted him to face his limits. Of course, the real reason was that he still hadn\u2019t put his cane down.", "Soon, when the duo arrived at a small open area, Jang Maldong opened his mouth. \u201cI heard from Miss Agnes that you were worried about becoming a High Ranker.\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cYou weren\u2019t? Then did Miss Agnes lie?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026No.\u201d", "\u201cStinking brat, you\u2019re worried about the High Rank when you\u2019re not even Level 4 yet?\u201d", "Jang Maldong snickered. Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know what to say, so he just scratched his head. He thought Agnes was pretty tight-mouthed, so he took this as her way of getting back at him for the butt incident.", "\u201cWell, considering the speed of your growth\u2026. Right, let me ask you while we\u2019re at it. What do you think the High Rank is?\u201d", "Seol Jihu could only blink his eyes at the unexpected question.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to think so hard about it. High Rank. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like \u2014 a high position. Now, what do you think \u2018position\u2019 refers to?\u201d", "\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. Now that you mention it, I guess it\u2019s kind of vague. I doubt you\u2019re asking me for the dictionary definition.\u201d", "\u201cOf course not. I think it refers to a realm.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu stayed silent, Jang Maldong changed his question.", "\u201cHow many High Rankers do you think there are in Paradise?\u201d", "\u201cI have no idea.\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked as if Jang Maldong was asking him a stupid question. After all, how would he know anything about it?", "\u201cHm, let\u2019s see\u2026. If you consider this mountain to be the population of Earth\u2026\u201d Jang Maldong raised his cane. \u201cThen this surrounding area would be people who are given the opportunity to enter Paradise.\u201d", "He took a look around their immediate vicinity and said, \u201cThe ones who pass the Tutorial and the Neutral Zone, and actually enter Paradise would be here.\u201d He poked the small open space where he and Seol Jihu were standing.", "\u201cAnd the people who survive for a few years to become Level 4s would be\u2026 in here.\u201d He dragged his cane on the dirt and drew a large circle. It was about one fourth the size of the open space.", "\u201cAnd the people who become High Rankers\u2026.\u201d Jang Maldong bent down. He grabbed a handful of dirt and showed it to Seol Jihu, \u201c\u2026Are here.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was watching him slowly and a small lump went down his throat. Seeing Jang Maldong put it like this, he realized just how amazing High Rankers were.", "Kim Hannah\u2019s words suddenly brushed past his head. She\u2019d said that even the gifted needed 4-5 years to get to Level 5.", "\u201cThen\u2014\u201d", "After staying silent for a long time, Seol Jihu asked calmly, \u201cIn your opinion, how many among them are \u2018true\u2019 High Rankers?\u201d", "Jang Maldong grinned. He opened his palm, and the dirt fell through his fingers. What remained in his hand was only a tiny fraction.", "\u201cAnd these true High Rankers, you said they\u2019re the ones who learn things on their own and grow without relying on Paradise\u2019s system?\u201d Seol Jihu asked with a hint of anticipation. Jang Maldong thought for a moment before shaking his head.", "\u201cYou\u2019re half right and half wrong.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cI call them true and false High Rankers, but it isn\u2019t as if any wandering dog can become a High Ranker.\u201d Jang Maldong continued, \u201cFirst, I want to make it clear that I have no intention of undermining any High Ranker. Not a single one of them rose to that position by sitting on the sidelines and taking a dump. They must have had their fair share of struggles.\u201d", "Jang Maldong dusted off his hand. Then, he quietly announced the twist.", "\u201cBut\u2026 as you might have already experienced, Paradise attracts all sorts of people.\u201d", "\u201cRight.\u201d", "\u201cYou can tell just by what goes on in the Neutral Zone. Among the dozens of newbies, there are always one or two special ones. The so-called gifted ones.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was reminded of Odelette Delphine and nodded his head subconsciously.", "\u201cBut the funny thing is, there are differences even among the gifted ones. The one who\u2019s more talented, the one who\u2019s more special. You can go on and on, and eventually, you\u2019ll find someone who\u2019s unrivaled among the gifted.\u201d", "\u2018A heaven beyond heaven.\u2019 Seol Jihu suddenly thought of this saying.", "\u201cPeople like that will go above learning skills on their own and will tread their own paths. They will enter unique realms no one else has ever reached. I call that Enlightenment.\u201d", "\u2018An independent path? A unique realm?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head and asked, \u201cCould Dylan have\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Dylan\u2019s lightning, you\u2019re a bit off. Infusing electricity into mana \u2014 the idea is good, but that only constitutes as thinking outside the box. It\u2019s far from Enlightenment.\u201d", "\u201cWhat about Chohong?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s the same. Chohong is a special case. Because she is originally a Priest, she only strengthened her Manifestation ability.\u201d", "It was quite a stingy evaluation considering that Carpe Diem was one of Haramark\u2019s best teams. Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure I get it.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to. Well, I\u2019m not trying to discuss martial arts theories with you, but\u2026.\u201d Jang Maldong took a brief pause before opening his mouth again.", "\u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve seen someone move like his body and weapon were one. That wasn\u2019t something as simple as a movement technique.\u201d", "Moving like the body and weapon were one?", "\u201cAre you talking about the famous One With the Sword?\u201d Seol Jihu asked, remembering the martial arts novels he used to read.", "\u201cI\u2019ve heard that it was something like that.\u201d", "When Jang Maldong agreed, Seol Jihu\u2019s expression waned.", "\u201cOne person seeks the path of Formlessness. Another seeks the path of the Thousand Sword.\u201d", "\u201cPuha!\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s laughter interrupted Jang Maldong. The former quickly covered his mouth.", "\u201cIs that funny?\u201d", "\u201cN-No, it\u2019s just that the names\u2026.\u201d", "He was okay with \u2018Formlessness\u2019, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself when he heard \u2018Thousand Sword\u2019. They were both terms he was somewhat familiar with from martial arts novels.", "Seol Jihu put strength into his hand to hold back his laughter. Seeing this, one corner of Jang Maldong\u2019s mouth curled up.", "\u201cHmph, let\u2019s see you laughing when you face a thousand swords flying straight at you.\u201d", "The smile on Seol Jihu\u2019s face vanished. A thousand swords attacking him simultaneously? By commonsense standard, that was simply impossible.", "But because of his past life-threatening experiences, Jang Maldong\u2019s words didn\u2019t seem like a joke.", "\u201cBrat, don\u2019t ridicule them unless you\u2019ve pioneered your own independent realm and can stand toe-to-toe with them.\u201d", "\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not laughing because I\u2019m ridiculing them.\u201d", "\u201cI know. The name Thousand Sword is a bit strange. I laughed when I first heard it too.\u201d", "\u201cYou too?\u201d", "\u201cMm. His abilities are the real deal though\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong rubbed his forearm as if he was reminded of a bad memory.", "\u201cAnyways, these are who I call true High Rankers.\u201d", "\u2018If High Rankers are that amazing\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu made a tired expression before clearing his throat and asking, \u201cSir, what about the Unique Rank?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jang Maldong answered immediately.", "\u201cI can say this and that about High Rankers because I am a High Ranker myself.\u201d", "He tilted his head up and looked at the sky.", "\u201cBut the Unique Rankers\u2026 are like the stars in the sky. I can\u2019t get anywhere close to them even if I reach out my hands, so how can I dare to evaluate them?\u201d", "Seol Jihu let out a long sigh. He felt that he still had a long way to go. At the same time, he found out that he was just a frog in a well. The world was wide, and there were many gifted people.", "Seeing the young man\u2019s dejected look, Jang Maldong smiled, \u201cYou were laughing before, but now you\u2019re all down?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026It just seems so far out of reach.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s there to worry about? You\u2019re also walking your own path and making proper preparations for it. Though, we don\u2019t know what lies at the end of it.\u201d", "\u201cMaking preparations? What do you mean? \u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? That you have to constantly devote yourself to balance your mind, technique, and body before becoming a High Ranker. This isn\u2019t an easy thing to do.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head as if he had no clue what Jang Maldong was talking about.", "\u201cNever in my life have I seen someone whose mind, technique, and body are so twisted.\u201d", "\u201cYou mean\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cNever mind true and false and all that. Just focus on balancing your mind, technique, and body. It\u2019s not an easy path to tread, but I believe it has potential.\u201d", "\u2018Balancing the mind, technique, and body\u2019\u2014 the moment he heard this, vitality returned to his lifeless eyes.", "\u201cI\u2019m going to go running.\u201d", "Seol Jihu immediately turned around. Now that he was shown a way to get stronger, his body became heated until it couldn\u2019t handle standing still.", "\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but do it in moderation. It\u2019s still dark, and if you get hurt, you won\u2019t be able to go to the Banquet.\u201d", "Seol Jihu flinched in the middle of putting on his sandbags.", "\u201cAnd if you get the opportunity, you can attempt Stage 3 as well. Go see what position you\u2019re in.\u201d", "\u201cSir?\u201d", "Seol Jihu turned his head. Seeing his dropped jaw, Jang Maldong clicked his tongue.", "\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself. Entering Stage 3 is all up to luck. It\u2019s not like Dylan and Kazuki couldn\u2019t go because they were lacking in skills.\u201d", "Who cared? Seol Jihu was more than happy to hear Jang Maldong giving him permission. Just this single moment felt like a generous reward for everything he had suffered so far.", "\u201cYes!\u201d", "Seol Jihu shouted with spirit before starting to run. Seeing the young man getting farther away, Jang Maldong revealed his teeth in a grin.", "He had confirmed something with the training in the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain. From what he had observed so far, he could see all sorts of possibilities.", "Jang Maldong put his hand in his pocket and touched his needle case. It was the same case he had vowed to never open again.", "\u2018If it\u2019s him\u2026.\u2019", "His hand fiddled with the case. He knew Seol Jihu was amassing stat points. However, he didn\u2019t know Seol Jihu had several Divine Elixirs along with the Divine Stigmata saved up for when he reached the High Rank. If he did, he might have mulled over his decision a bit more.", "In any case, Jang Maldong\u2019s eyes were clearly burning as he stared in the direction the young man disappeared to. Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t the only one looking forward to the day he became a High Ranker. After all, Jang Maldong was a trainer.", "Just like Agnes, he was thrilled to see a high-quality gem in the rough. And as far as his desire to refine it went, he was confident he wouldn\u2019t lose out to anyone else.", "What would happen when the young man\u2019s chaotic mind, technique, and body became one, or what form it would take\u2014 Jang Maldong had no clue.", "And that only made him look forward to it even more.", "Right! In Jang Maldong\u2019s eyes, Seol Jihu was a gem that only now had begun the refining process. As long as he was refined well, Jang Maldong was confident that he would shine brighter than anyone else.", "After bursting out into a hearty laughter, he let out a few dry coughs.", "\u2018What am I laughing about at this age\u2026.\u2019", "He was a bit embarrassed by his childish anticipation, but the fire in his heart refused to diminish. Thus, to cool the heat in his chest, he had to walk around for a long time.", "Just like that, the final night in Huge Stone Rocky Mountain passed, and morning dawned."]}
