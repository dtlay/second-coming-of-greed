At the same time, it was also why Vulgar Chastity detested humans.", "The fact that this woman knew this term could only mean she was a human from the era of the Empire.", "\u201cImpossible!

The earth froze as well. Wherever the freezing shockwave swept past became icebound with frost.", "Before long, the land turned into a tranquil snowfield. Including the fortress, frost-emitting, bitter coldness enveloped everything within the battlefield.", "It was as if dozens of powerful Blizzard spells were used simultaneously, as though the world had really frozen.", "But what was truly surprising was that the members of the Federation and humanity were unaffected. Although they were standing stiff from this sudden turn of events, the ice had not affected them in the slightest.", "Roselle\u2019s superhuman mana was already surprising, but her control over it was like a divine art.", "With a single spell, she had temporarily silenced the Parasites that were raging like a wild bushfire.", "Even the Parasite Queen was greatly astonished by this sight.", "She was already half-standing. She was so surprised that her butt was no longer touching the throne and her neck was craning forward toward the frost-covered image.", "[What\u2026.]", "She was at a complete loss for words.", "She had received a premonition of great danger. But there was still some hope left. That was why she urged the Army Commanders and ordered an all-out attack.", "She fully expected to succeed when Vulgar Chastity broke through the fortress wall and reached the central area, but\u2026", "[This is\u2026]", "A powerful witch had seemingly appeared out of nowhere and obstructed her well-made plan.", "She could tolerate having a wrench thrown at her near-complete plan once or twice. But now she was simply dumbstruck from having such absurd incidents happen at every crucial moment.", "Of course, it wasn\u2019t over yet.", "The Army Commanders were only pushed back from the sudden storm of coldness. They were still alive.", "The storm must have exterminated the weaker members of the armies, but the more powerful ones should break out of the ice at any time.", "Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, the army could simply be replenished on the spot.", "Right, the war wasn\u2019t over yet.", "But the problem was that the previous attack delayed the fall of Tigol Fortress\u2019 central area by a few dozen seconds.", "One might say it was only a few dozen seconds.", "But what happened just now definitely could not be described as \u2018only\u2019 a few dozen seconds.", "These seconds were enough to twist the history and future of the Federation and humanity, and thus the whole of Paradise.", "[....]", "Staring with a stunned expression, the Parasite Queen slowly raised her head.", "Soon.", "[...I.]", "Her eyes gazing at the celestial bodies closed slowly as if they intuitively foresaw what would happen in the near future.", "[Was I wrong again\u2026?]", "Inside the empty grand-hall, the Queen\u2019s hollow voice rang out.", "Meanwhile\u2026", "The chaos that befell Tigol Fortress quickly died down.", "\u201cWhat happened\u2026?\u201d", "A Sky Fairy, who was crying on her knees, looked around her surroundings with a stupefied face.", "Then.", "\u201c...Ah?\u201d", "Seeing the air, she blinked rapidly in disbelief.", "A tiny spark of light fluttered down from the sky toward her. Reflexively chasing the movement of the light, the Sky Fairy\u2019s head dropped down.", "The glowing light fell squarely on the back of her hand and seeped inside. Then, her strength suddenly left her body and she felt something resonate inside her.", "\u201cAh\u2026 Ah\u2026!\u201d", "The Sky Fairy\u2019s eyes widened and her jaw dropped.", "It was a familiar and reminiscent sensation.", "How could she forget this feeling?", "The Sky Fairy carefully raised her hands even as she shivered from the temporary resonance.", "\u201cMy power is returning\u2026?\u201d", "It was the power of Spirits.", "In the next moment, the Sky Fairy raised her eyes with great difficulty.", "\u201c!\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t just her.", "Countless glowing lights were fluttering down from the sky, illuminating the whole world. Dancing down from the sky, they found their masters and fell on to their hands.", "Not just to the Sky Fairies, but also to the Cave Fairies.", "\u201cAh\u2026 Ah\u2026.\u201d", "Gasping from the emotion welling up inside her, the Sky Fairy turned toward the World Tree in the distance.", "She then moved her gaze up toward the sky above it. The dark clouds filling the sky had split open, and a light was shining down from the crack in the sky.", "No, the light was falling down.", "She wasn\u2019t seeing things nor hallucinating.", "The light was really coming down.", "Kwaaaaaaaa!", "From the split sky, a cluster of light poured down. The light enveloped the dead tree, and soon, a large pillar of light connecting the tree and the sky was built.", "Right, what everyone in the Middle World was longing for was happening at last.", "It was the revival of the World Tree\u2014", "\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d", "And the return of the King.", "Sorry for the delay guys! - Momo"]}
