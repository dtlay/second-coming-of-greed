Who do you think you are!? You wanna be the leader, huh!?\u201d", "Now, the leader was pointing his finger at him and yelling.

I didn\u2019t educate my underling properly\u2026 haha.\u201d", "He rubbed his hands together and smiled grovelingly. Seol Jihu blinked his eyes.", "\u201cAh! Hold on just a moment. Oi!
