{"cid": "270", "title": "Chapter 270. Jackpot (1)", "content": ["Charlotte Aria was only able to escape from Sorg K\u00fchne after two hours.", "\u201cHaaaaaah.\u201d", "This was why she did not want to grant him an audience. Ever since her second brother Campbell Aria died, he nagged her constantly whenever he saw her.", "After experiencing it for a few years, just seeing his face made her heart sink and her stomach churn. Sometimes, Charlotte Aria would fail to hold back her temper and lash out, and whenever that happened, the desire to chase Sorg K\u00fchne out increased.", "Of course, it always stopped at just a mere thought, and she never tried to actually carry it out.", "Charlotte Aria was young and immature as a \u2018queen\u2019, but it was difficult to consider her a bad \u2018person\u2019. She wasn\u2019t so heartless as to chase out an old servant who had served the royal family in times of need for dozens of years.", "Nicely put, she was innocent. Badly put, she was indecisive and weak-willed.", "To be a wicked woman, one needed a strong resolve. In this sense, not being an evil ruler wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing.", "\u201cWhew\u2026\u201d", "Charlotte Aria sighed once again before looking around. The grand hall of the palace was quiet and lonely.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Thinking about it now, other than Jung Sua and Sorg K\u00fchne, she had no one else. No one tried to approach her, nor did they ask anything of her. To be precise, there was one more person, but that person always left her very exhausted.", "In the end, she stayed cooped up in the palace every day.", "Thinking this way, an indescribable sense of emptiness and loneliness crept up inside her.", "She had already sent Jung Sua off after consoling her and had sent Sorg K\u00fchne out after yelling at him. She wanted to vent her frustration at someone, to get her pitiful situation off her chest and be consoled.", "After wandering around the grand hall meaninglessly, Charlotte Aria walked to her bedroom hastily.", "\u201cDamn it, where did I put it?\u201d", "After rummaging through her room for a long time, she found the item she was looking for\u2014 a communication crystal.", "Hesitation flickered in her eyes as she saw the crystal, but she soon steeled her resolve and sat down at the edge of her bed.", "Wavering slightly, she placed her hand on the crystal ball. While she never put in any effort to train, a royalty was still a royalty. Moreover, Charlotte Aria was the direct descendant of the Thunder Monarch and the Aria family, known for their mastery in magic.", "She at least had the ability to activate a communication crystal. Though, it was really the most basic of skills.", "As she stared at the flickering crystal with worry, a clear light suddenly flashed. After seeing the person reflected in the crystal, Charlotte Aria\u2019s complexion brightened.", "\u201cUn-Unni\u2026.\u201d", "\u2014Oh? What\u2019s gotten into our crybaby queen to give me a call?", "When a less-than-enthusiastic voice flowed out, Charlotte Aria quickly turned sullen.", "\u201cI\u2019m not a crybaby\u2026\u201d", "\u2014Why did you call?", "\u201cI wanted your advice regarding something\u2026\u201d", "\u2014Advice? Hah, didn\u2019t you speak all high and mighty last time about never calling me again? What happened all of a sudden to make you change your mind?", "The woman twirling her hair and speaking indifferently was none other than Teresa Hussey.", "Eva and Haramark. The two royal families were in close contact since earlier generations and had solidified their friendships.", "Even in the current generation, they had maintained their close relationship by arranging Soel Aria and Olivia Hussey\u2019s marriage, while Charlotte Aria and Teresa Hussey also developed their relationship into that of a younger and older sister by having known each other from a young age.", "That was, until the war broke out.", "At first, Teresa did her best to understand Charlotte Aria. This non-blood related younger sister of hers was only four years old when the Parasites appeared, and the Empire that she had trusted so much in, fell when she was only eight.", "Since she lost her parents at such a young age and was forced to escape for her life, it was understandable how that would have been a traumatic experience for her.", "But all matters had a bottom line.", "Would reality change if you lament your misfortunes and stayed drowning in sorrows? No!", "Teresa realized this early on. As such, she used the Royal Oath to receive the same power as the Earthlings and jumped into the battlefield.", "Looking back, she was so busy that having even ten of her wouldn\u2019t have been enough. She already had her hands full with fighting the Parasites, dealing with the Earthlings, and taking care of government affairs.", "In her busy schedule, Charlotte Aria, who constantly complained and cried to her, was a huge source of stress. Even after time passed and she ascended to the throne, she\u2019d say, \u201cUnni~ Unni~\u201d and try to rely on her like a kid. Naturally, Teresa went beyond being annoyed with her, growing tired of her as a person.", "In the end, Teresa blew up. The two had a huge fight before they cut off their relationship.", "The two of them had not talked since then. At least, until Charlotte Aria contacted her today.", "\u2014If you\u2019re trying to treat me like your emotional outlet, I\u2019ll have to refuse.", "\u201cEmotional outlet?\u201d", "\u2014It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t know. Anyway, I\u2019m hanging up if there\u2019s nothing important.", "\u201cAre you still angry about that\u2026 Ah, Unni!\u201d", "When Teresa really tried to hang up, Charlotte Aria shouted hurriedly.", "\u201cThis time, it\u2019s a really important matter!\u201d", "\u2014Well, good luck. Don\u2019t you think I know that you\u2019re just going to say things are hard for you?", "\u201cThat\u2019s not it! Um, who was it again\u2026 Seol\u2026. It\u2019s about the Earthling who is Carpe Diem\u2019s leader!\u201d", "\u2014Hmm?", "Teresa widened her eyes in surprise.", "\u2014Oh, my Seol?", "\u201cMy?\u201d", "\u2014Aren\u2019t you talking about Mister Seol Jihu? He\u2019s not Carpe Diem\u2019s leader, but Valhalla\u2019s representative.", "\u201cY-Yeah?\u201d", "\u2014This is a surprise. I didn\u2019t think my dear\u2019s name would come out of your mouth.", "Charlotte Aria was a little surprised to hear the words, \u2018my dear\u2019, but she quickly continued seeing that Teresa had the intention of hearing her out a bit.", "\u201cThe palace has been in an uproar recently. That Earthling named Seol Jihu apparently\u2014\u201d", "\u2014Really? Then kick him out.", "Teresa cut her off before she even finished.", "\u201cH-Huh?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria was taken aback.", "\u2014What a joke! Do you think I don\u2019t know? I\u2019m hearing and seeing everything. Just what are you unhappy about? He\u2019s cleaned up the leeches existing at the city\u2019s expense and helped the people dying from these leeches. He\u2019s trying every means possible to save the city from destruction, even going as far as to spend his own money. Hah.", "Teresa suddenly snorted.", "\u2014Even kowtowing a hundred times would not be enough, and you have the galls to complain just because things are a little noisy?", "\u201cL-Listen to me\u2026\u201d", "\u2014Yeah, no, I don\u2019t want to. Just kick him out. You\u2019re the queen so you should have that authority. Once he\u2019s gone, it will be quiet again. Yep, there\u2019s your solution.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u2014I just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s not just Haramark; Grazia, Nur, Scheherazade, Odor, and Caligo, these six royal families are all dying to invite him to their city. Why is it Eva\u2026? Argh, you don\u2019t even know your luck.", "Teresa said all this extremely quickly. A flustered look flashed across Charlotte Aria\u2019s face. She knew Teresa had changed a lot ever since she began to interact with the Earthlings, but she still wasn\u2019t used to this side of her.", "\u2014Oh, try to kick him toward Haramark\u2019s direction if you can. Do you know how many days I spent wetting my pillow with tears when he left? This is great. Give him back. If you chase him out to Haramark, I\u2019ll listen to your complaints for the next 10 years. Really.", "Words shot out of Teresa\u2019s mouth like arrows, and Charlotte Aria didn\u2019t have the time to process it all.", "\u201cUnni, don\u2019t be like this and listen to me. My royal administrator\u2014\u201d", "\u2014Yeah, yeah, expel him too.", "No matter what the queen said, Teresa kept saying the same thing.", "\u2014Arbor Muto is dying from all the work anyway. Every capable person is valuable right now. Sorg K\u00fchne will be of great help. Alright, expel him to Haramark too. You\u2019ll also be happy since you\u2019ll be free from his nagging, and I\u2019ll be happy too. How about it?", "Charlotte Aria opened her mouth dazedly. Of course, she wasn\u2019t a complete fool. She understood what Teresa was trying to say by making such sarcastic remarks.", "\u201cUnni, what about Evangeline\u2019s leader, Jung Sua?\u201d", "When she asked just in case\u2026", "\u2014Are you mad?", "A negative answer immediately came flying back.", "\u2014You hold on to her until the end. Don\u2019t release that shit to some poor city.", "\u201cShit?\u201d", "\u2014It\u2019s not even funny. Don\u2019t you dare pour that bucket of feces and urine anywhere else.", "\u2018Bucket of feces and urine, she says.\u2019 Charlotte Aria was shocked by the degree of insult Teresa flung toward Jung Sua.", "Narrowing her eyes, she glared at the crystal.", "\u201cThat\u2019s going too far. How can you compare someone with feces and urine?\u201d", "\u2014I can say worse things. That bitch ruined the cute, lovable little sister I used to have.", "Charlotte Aria seemed genuinely angry, but she suddenly felt better hearing the words \u2018cute\u2019 and \u2018lovable\u2019.", "\u201cKuhum, that\u2019s because you don\u2019t know her well, Unni. She\u2019s\u2026\u201d", "\u2014Whatever. I know the situation more than well. You don\u2019t need to explain it.", "Teresa said firmly before crossing her arms.", "\u2014Now that I think about it, didn\u2019t we have a similar conversation before?", "When Teresa turned serious, Charlotte Aria nodded carefully.", "\u2014I don\u2019t know what you were expecting when you called me again, but my answer won\u2019t be any different than last time.", "\u201cNo, I just\u2026\u201d", "\u2014I\u2019m tired of consoling you, especially when you don\u2019t give a shit about my genuine advice. I have nothing more to say.", "As Teresa spoke coldly, Charlotte Aria bit her lower lip.", "\u201cYou\u2019re being too harsh!\u201d", "Teresa pressed her forehead and shook her head. But seeing this only angered Charlotte Aria more.", "\u201cYou\u2019re just like the royal administrator, Unni! You never try to understand my feelings! You never listen to me and always, always\u2014\u201d", "\u2014That\u2019s because you make absurd demands.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not absurd!\u201d", "\u2014Stop barking whatever comes out of your mouth and think sensibly. A criminal will always say they\u2019ve been unfairly charged. Which criminal is going to say, \u2018That\u2019s right! I did it!\u2019? But you\u2019re only listening to the criminal and saying, \u2018Ith'sh noth abshurd!\u2019 It\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re driving the royal administrator insane.", "\u201cDon\u2019t mock me! I never said it like that!\u201d", "\u2014Ehew.", "Teresa felt like it was a total waste of her time to even talk to Charlotte Aria, but she still opened her mouth to generously speak her mind.", "\u2014You want me to take a guess? You want to keep that bucket of feces and urine and have it stay with you, right?", "\u201cDon\u2019t call her that! She has a name!\u201d", "Charlotte Aria shouted in fury. Regardless, Teresa continued.", "\u2014You don\u2019t care whether that bucket of shit is in the right or wrong. You\u2019re shutting your ears and eyes off and closing your mouth because you don\u2019t want to believe it.", "The fuming Charlotte Aria flinched slightly.", "\u2014\u2019But Queen~ I didn\u2019t do anything wrong~\u2019 You\u2019re shaken by these utter nonsense of words when all the evidence says otherwise.", "\u201cHmph\u2026 so what, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s all my fault? I\u2019m the queen, but I should just do whatever Sorg K\u00fchne says?\u201d", "\u2014Oh please, you don\u2019t know what being a queen is.", "Teresa dropped her head. She heaved a deep sigh that was clearly meant for Charlotte Aria to hear. Then, she smacked her lips.", "\u2014What\u2019s the point in me saying anything? You\u2019re only going to pick up what you want to hear and see anyway.", "\u201cAgain! Again!\u201d", "\u2014I\u2019m sure the late king is tossing and lamenting in his grave. Same for Brother Soel and Campbell. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "At that moment, Charlotte Aria\u2019s expression changed. She hated being compared to her family the most.", "\u201cKeuk!\u201d", "She wanted to retort, but she didn\u2019t know what to say. Her face reddened in an instant as a light flickered past Teresa\u2019s eyes.", "\u2014Why? Am I wrong?", "\u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d", "\u2014Then show me.", "Charlotte Aria frowned.", "\u2014Right, Sorg K\u00fchne isn\u2019t always correct. There might be a misunderstanding like you said.", "\u201cRight! That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d", "\u2014If you want to convince me, or anyone for that matter, at least have some evidence.", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u2014Judge with your own eyes. \u2018I looked into it personally, and this was how it was. I heard about it personally, and that was how it was. So I think it\u2019s better to do this.\u2019 If you reason in this way, do you think Sorg K\u00fchne would still say the same thing? I don\u2019t think so.", "\u201c\u2026What if he still says the same thing?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria asked carefully. Teresa furrowed her brows heavily.", "\u2014Just do it first.", "Paat! The light on the crystal ball flickered off. Teresa had hung up one-sidedly.", "\u201cUnni? Unni!\u201d", "Charlotte Aria quickly grabbed the communication crystal. She poured her mana into it again, but the call did not connect.", "Teresa was obviously not picking up on purpose.", "\u201cWuuuuuuuu!\u201d", "Vexed that she was not able to properly speak her thoughts, Charlotte Aria fell on her bed and rolled around. She threw a tantrum by herself and tried to calm her anger, but Teresa\u2019s words kept bugging her.", "She remembered the saying, three men can speak a tiger into existence. Even a lie would seem real if enough people said it.", "Not to mention Sorg K\u00fchne, who had been with her for a long time, with even Teresa, who used to be like her elder sister, saying the same thing, Charlotte Aria had complex feelings.", "On the other hand, a small bulb of curiosity began to grow inside her.", "\u2018My dear?\u2019", "Though a digression, Teresa was very, very picky when it came to picking a potential partner. Even the two elder brothers, whom Charlotte Aria admired to death, were only evaluated as \u2018so-so\u2019.", "Although it was a memory from when she was a child, whenever the two of them were alone, Teresa would often tell her that she would choose her own marriage partner and that she would rather run away than go through a political marriage.", "Capable, renowned, hot-bodied, heroic, kind, handsome, and thoughtful. If even one of these were missing, Teresa said she would not marry even if a knife was held to her neck.", "Furthermore, this Earthling was supposedly wanted by the other six royal families\u2026", "\u2018I think I heard the rumors before\u2026\u2019", "In any case, with what Teresa said about this Earthling named Seol Jihu, Charlotte Aria couldn\u2019t help but get a little curious.", "[Just do it first.]", "\u201c\u2026Hmph.\u201d", "Recalling Teresa, the defiance she managed to quench shot up again, making Charlotte Aria pout.", "\u2018You think I can\u2019t!? Fine, I\u2019ll judge with my own eyes!\u2019", "Half in defiance and half out of curiosity, Charlotte Aria steeled her resolve and raised her body. Then, she suddenly remembered something and fell into thought.", "\u2018Wait, if I talk to Sorg K\u00fchne before going, he might try to show only his good sides\u2026.\u2019", "A person\u2019s true character was only revealed when they were bare naked. Suddenly, she had the thought, \u2018Should I go secretly?\u2019", "Soon, the hesitating Charlotte Aria must have come to a decision as the corner of her mouth stealthily curled up.", "She now had something to do.", "For some reason, she was starting to have fun.", "*", "Tak. Seol Jihu let out a long sigh after flipping through the last page of the document.", "The report that Yun Seohui left behind as a present. As thick as it was, a tremendous amount of information was written inside it.", "Starting from Charlotte Aria\u2019s life to the process of Jung Sua becoming her aid, it recorded everything in-depth.", "Seol Jihu could only be surprised at how Sinyoung managed to find out about matters from tens of years ago.", "In any case, there was a lot written in the report.", "\u2018But if I were to summarize Charlotte Aria in one sentence\u2026\u2019", "The report was basically saying this.", "\u2014Eva\u2019s queen is a goddamn buffoon.", "And if he were to add another sentence\u2026", "\u2014It\u2019s a mystery how such a moronic brat could come out when the first and second son were both outstanding.", "Seol Jihu was not exaggerating. This was really the overarching tone of the report.", "He could tell that whoever wrote this report was dumbfounded enough to mix in a little bit of their personal thoughts.", "\u2018If Eva\u2019s ruler wasn\u2019t Charlotte Aria, but someone like the late king\u2026\u2019", "According to the report, Charlotte Aria\u2019s father was a powerful magician titled the Thunder Monarch.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but think how nice it would have been if this late king was alive like King Prihi.", "\u2018It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand her plight since she experienced war from a young age\u2026\u2019", "But staying at the same spot for more than ten years was going overboard.", "It was simple. There were people like Teresa Hussey who chose to face reality and unsheath their swords, but there were also people like Charlotte Aria who chose to avoid reality.", "After all, even royals were fundamentally human beings.", "It wasn\u2019t just Charlotte Aria.", "\u2018Kim Hannah\u2019s right.\u2019", "After reading about Jung Sua, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. She was neither skilled in battle nor administratively capable like Kim Hannah.", "Persona.", "Just by sticking to certain personas, she had climbed up to her current position. Of course, Charlotte Aria being so vulnerable played a big role, but being able to grab that opportunity was a skill in itself.", "It was then. As Seol Jihu was lost in thought, his communication crystal shone.", "The caller was Teresa Hussey.", "\u201cPrincess?\u201d", "\u2014Fufu, have you been well?", "\u2018What is she calling me about?\u2019", "Seol Jihu suppressed the faint worry in his heart and asked. Then, as soon as he heard Teresa\u2019s explanation, his eyes widened.", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u2014I\u2019d give it about a 70 to 80 percent chance. Today at the earliest, tomorrow at the latest.", "Teresa shrugged.", "\u2014That\u2019s just how she is. She has a bit of an inferiority complex. Well, I brought up her family and said some harsh things, but even then, she only has a chance of acting.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u2014Be honest. It\u2019s been upsetting, right?", "Teresa covered her mouth and laughed.", "\u2014I understand. She really doesn\u2019t know how to differentiate between feces and urine.", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly. He would be lying if he said he never once felt upset.", "From the Eva Royal Family\u2019s perspective, Seol Jihu was an Earthling who had made great contributions. Although he didn\u2019t do this with the intention of receiving rewards, he felt a bit dejected when he heard that the queen was siding with Jung Sua.", "\u2014But she\u2019s not a bad child by nature. Just a little lacking is all. But once she trusts someone, she becomes the Giving Tree. Depending on how you treat her, she can become the most unconditional ally.", "Not excellent, not devoted, but an unconditional ally.", "Seol Jihu decided to take this meaningful advice to heart.", "\u2014Anyway, try to grab hold of this chance. With your charms, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to capture her.", "Seol Jihu stared at Teresa with a renewed look. At first, he thought she called him to nag about not calling enough.", "\u2014Ah, my apologies if I shouldn\u2019t have meddled. It was just frustrating seeing the progress halted with just a few steps left to go\u2026", "But she wasn\u2019t trying to henpeck him. If anything, she was pecking at his itchy spots when he hadn\u2019t even told her about it.", "\u201cNot at all. I was frustrated with it as well. Excellent assist, Princess.\u201d", "Her wifely support was on par with Seo Yuhui and Flone.", "\u2018Wait, Yun Seohui too?\u2019", "The report on the desk caught his eyes, but then he shook his head and shook off the silly thought.", "After expressing a deep thanks to Teresa, Seol Jihu got up. As this matter could be a turning point in the status quo, he planned to discuss it with Kim Hannah.", "*", "As always, hundreds of people were gathered in front of Valhalla\u2019s building. It was to pick up the freely distributed food.", "Since the Eva Alliance collapsed, there was no need to continue the plan any longer. But because quitting right away seemed too obvious, Kim Hannah suggested a grace period of two weeks, and Seol Jihu accepted it right away.", "There was a saying that people would confuse goodwill for privilege if it went on for too long, but Eva\u2019s residents were not like that. In fact, their gratitude only strengthened by the day.", "It was because Valhalla seized the debts owed to the Eva Alliance under the guise of damage compensation and re-contracted the people with reasonable conditions.", "Kim Hannah had taken care of this matter so that no problem would arise in the future. As a result, Eva\u2019s residents were starting to think of Valhalla not only as the actual royal partner, but also as the organization representing all of Eva.", "Just like always, Kim Hannah was overseeing the free food distribution site today.", "Seol Jihu discovered her from afar and walked up.", "\u201cKim Hannah!\u201d", "\u201cHmm? Why are you here?\u201d", "\u201cI needed to tell you something urgently.\u201d", "Kim Hannah turned around with a confused look. Then, she furrowed her brows.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d", "\u201cNo, I understand. So is she going to summon us or visit us officially? Or\u2014\u201d", "After turning around reflexively\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Kim Hannah shut her mouth, unable to finish her sentence. As she stared intently in one spot, her eyes opened wide.", "It couldn\u2019t be helped. Although the hundreds of civilians that had gathered around made the view crowded, there was one person from her appearance and clothes who stood out starkly among the ordinary residents.", "She was surely thinking that she was well-hidden and disguised, but such a shabby disguise could not trick Kim Hannah\u2019s well-practiced eyes.", "It would be a different story if Kim Hannah never discovered her, but now that she did, she couldn\u2019t help but pay attention carefully.", "Speaking of the devil, the Queen of Eva had come personally. And judging by how she was alone, she seemed to have left secretly.", "She stared doubtfully for only a moment. Once she remembered what Seol Jihu told her\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201d", "Kim Hannah instantly lowered her gaze. Her brain spun as she continued in a quiet voice.", "\u201cListen carefully to what I am about to say.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes flashed cunningly, like the eyes of a fox in front of a herbivore."]}
