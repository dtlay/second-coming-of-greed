The Charlotte Aria, known for being a sucker and a fool, had the aptitude to become a Magician which only the extreme minority of Earthlings could become?", "It was somewhat hard to believe.", "\u201cIt looks like you have a minor misunderstanding.\u201d", "Roselle smiled brightly.", "\u201cBeing talented does not mean being smart or intelligent. It also has nothing to do with how they normally act.\u201d", "Seol Jihu flinched, his inner thoughts having been read, but he accepted it quickly. He remembered that Roselle had the ability to read other people\u2019s thoughts.", "\u201cTalent refers to the natural aptitude and ability needed to accomplish a certain task. Substituting this definition directly, the aptitude and ability needed to become a Magician is simply mana.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head without realizing it. Thinking about it now, even for Earthlings, the first condition necessary to become a Magician was mana level.", "\u201cMana, by nature, is largely innate. Of course, there are exceptions, and I certainly don\u2019t mean to ridicule the hard-working people who built up their foundation over their lifetime. It\u2019s just that bloodline plays a huge role in determining one\u2019s mana.\u201d", "Meaning, Charlotte Aria was a natural talent.", "In truth, Seol Jihu was somewhat similar. Although his innately high mana did not have anything to do with his bloodline, he had been subconsciously training his mana from a very young age due to the Nine Eyes that he was born with. He would definitely be one of the exceptions Roselle mentioned.", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201cI\u2019m still not sure I get it. I understand that she has talent\u2026 but if her mana is so great, then why wasn\u2019t she trained from a young age?\u201d", "\u201cYour question stems from your lack of knowledge about Paradise.\u201d", "Roselle replied firmly.", "\u201cParadise is a strictly patriarchal society. Even for a woman of high social standing, the only difference is how they are used, and their fundamental societal expectation does not change. Even the youngest daughter of a royal family will only be raised as a political tool to be used for the nation\u2019s benefit.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWhen they grow up, they will most certainly be sold off. Naturally, royal families do not want their hostages to know magic.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cPolitical marriages are simply an exchange of collaterals. The daughters-in-law should be obedient and not cause any trouble. So what would the royal or noble families think if their hostages had a mysterious power like magic? They would be anxious, especially if that hostage comes from the Aria family.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was lost for words.

I must have subconsciously set the standard too high because I thought I needed to search for a Magician capable of inheriting the Eternal Light of Wisdom.\u201d", "\u201cAh, you have a point.\u201d", "Roselle smiled happily as Seol Jihu subtly praised the accomplishment she made in her later years.", "\u201cBut don\u2019t worry! An excellent master has no deficient disciples!\u201d", "Roselle praised herself before stealthily glancing at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cBut since there is a chance that she might not be the most suitable candidate\u2026 I would greatly appreciate it if you could introduce a few more talented children\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu narrowed his eyes.

Roselle put her right hand over her heart and spread her left hand out before continuing grandly.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m constantly praising myself, but this dream world I manifested through great effort is the best environment to research the discipline of sorcery. You can create whatever you imagine, so even a complete beginner can train easily and have fun at the same time.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "It was then that Seol Jihu realized what a great fortune he was holding on to.", "No, he already knew. It was just that he had not thought it would be this great.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. Okay, I can try talking to the queen.\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d", "Roselle shook her head.", "\u201cI appreciate your offer, but I only requested Seol Jihu-nim to find potential candidates.

Then what should I do for you?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked while fiddling with his pendant. Roselle smiled like a mischievous child.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing difficult.\u201d", "She neared Seol Jihu\u2019s ear and whispered in a quiet voice.", "*", "Chak.

Pyak!\u201d", "As he was lost in a daze, a loud chirp woke him up. Seol Jihu looked down only to see a furious little chick.", "The way it flapped its little wings with its tiny bean-sized eyes wide open, it almost looked like it was protesting begrudgingly. This was because it was sleeping soundly on Seol Jihu\u2019s forehead before he suddenly shot up and caused the chick to fall.", "\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d", "\u201cPiaaaaa!\u201d", "Seol Jihu apologized, but Little Chick's anger didn\u2019t show any sign of calming down.", "\u201cIf you keep screaming, you\u2019re going to get hoarse, little guy.\u201d", "Not even a month has passed since it was born, so what was it screaming so loudly for?

Since this was no longer the case, the plan obviously had to change.", "Even if he still followed the plan, he had to at least let her know what happened. Seol Jihu knocked twice out of courtesy before opening the door.", "Seeing Kim Hannah sound asleep, he thumped the bed violently.", "\u201cKim Hannah! Kim Hannah!\u201d", "Thumping the mattress again and again, he urged her to wake up.", "\u201c!?\u201d", "Struck by an earthquake in the middle of the night, Kim Hannah floundered like an octopus, scared out of her senses.

That was when they would meet the queen for lunch.", "\u201cSay it.\u201d", "Kim Hannah fixed her posture.", "\u201cKim Hannah, it would be great if someone with an established position in Paradise awakened as a Magician and became a reliable ally, right?

Kim Hannah blinked quickly before dropping her head.", "\u201cJihu\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYeah?\u201d", "\u201cI was wondering what was so urgent\u2026 Didn\u2019t I tell you before? That Magicians are like the stars in the night sky.\u201d", "She continued with a deep sigh.", "\u201cIn Paradise, the Magician class is kind of like a free pass. Do you remember the organization registration process? If Carpe Diem had a Magician, we wouldn\u2019t have needed to prepare so many things. Without a huge disqualifying reason, any city would have given the OK. Why? Because we would have a Magician.\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked up helplessly.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right, having a Magician like that would be greatly appreciated.

That stupid brat has the talent to become a Magician?\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t believe it either, right? I was the same.

In Paradise, the value of a Magician did not need to be said.", "But this matter wasn\u2019t about an already precious Magician, but a totally new class called Sorcerer? This Sorcerer could potentially be the queen of a city and a reliable partner? And this queen wasn\u2019t meticulous like Teresa Hussey, but a complete pushover who threw herself at anyone who was kind to her?", "If Seol Jihu was telling the truth, coming to Eva wouldn\u2019t have just been the best choice, but also the greatest.", "Comparing this situation to a game of Poker, it was like cold-calling a four-bet with a subpar pocket pair and ending up with quads!", "It was just too good to be true, even making her doubtful.", "But it was unlikely that Seol Jihu had come all this way in the middle of the night to spout some nonsense.

Compared to them, Eva is in a much better situation.\u201d", "Normally, Charlotte Aria would have breathed a sigh of relief and said, \u2018I see. I thought so.\u2019", "But after seeing and hearing for herself, her thoughts had changed.
