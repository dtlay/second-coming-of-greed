{"cid": "262", "title": "Chapter 262. To Lead (2)", "content": ["\u201c\u2026I have a question.\u201d", "After a long silence, Seol Jihu opened his mouth with his eyes still closed.", "\u201cWhen did you decide to do this?\u201d", "\u201cWhen you accepted the royal family\u2019s mission on your own and ordered everyone to start packing.\u201d", "Kim Hannah replied in a quiet voice. The word \u2018ordered\u2019 dug into Seol Jihu\u2019s conscience, making him bite his lower lip.", "\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t decided on the spot and asked for everyone\u2019s opinion\u2026.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smacked her lips.", "\u201cAs I said before, you\u2019re not a simple member, but a leader. You have the final say on any matter \u2014 big or small \u2014 that arises in the organization. That\u2019s what it means to be the representative of an organization.\u201d", "Meaning, leaving the minor aspects aside, accepting the royal family\u2019s mission was not a bad thing.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d", "The problem was the way he carried out his authority.", "\u201cI hoped you would at least keep the procedure of holding a meeting.\u201d", "But Seol Jihu had not done so. He had ordered his comrades one-sidedly after accepting the royal family\u2019s mission.", "Normally, this would not have been a problem. But considering Carpe Diem\u2019s situation at the time, he should have discussed it beforehand.", "\u201cA meeting is a gathering of people to discuss various matters. Even if you already accepted the royal family\u2019s mission and decided on going, that\u2019s where I have the authority to officially voice my opinion. In front of everyone.\u201d", "Although she explained in a roundabout way, she was saying that she would have explained the plan to Seol Jihu if he had held a meeting.", "Seol Jihu sighed. He knew Kim Hannah wasn\u2019t doing this just because of what he did on their first night here. Because she had already taken a step back at the cafeteria, her pent-up frustration must have burst out at the end.", "In truth, Seol Jihu still did not regret what he did on the first night.", "Gula had approved him, the egg encouraged him, and he himself thought that it was something that must be done.", "His thoughts still hadn\u2019t changed.", "And that was the problem.", "Not every Earthling in Paradise was Seol Jihu. Everyone had their own desires and wishes. He should not have forced his beliefs onto others just because his actions were righteous.", "Seol Jihu had thought, \u2018You could have at least told me about the plan.\u2019 But the same applied to Seol Jihu.", "[\u2026The main point is that it would have been nice if you called me on the communication crystal before and just let me know. That way, I would have been able to prepare for the coming day and perhaps even assist you. As your friend and as your partner.]", "He should have mulled over Hao Win\u2019s words more carefully. In fact, he should have first thought about his comrades, who trust him so much.", "He would not have needed to convince them anyway. The least he could have done was explain what he was planning to do.", "It was just like what Kim Hannah said.", "What was on everyone\u2019s minds as they followed him that first night?Swapping the roles, how would he have felt if he were in their shoes?", "All sorts of thoughts flitted through his mind.", "And soon\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d", "Within the icy silence\u2026", "\u201cI think I made a mistake.\u201d", "Seol Jihu opened his eyes.", "*", "Following Carpe Diem\u2019s return after successfully completing the royal family\u2019s mission, a meeting was held.", "It wasn\u2019t for any particular reason, and there wasn\u2019t a pressing issue that needed to be discussed either. That said, things weren\u2019t fully resolved either, so it was too early to raise a toast and celebrate.", "Because Kim Hannah pointing out Seol Jihu\u2019s improper procedures meant what she had done was wrong as well.", "Moreover, Seol Jihu and Kim Hannah had different positions.", "Although they had done the same thing, Seol Jihu at least had justification as the leader. Strictly speaking, an ordinary member like Kim Hannah could not be placed on the same level as the representative of an organization.", "Even if they both were in the wrong, the reality of Paradise was that she needed to be punished harsher than Seol Jihu.", "As a result, the air in the meeting room was as cold as ice and as heavy as a rock.", "The team members generally had pale complexions. Chohong, especially, was glaring at Kim Hannah openly, while Hugo\u2019s facial muscles were also wriggling.", "Jang Maldong showed signs of discomfort as well. Although he had agreed to Kim Hannah\u2019s plan, that was because Kim Hannah mentioned being given the authority to act as a proxy leader. It certainly wasn\u2019t because he approved of her actions. In fact, he had shown his reluctance by leaving the private meeting with Hao Win and Kim Hannah before the meeting was officially adjourned.", "Despite this, no one spoke up.", "There were three reasons \u2014 Carpe Diem made great gains with Kim Hannah\u2019s plan, everyone knew she didn\u2019t do so out of ill intentions, and they remembered what she proclaimed during the welcoming party, being the proxy leader in times of emergency.", "In truth, this was the sole justification that could defend what Kim Hannah had done.", "While everyone was keeping their thoughts to themselves, Seol Jihu slowly spoke up.", "\u201cAfter coming to Eva\u2026\u201d", "As he began to talk, ten pairs of eyes fell on him.", "\u201cWe went through a lot in a short time, huh.\u201d", "A few people laughed. Just as Seol Jihu said, no one expected things to turn out like this right after moving to Eva.", "\u201cIt\u2019s great if we\u2019re just looking at the results. The Eva Alliance was destroyed, and Carpe Diem practically suffered zero damage.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke calmly.", "\u201cI want to say well done, but things aren\u2019t over yet. Plus\u2026\u201d", "He hesitated for a moment before continuing.", "\u201cBefore we take the next step, there\u2019s something we need to discuss.\u201d", "Chohong furrowed her brows. Looking at Seol Jihu, she shook her head hastily, signaling him to not speak any further.", "It wasn\u2019t that Seol Jihu didn\u2019t catch her signal. But in this world, there was no such thing as a perfect human being. There were only people who were trying to perfect their flaws.", "But to do so, one needed to acknowledge their flaws first. Only then would they be able to take the first step toward growth.", "Even when facing one\u2019s flaw directly, there was no guarantee it would be fixed. And so, covering or avoiding it was obviously a no-go.", "Knowing this, Seol Jihu no longer hesitated and said.", "\u201cTo everyone here, the war against the Eva Alliance must have been a little, no, very sudden.\u201d", "Maria and Phi Sora nodded their heads.", "\u201cI really want to thank everyone for following me even when I was so stubborn. And I\u2019m sorry as well.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled faintly.", "\u201cFrom now on, I will share my thoughts more and hear everyone\u2019s opinions.\u201d", "He sounded as if a huge burden had been lifted off his chest. After he came to terms with his mistake, he had been feeling more lighthearted.", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to tell everyone.\u201d", "Seol Jihu ended his talk with that.", "When apologizing for a mistake, one should not be overly dignified, but one should also not lower oneself more than necessary either.", "Seol Jihu thanked everyone for their support in the recent events and by mentioning that he had skipped the proper procedures, he admitted his mistake as well.", "Jang Maldong gently closed his eyes.", "Meanwhile, Chohong gritted her teeth and glared at Kim Hannah. To her, it looked like Seol Jihu was humiliated because of Kim Hannah. Just as she was about to say something, unable to hold in her anger\u2014", "\u201cNot at all.\u201d", "A calm, quiet voice rang out in the meeting room. Marcel Ghionea had unexpectedly spoken up. He had his hand raised, seemingly asking for permission to speak, so Seol Jihu nodded his head.", "\u201cAs you said, the first night was a surprise. It felt like it came out of nowhere. Of course, I understood when I saw the VIP auction house.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea lowered his hand and continued.", "\u201cWhen I joined this team, I discussed many things with Leader. Among them was the direction he wanted to take Carpe Diem.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. What Marcel Ghionea said wasn\u2019t wrong, but he couldn\u2019t figure out why he brought this up.", "\u201cUltimately, Leader and I have different goals, but we certainly have coinciding steps as well. That was the deciding factor that made me join this team. Well, it was also part of the requirements.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea cleared his throat.", "\u201cSo I understand Leader\u2019s actions and support them.\u201d", "Only now did Seol Jihu realize that Marcel Ghionea wasn\u2019t talking to him.", "\u201cLeader, you said there was something you needed to discuss before you take the next step.\u201d", "That was because his cold gaze turned to Kim Hannah.", "\u201cI apologize, but I believe there are two things to be discussed. Of course, this second matter might have been included in the first thing you wanted to discuss, but I feel it needs to be said first.\u201d", "His grey eyes which resembled a wild wolf\u2019s stared at Kim Hannah as if to prey on her.", "\u201cBefore that, there\u2019s something I want to ask. Miss Kim Hannah was given the authority to act as the proxy leader, but wasn\u2019t that only in times of emergency?\u201d", "It was finally here.", "The eyes that had gathered on Seol Jihu all turned to Kim Hannah. Most of them were critical of her, but Kim Hannah didn\u2019t bat an eye.", "In fact, she accepted the looks willfully.", "\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d", "\u201cIn times of emergency means exactly that \u2014 an unexpected situation. The dictionary meaning, I mean.\u201d", "As soon as Kim Hannah acknowledged it, Marcel Ghionea pounced on the opportunity to attack.", "\u201cI believe it\u2019s misleading to call this matter an emergency when the event was both expected and prepared for.\u201d", "His voice even carried a little bit of hostility.", "\u201cFor example, the ghost lady. From what I hear, Miss Kim Hannah predicted the attack and borrowed the pendant. Even without this piece of evidence, we can be sure of her knowledge regarding the matter by knowing the deal she made with the Triads.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. The backlash was stronger than she imagined.", "But she had already prepared herself for the worst. Whether it be an organization or a team, hierarchies existed and had to exist.", "While Carpe Diem\u2019s hierarchical structure looked very loose and free, it was a different story when Seol Jihu was involved.", "No matter the organization, an incompetent leader was criticized and a competent leader was trusted. As a rather close-minded team, this was even more evident in Carpe Diem.", "One could see this just by observing how no one voiced any complaints even though Seol Jihu had frequently skipped the proper procedures after coming to Eva.", "\u201cMiss Kim Hannah clearly expected and prepared for this situation. How can anyone call this an emergency in good conscience?\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea was a good example of this as well. The reason he ignored countless offers from various teams and organizations and joined Carpe Diem was to repay the debt he owed to Seol Jihu for saving his life. And the reason he chose to follow Seol Jihu was that he had faith that Seol Jihu would be the one to grant his deepest desire.", "After the war, this faith only grew stronger.", "\u201cAt least, I can\u2019t.\u201d", "To Marcel Ghionea, who had a sense of indebtedness and high expectations from Seol Jihu, what Kim Hannah pointed out was only a \u2018minor\u2019 mistake.", "In the end, it was a matter of perspective.", "Birds of a feather flock together; like attracts like.", "While some people empathized with Kim Hannah\u2019s intentions, there were others who were angry and only saw her actions as overstepping of her authority.", "Marcel Ghionea was clearly one of the latter.", "As someone known for his loyalty and single-mindedness, there was no way he would let anyone walk over the person he looked up to. Not unless the fault was 10:0.", "No matter the intention, what Kim Hannah did was wrong and could certainly be seen as her trying to boss Seol Jihu around.", "\u201cTo summarize again, as Carpe Diem had been fully prepared for the recent incident, it cannot be deemed an emergency.\u201d", "Thus, the Archer of Steel aimed at the Fox.", "\u201cAnd I formally raise the notion that what she did should be considered an abuse of power.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled bitterly. She had expected this to happen ever since she revealed her plan to Jang Maldong and Hao Win.", "Seol Jihu was a competent leader. Since Kim Hannah undermined the person who had the utmost trust of the team, she now had to pay the price.", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "She could object if she wanted to. The phrase \u2018in times of emergency\u2019 could be interpreted in a broader sense, and in preparation for this very talk, she had specifically borrowed the pendant for a \u2018just in case\u2019 situation.", "\u201cI agree.\u201d", "However, Kim Hannah chose to accept the charge. Although she could wiggle herself out of this if she wanted, she knew that doing so would turn at least half the people in the room into her enemy.", "This was easy to see. As the most recent addition to the team, she didn\u2019t share any deep bonds with anyone on the team. Unless she held gravitas that rivaled Jang Maldong\u2019s, she wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid criticism for trying to baby Seol Jihu, even if it was in good intention.", "If she objected here, others would start to look for opportunities to get back at her. Most of the people in this room would become founding members of the organization. Getting on their bad side would only make things more difficult for her.", "As she carried the lofty ambition of making Carpe Diem the greatest organization in Paradise, a punishment was needed for her to hold onto her position and reinforce it in the future.", "That was why she asked for the punishment of her own accord.", "\u201cI\u2019m sincerely sorry that this matter troubled everyone.\u201d", "Kim Hannah bowed politely. Then, she raised her head and continued.", "\u201cIn regard to this matter, I talked with Leader before this meeting, and he has decided to take away a part of my authority to prevent the same thing from happening again.\u201d", "\u201cA part, you say\u2026\u201d", "Everyone turned to the head of the table again.", "Seol Jihu sighed internally. Truthfully, he didn\u2019t really want to punish Kim Hannah. Knowing that she shined gold, he didn\u2019t doubt her intention at all.", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t a superhuman. Even though he would become the representative of an organization soon, there were still a ton of things he didn\u2019t know.", "Babying him like Seo Yuhui often did wasn\u2019t right. Unless there was someone to say harsh words and correct mistakes, a child would grow up without knowing right and wrong.", "It was essential to have an advisor who would put on the brakes when necessary.", "However, Kim Hannah had refused vehemently.", "Her crossing the line was an undeniable truth. If Seol Jihu said, \u2018I made a mistake, and Miss Kim Hannah did this with goodwill, so let\u2019s forgive her,\u2019 this would be a terrible precedent that could negatively affect his future organization.", "He couldn\u2019t show biases by pardoning one person and not pardoning another. An organization\u2019s representative had to be impartial.", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "In the end, Seol Jihu took a deep breath before opening his mouth.", "\u201cI will take away Kim Hannah\u2019s authority to act as a proxy leader in times of emergency. Until further notice, administrative work will be her main focus.\u201d", "He revealed the content of her punishment clearly.", "Marcel Ghionea\u2019s eyes flickered with light. To put this decision into words, she had been pulled down from the position of a queen to the position of an administrator. Although she could still advise the leader directly, there was a big difference in that she could not act as his regent.", "\u201cYes, understood.\u201d", "With this decision, the previous incident should not happen again, and Marcel Ghionea was satisfied with it as well.", "Of course, the more hot-headed members wouldn\u2019t be content until she was either chased out of the team or forced to kowtow, but most seemed to accept this decision.", "In any case, they had to consider the fact that her plan swept the Eva Alliance away, and Kim Hannah was too talented to be chased out for something like this.", "\u201cThat\u2019s an appropriate punishment.\u201d", "Jang Maldong, who had been sitting quietly until now, broke his silence. He took a brief pause before continuing.", "\u201cI agree with this punishment since it will prevent the same thing from happening again. Ah, we should probably contact the Triads as well.\u201d", "He spoke as if he just thought about it, but both Kim Hannah and Seol Jihu knew he changed the topic on purpose. Now that this matter had come to a resolution, dwelling on it any further would only make everyone more exhausted.", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took Jang Maldong\u2019s help right away.", "\u201cI plan to contact them as soon as the meeting ends.\u201d", "The Triads had helped them greatly in this last incident. Although the plan was a dazzling success, it wasn\u2019t as if they didn\u2019t suffer any loss of life. Since they acted as Carpe Diem\u2019s shield, it was only right that Carpe Diem thanked them.", "\u201cMm.\u201d", "As the heavy atmosphere lightened slightly, Jang Maldong nodded his head and looked back.", "\u201cAlright, then now\u2026 hmm?\u201d", "Just as he was about to say something, his eyes suddenly opened wide. He blinked rapidly, furrowed his brows, and stared straight at the other side.", "\u201cW-What, what is that thing?\u201d", "When Jang Maldong muttered in shock, everyone reflexively turned their gazes. Next, everyone doubted their eyes.", "\u201c\u2026Egg? Isn\u2019t that the egg from back then?\u201d", "Phi Sora said in shock. Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened as well.", "\u2018When did this little guy get here?\u2019", "He saw the red egg again. There hadn\u2019t been a single meeting it had missed like it was some sort of a drug addict coming to get its dose.", "On top of that, despite being a mere egg, it had taken a seat for itself, lying on the table in front of everyone.", "What was even more startling was that it was wiggling back and forth. It looked like it was putting on an imposing air and nodding its head in approval.", "But it must have felt everyone\u2019s gaze as it suddenly stopped and turned left and right.", "Phi Sora\u2019s jaw dropped.", "\u201cIs it moving? It\u2019s moving by itself, right?\u201d", "A small ruckus erupted. But as if this had nothing to do with it, the egg lied down on the table. Cutting through the table by rolling forward, it stopped in front of Seol Jihu.", "Then, it fixed its posture and stood tall.", "\u201cAh, I was actually going to ask you before.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui asked with a curious expression.", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d", "\u201cAh, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu made a troubled expression as he looked at the egg staring back at him. He answered.", "\u201cAn egg.\u201d", "Thwack!", "The egg immediately jumped up and headbutted Seol Jihu\u2019s stomach. Although it didn\u2019t really hurt, Seol Jihu made a dumbfounded expression.", "\u201cWhat? You are an egg.\u201d", "Thwack! It headbutted again.", "\u201c\u2026You are an egg\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu rubbed his stomach and muttered. Seo Yuhui tilted her head.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s protesting and saying that it\u2019s not an egg. Don\u2019t you have a name for it?\u201d", "Seol Jihu fell into thought. He remembered reading something about a mythical spirit, but he couldn\u2019t really remember it at the top of his head.", "Seeing the egg bouncing up and down in anger, he spoke carefully.", "\u201cBouncy?\u201d", "The egg twitched. Seo Yuhui covered her mouth.", "\u201cOh? What a cute name.\u201d", "\u201cI just made it up. I couldn\u2019t think of its real name\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu trailed off as he saw the color of the egg turn into a deeper red. It even started to convulse noticeably.", "Seo Yuhui blinked.", "\u201c\u2026I think it hates the name.\u201d", "[Yeah, like a young master from the upper society shaking after being humiliated.]", "Flone also chimed in.", "It was then. Tk. The egg suddenly cracked.", "Tk, tk! Tk, tk, tk, tk! After the first crack, it spread like a spiderweb. Before anyone could do anything about it, the cracks spread all over the egg\u2019s surface.", "Everyone including Seol Jihu gasped. A few people even shot up from their seats. No one knew what to do facing this sudden situation.", "Luxuria had mentioned that the egg would test its partner in three stages.", "The first was approving the use of the spear, the second was deciding whether the human was worthy of being its life-long partner, and the third was figuring out whether the partner had the qualification to use the Spear of Purity\u2019s hidden powers.", "Apparently, among the heads of the Rothschear House, most had failed to pass even the first stage.", "\u2018Why?\u2019", "However, Seol Jihu had suddenly passed the second test. That was what the hatching of the egg signified.", "While Seol Jihu was in thought, the cracked upper part of the egg fell. And soon, something popped out of the hole."]}
