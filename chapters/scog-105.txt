Asking for cooperation in the middle of internal conflicts? It was up for interpretation, but it sure sounded like they were asking Carpe Diem to step their feet in the mud.", "However, Kazuki shook his head.", "\u201cNo, things have died down after a huge incident. There is still some veiled enmity and strife for political power\u2026 but it\u2019s more of a rite of passage than a conflict.\u201d", "Jang Maldong\u2019s sharp eyes softened slightly.

Instead, they chose to abolish some of the levels of hierarchy. Of course, they still included their core executives, but it was still an innovative idea at the time.\u201d", "\u201cYes, it wasn\u2019t bad. After all, that is what enabled them to grab hold of powerful authority in Paradise.\u2019", "Difficult talks went back and forth.", "Chohong was yawning as if she was extremely bored, and Hugo was just standing there, completely zoned out.

The culture of the Triads organization was overly competitive. Their innovative idea of getting rid of the existing hierarchy simply came back to bite them.

Knowledge is power.", "Even someone with great physical prowess would easily be taken advantage of if they were stupid.", "As Seol Jihu planned to form his own team in the future, he felt the need to learn to understand these kind of things, so as to be able to survive in Paradise. Of course, he was also curious since the story involved Hao Win.", "\u201cThe leading executives of the Triads knew about this problem, but they failed to control the discord. And because of the prolonged internal strife, they even had to give up the initiative to Sicilia.\u201d", "\u201cAnd the special countermeasure they came up with is this man named Hao Win?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cIf the Triads\u2019 culture hasn\u2019t changed, he will just be treated as another amateur who got in through connections.\u201d", "Kazuki slowly nodded.", "\u201cBut things have gotten better.

So he wants to participate in the Banquet and prove his ability?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s why I said this matter was similar to a rite of passage.\u201d", "\u201cThat man named Hao Win.

Anyways\u2026,\u201d Jang Maldong grinned, seeing Kazuki getting up from the couch. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re starting to think about going independent.\u201d", "Kazuki shut his mouth for a moment, then heaved out a short sigh.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 difficult to go about things alone.

It\u2019s an opportunity that comes around once every two years! I\u2019m going for sure.\u201d Hugo raised his voice, saying they should obviously participate.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026. We only have three people. Let\u2019s just look for an Archer.\u201d But Chohong looked bothered by the whole thing and argued against Hugo.", "\u201cFuck, what, you don\u2019t care anymore now that you\u2019re a High Ranker?\u201d", "\u201cHmph, you going won\u2019t change a thing. I know you\u2019re in a hurry, but do you really think you\u2019ll make it to Stage 3?\u201d", "Chohong and Hugo began to bicker. Jang Maldong stared at them with disappointment before turning around while massaging his temples. Then, he found the young man deep in thought and stared at him fixedly.", "\u2018Oh right\u2026.\u2019", "He remembered Chohong hinting to make Seol Jihu the new leader. Although he planned to appoint the new Archer he would bring in as the leader, there was no reason Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t be the leader either.", "He knew that it was better for someone established in the team to become the leader than someone completely new. Wanting to test Seol Jihu, Jang Maldong threw him a question.", "\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What? Ah, I really don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu jumped in surprise at the sudden question and then shook his head.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine, so tell me.\u201d", "When Jang Maldong pressed him, he took a moment to collect his thoughts, then spoke, \u201cConsidering Carpe Diem\u2019s current position, I think it will be better to participate.\u201d", "\u201cRight?\u201d", "Hugo screamed, thinking Seol Jihu was taking his side.

But by that logic, isn\u2019t it important to absorb new blood into the team as quickly as possible?\u201d", "\u201cBlood can\u2019t be absorbed unconditionally. I don\u2019t think Carpe Diem is a type-O. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s an RH-negative.\u201d", "His analogy piqued Jang Maldong\u2019s interest.", "\u201cThe problem here is, whether an Archer of Dylan\u2019s caliber would be willing to enter this difficult-to-handle team.\u201d", "\u201cSo you\u2019re saying a skilled Archer wouldn\u2019t want to enter the current Carpe Diem?\u201d", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far, but he would certainly weigh his options.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you\u2019re suggesting we come up with something to tip the scale in our favor.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded.", "\u201cYes. From what I heard, this Banquet seems to be a special event that draws in attention from all of Paradise.

He thought that they would just have to fight some monsters and look for treasures, but the scale of the event was far bigger than what he\u2019d imagined.", "Still, he couldn\u2019t figure out why everyone was so worked up about this mysterious festival. It truly was an enigma.", "\u201cTo be honest..\u201d The end of the cane pointed at Seol Jihu. \u201cIt\u2019s way too early for you to participate in the Banquet.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I thought so.\u201d", "\u201cIf you look at the distribution of participants, a vast majority of them are Level 4s.
