Seol Jihu Faithfully Plants Flags Today As Always", "content": ["Seol Jihu dragged his lucky charm, or rather Flone, to the library as soon as he heard her story.

The problem was that every single record cut off after a few pages with the word \u2018REDACTED\u2019.", "Even an idiot would realize that the latter content was deleted. Seol Jihu had checked dozens of history records, including records of unofficial history, yet information regarding this place had been removed without exception.", "It was as if all of Paradise had come together and promised to keep silent.", "But from all the records he read, he was able to gather two pieces of information.", "\u2014The Emperor feared the (REDACTED) attacking the Empire and devised a special measure. That is to erase the (REDACTED)\u2019s existence altogether.", "And.", "\u2014After that day, the Empire and all of its subsidiary countries moved quickly. They arrested anyone who talked about (REDACTED) on the streets and went beyond keeping the secret under wraps to redacting all information regarding it\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026Man.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips after reading just a few lines. He didn\u2019t have a good feeling about this.", "He investigated the Rothschear family\u2019s secrets just in case, and it was just as he thought. He couldn\u2019t find a single record related to the Pagoda of Infection.", "\u2014Rothschear, one of the four duke families who founded the Empire. They serve the Goddess of Chastity.", "\u2014Castitas, the Goddess of Chastity, bestowed the family with the sacred artifact, the Spear of Purity, which housed the elemental spirit, Arcus. The family thus came to be called the Spear of the Empire, and as the name suggests, they always stood at the frontlines of war to combat outside enemies.", "\u2014They are said to be protected by a mythical guardian Phoenix that symbolizes joy.", "Getting confirmation about the Rothschear family\u2019s background and the existence of the Spear of Purity were the only gains.", "Seol Jihu asked Flone about the Pagoda of Infection, but she only said, \u2018Huh? What\u2019s that? I have never heard of it before.\u2019", "The fact that Flone had never heard about it could only mean that the Emperor\u2019s measures had been successful.", "\u2018The Pagoda of Infection.\u2019", "Just its name exuded all sorts of trouble.", "\u2018I doubt it\u2019s talking about a simple contagious disease\u2026\u2019", "There were more than a few suspicious points, but Seol Jihu had no thoughts of reconsidering his plans.", "He had to go.", "This was the opportunity he had been waiting for. If he gave up now, elevating Carpe Diem to an organization would truly become a hopeless dream.", "Though even the Emperor of the ancient Empire had been wary of this place\u2026", "\u2018Let\u2019s face it head on.\u2019", "Seol Jihu walked forward, shaking off his fears.", "**", "After returning to Carpe Diem\u2019s office, Seol Jihu fell into deep thought. Setting aside the matter of conquering the Pagoda of Infection, just getting there was a problem.", "The area in question was similar to the Forest of Denial in that it bordered the Parasites\u2019, the Federation\u2019s, and humanity\u2019s territory.", "Strictly speaking, though, it was closer to the Federation and humanity\u2019s side.", "\u2018I\u2019ll need a Pathfinder for sure\u2026.\u2019", "A Pathfinder was indispensable as he could run into the Parasites at any time. It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t know any Archers, but Marcel Ghionea was poor at scouting and Yi Seol-Ah lacked experience.", "\u2018Warriors\u2026\u2019", "Carpe Diem had a rather strong lineup of Warriors, including himself, Chohong, Phi Sora, and Hugo.", "But that was only in terms of firepower.", "In terms of scale and the size of their party, this trip to the Pagoda of Infection would be an expedition, not an exploration. And Seol Jihu had a strong feeling that simply being good at fighting would not be enough for this expedition.", "This worry stemmed from his lack of information. To be more precise, he still had misgivings in his ability as a leader purely due to his inexperience.", "He wanted an experienced, quick-witted veteran who could control Carpe Diem\u2019s temperamental Warriors in case of an emergency.", "It would be perfect if there was someone as skilled as Dylan. It wasn\u2019t as if he couldn\u2019t think of anyone. But he was hesitating because accepting an outsider\u2019s help would mean he would need to return the favor.", "Seol Jihu knew how incredible the result of this expedition would be, given that it hadn\u2019t fallen into anyone\u2019s hands. So he would be lying if he said he didn\u2019t have any regrets about sharing the loot with outsiders.", "\u2018What should I do?\u2019", "\u201cBOO!\u201d", "While he was deep in thought, a shrill voice struck his ears. When Seol Jihu opened his eyes, he saw Chohong standing in front of him with her mouth open.", "Seol Jihu laughed blandly.", "\u201cHaving fun?\u201d", "\u201cBastard, you\u2019re making me feel embarrassed.\u201d", "Chohong took a step back and grumbled with a flushed face.", "\u201cWhat are you doing here all alone? You had your eyes closed and your arms crossed too.\u201d", "\u201cI think.\u201d", "\u201cThink?\u201d", "\u201cTherefore I exist.\u201d", "\u201cArgh, cut the bullshit.\u201d", "Chohong furrowed her brows.", "\u201cWhy do you have to be like this? You\u2019re such a turn-off sometimes, you know that?\u201d", "She fiddled with her fingers as she criticized him.", "\u201cBut hey, please tell me you were thinking about our next mission. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a scouting mission or an exploration.\u201d", "\u201cYou must be bored.\u201d", "\u201cBored doesn\u2019t even cut it. I\u2019m about to flip from itching all over. Let\u2019s go out, let some fresh air into our nostrils, beat up some monsters and have a change of pace. How about it?\u201d", "Chohong made a passionate speech while waving her hands.", "Seol Jihu nodded his head calmly.", "\u201cI was just thinking about one.\u201d", "\u201cOh? And this came from a trustworthy source?\u201d", "\u201cMore than trustworthy.\u201d", "\u201cI see\u2026\u201d", "Chohong rubbed her hands together and giggled.", "\u201cRight, you\u2019re not the type of person to just sit still. I thought you\u2019d make your move soon.\u201d", "Then, she suddenly spoke as if she just remembered something.", "\u201cOh yeah, have you been to the palace?\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows at her sudden mention of the palace.", "\u201cNo? Why would I go there?\u201d", "\u201cTo get money.\u201d", "\u201cMoney? From what? Participating in the war was mandatory.\u201d", "\u201cNot that. You hired those kids from Blood Line.\u201d", "Only then did Seol Jihu go \u201cAh.\u201d", "He remembered Teresa mentioning this. That he should look for mercenaries and that she would pay him back later.", "Seol Jihu hesitated.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right to accept that money\u2026 I didn\u2019t hire them out of my own pocket.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s even better! You\u2019d have extra money to spend. It\u2019s true that Blood Line came to help, so there shouldn\u2019t be any problem.\u201d", "Chohong kept persuading him to take the money, but Seol Jihu seemed rather reluctant.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think Haramark has spare money right now.\u201d", "This wasn\u2019t a baseless assumption. A war required an exorbitant amount of money to be spent. Now that the war was over, not only did Haramark have to rebuild the valley fortress, but they also had to pay out their war dues.", "Even the military expansion Jan Sanctus asked for was in far reach.", "\u201cOh right, there were talks about that recently. About how people haven\u2019t received any money even though months have gone by since the war. Well, you\u2019re the one who called Blood Line, so you do what you want.\u201d", "Chohong shrugged.", "Seol Jihu slowly rubbed his chin.", "\u2018Again.\u2019", "For some reason, when he thought about Teresa, his conflicted mind suddenly tilted to one side.", "Right, it\u2019s not like the inheritance is only in one place. Other than the one in the heart of the Empire where I obviously can\u2019t go, there are still three other places.", "Seol Jihu murmured before coming to a decision. Doing her a favor before leaving Haramark didn\u2019t sound so bad.", "Having made up his mind, Seol Jihu got up.", "*", "Seol Jihu went to find Kazuki straight away. It was to ask him to become the Pathfinder for the expedition.", "When he gave a rough explanation of the situation, Kazuki unexpectedly agreed right away.", "\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu stared at him in a daze, Kazuki, who was reviewing the piece of paper with the terms and conditions of the temporary contract, raised his head.", "\u201cAh, I haven\u2019t had a lot to do recently. My team disbanded too.\u201d", "It seemed Umi Tsubame broke up into pieces in the end. Well, since Kazuki joined hands with the Triads, it was unlikely that Japan Business Federation would have sat still.", "\u201cAlso, isn\u2019t this the first expedition you planned yourself?\u201d", "Was it?", "Now that he thought about it, he had always followed others, accepted missions, or was dragged along forcefully. He had never decided alone.", "In that sense, this was indeed Seol Jihu\u2019s first expedition.", "\u201cI\u2019m curious. I doubt an expedition planned by an Earthling of your caliber will be ordinary. Anyways, I don\u2019t think following you will be a bad thing.\u201d", "Kazuki\u2019s clear praise made Seol Jihu smile bashfully.", "\u201cThank you for trusting me.\u201d", "Kazuki stared at the smiling Seol Jihu with a somewhat bitter look. Soon, he suddenly chuckled.", "\u201cI don\u2019t sense any feelings of entitlement from you. That\u2019s why I can trust you.\u201d", "With that, Kazuki flicked the paper.", "\u201cAnyways, about these terms.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cArtifacts will be distributed according to the class of the participants. This is all good, but\u2026\u201d", "Kazuki\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.", "\u201cArtifacts that do not conform to any class and artifacts that carry holy power will belong to Seol Jihu.\u201d", "Distribution of loot generally followed a 1/Nth rule. With the exception of artifacts, this basic rule of Paradise applied to even porters.", "Of course, Seol Jihu rightfully deserved more of the cut, seeing as how he was the one who planned the entire expedition, but he wasn\u2019t even saying he would pay a small price for the right to those items, which would be the norm. Rather, he was asking for an absolute ownership over them.", "\u201cCan you give me a more detailed explanation?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026 sure, it\u2019s an open secret anyways.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t that Kazuki was being greedy, and since Seol Jihu knew this was Paradise\u2019s rule, he revealed his inner thoughts openly.", "After hearing his explanation, Kazuki went \u201cAh\u201d and dropped his jaw.", "\u201cSo it\u2019s because of Lady Seo Yuhui.\u201d", "\u201cYes, from now on, I plan to give her every offering I get my hands on. So I plan to use these same terms for a while.\u201d", "\u201cIn that case, I have no complaints. We\u2019ll go with this.\u201d", "Kazuki signed the contract without hesitation, and Seol Jihu nodded his head.", "Seol Jihu knew Kazuki would understand. After all, Kazuki was also indebted to Seo Yuhui.", "\u201cWhew.\u201d", "Kazuki breathed a sigh of relief after handing the contract back to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cIf this expedition goes well, I\u2019ll finally have some room to breathe.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cAh, I need to form a new team before moving to Eva, but I\u2019m severely lacking money. Hao Win gave me some funding, but that\u2019s all debt.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cYou\u2019re going to Eva too, Mister Kazuki?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. The hill I\u2019m hiding under is moving to Eva, so how can I not? Didn\u2019t Hao Win tell you?\u201d", "Kazuki replied immediately before smiling.", "\u201cAnyways, thanks! You saved me.\u201d", "Seol Jihu waved his hand.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it too early to say thanks? We don\u2019t even know if anything is going to be there.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s true. Returning empty-handed from expeditions or explorations is an everyday occurrence.\u201d", "Having said that, Kazuki glanced at Seol Jihu and smiled silently.", "\u201cBut seeing as how you\u2019ve never failed before, I figured I can get my hopes up.\u201d", "I\u2019ve never failed before? Seol Jihu tilted his head once again.", "*", "The next place Seol Jihu visited was the royal palace.", "\u201cAn expedition?\u201d", "Seeing the young man who visited her out of the blue, Teresa's eyes opened like that of a rabbit.", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head with a bright smile.", "\u201cI heard that things have been a little loud recently. I was thinking it would be a great idea to go out, get some fresh air, and loosen up.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Teresa was clearly at a loss for words.", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t wrong. Because their finances were in the red, she had been thinking about swallowing her tears and selling the royal family\u2019s land.", "Seeing Seol Jihu who was full of smiles, Teresa reviewed the contract again.", "The terms were strangely stingy.", "No, in the first place, it was uncommon for the princess to be asked to go on an expedition. It didn\u2019t seem like he didn\u2019t know about the Royal Family\u2019s situation, so it was also strange that he was asking her to \u2018get some fresh air and loosen up.\u2019", "Moreover, it wasn\u2019t as if she was a Magician or a Priest. Carpe Diem was overflowing with skilled Warriors, so she didn\u2019t understand why he wanted to bring another Warrior with him.", "There were more than a few suspicious points.", "However, Teresa\u2019s ability to take a hint was easily a 100. There was no way that Seol Jihu was saying this without a reason.", "Teresa secretly glanced at Seol Jihu and examined him thoroughly. He seemed strangely full of confidence.", "\u2018Hold on.\u2019", "Teresa suddenly thought of the expedition offer she had received in the past from White Rose. She had put careful thought into the matter before asking Seol Jihu to join the expedition, but Seol Jihu was extremely against it at that time.", "Teresa believed in her hubby\u2019s \u2018intuition\u2019 and didn\u2019t follow White Rose\u2019s expedition. And lo and behold, not only did the expedition end in failure, but it also became the source of a spectacular political mess. Teresa remembered how relieved she was at the time.", "The important thing was Seol Jihu had a totally different attitude now compared to then. Not only was he not uncertain, but he was clearly hoping that she would go with him.", "In that instant, a bolt of lightning struck Teresa\u2019s head.", "\u2018A jackpot. A super jackpot, at that!\u2019", "She didn\u2019t know the details, but he must have received an incredible piece of info. That was why he was asking her to come.", "Teresa finally understood Seol Jihu\u2019s intentions.", "\u2018He\u2019s looking after me.\u2019", "Simply giving her the loot for free would be unfair to his teammates and possibly raise protests, so he was making her join the expedition to rightfully receive a cut.", "\u2018Again\u2026 just when I\u2019m in trouble\u2026.\u2019", "Teresa found it incredible how he appeared to save her whenever she was having a hard time. How could she not develop feelings for him?", "\u201cHaa\u2014\u201d", "Sighing from the bottom of her heart, Teresa spoke with a slightly flushed voice.", "\u201cI can really go with you?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. I mean, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s requesting you to come.\u201d", "\u201cEii, I know Carpe Diem has lots of Warriors.\u201d", "\u201cStrength isn\u2019t the only thing that matters. I\u2019m personally expecting other things from you, princess.\u201d", "The way he was putting it made Teresa feel even more apologetic.", "Seol Jihu grinned.", "\u201cYou\u2019re coming, right?\u201d", "He was going this far. How could she refuse or even play hard to get?", "Teresa nodded silently. Then, she stared at Seol Jihu fixedly.", "\u201cExcellent decision. Then\u2026\u201d", "The moment he finished saying, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when the date has been decided,\u201d he flinched.", "A subtle glance.", "He might be mistaken, but he felt like he saw two hearts blooming inside Teresa\u2019s pupils.", "\u2018N-No.\u2019", "It wasn\u2019t that he disliked the princess, but Seol Jihu considered himself a man of principle. As he vividly remembered what happened when he gave her the longsword and shield, he couldn\u2019t just ignore this problem.", "\u201cI-I\u2019ll take my leave now. And here.\u201d", "Seol Jihu hastily got up and passed the shopping bag he had brought with him in a hurry.", "Teresa, who got up as if to prevent him from escaping, licked her lips slightly with her tongue. She then blinked her eyes, seeing the shopping bag.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a gift. It\u2019s nothing big though.\u201d", "\u201cOh, my.\u201d", "It was effective.", "Teresa\u2019s eyes, which were turning more and more seductive by the second, regained their sparkle.", "\u201cI bought it when I was on Earth. I forgot to bring it with me last time I came here\u2026\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu had committed a fatal mistake. The moment Teresa heard the word \u2018gift\u2019, the light in her eyes grew more intense, and her heart-shaped pupils became clearer.", "Of course, Seol Jihu noticed this change as well.", "\u201cI bought something you need in your daily life. It\u2019s nothing big, so please accept it.\u201d", "Pang!", "\u201cI\u2019ll be off, then. Thank you for having me!\u201d", "Seol Jihu activated the Festina Earring and ran away at full speed.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "And once Seol Jihu left, Teresa stood still and looked down at the shopping bag on the desk.", "This was the first time she received a gift from an Earthling.", "She thought this every time she saw him, but\u2026", "\u2018If only Earthlings were all like him\u2026.\u2019", "How great would that be?", "In any case, she was given an unexpected way out of her predicament and an unexpected gift.", "After fiddling with the shopping bag for a long time, she shoved the stack of documents on her desk out of the way.", "\u201cEit!\u201d", "Who cared about work?", "At least for today, she wanted to indulge herself in this feeling of weightlessness.", "And soon, just like Seo Yuhui, Phi Sora, and Chohong\u2026", "Teresa had the same reaction as the other women who opened Seol Jihu\u2019s gift.", "However, her confusion at the gift only lasted a moment. Soon, the corner of the mouth curled up, and her eyes also curled to crescent shapes.", "\u201cWow\u2026.\u201d", "With a bra in one hand and panties in the other, she chuckled.", "Light pink hearts on a shade of a lovely pink color.", "Moreover\u2026", "\u201cThat person\u2026\u201d", "Looking back and forth at the underwear in each of her hands, Teresa couldn\u2019t hide her admiration.", "Putting the underwear down, she placed her hand over her mouth and giggled.", "\u201cWhat a taste!\u201d"]}
