A Tiger Father Does Not Beget a Dog Son (3)", "content": ["The day Charlotte Aria steeled her resolve, humanity issued a draft call in five cities, including Eva and Haramark.", "When the morning dawned the next day, a group of Earthlings rushed to the Eva Royal Palace. It was to protest and oppose the sudden draft call.", "Despite the flustered soldiers trying to stop them, it wasn\u2019t easy to block stubborn Earthlings from barging in, especially when there were hundreds of them.", "The Earthlings, determined, forced themselves into the grand hall with eyes that could only be described as fierce. The man leading the group was about to shout something as soon as he saw the Queen, but abruptly shut his mouth.", "Including Kim Hannah, Tong Chai, Odelette Delphine, Hao Win, and a few more\u2014 the core members of Valhalla and its affiliate organizations were waiting in the palace, expecting such a thing to happen.", "It was an excellent choice given the outcome. Without these big shots, the Earthlings would gladly have unsheathed their swords.", "But even though they shrunk back after seeing the members on standby, the spirit of the masses did not die down in the slightest. Each member of the mob was glaring viciously, clearly demonstrating that they would intimidate the royal family into retracting the draft call.", "As an uncomfortable silence flowed in the air, Sorg K\u00fchne chastised the glaring Earthlings with a stern voice.", "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been a day since the royal family ordered the draft call. Committing a grave crime akin to civil strife when every waking second is of utmost importance, are you lot out of your minds?\u201d", "\u201cCivil strife? Grave crime? Hah!\u201d", "A loud snort rang out.", "\u201cGo eat shit.\u201d", "The man who spearheaded the mob sneered, causing Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s expression to quickly stiffen. Sorg K\u00fchne tried to pressure them by mentioning their act being a crime, but they didn\u2019t give a damn as expected.", "\u201cLet us return those same words to you. Are you out of your mind?\u201d[1]", "\u201cYou?\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s eyebrows went up furtively.", "\u201cDid you forget you are in the presence of the Queen?\u201d", "\u201cFuck off. She\u2019s your Queen, not ours. Anyway, queen or not\u2014\u201d", "The man snorted and growled while revealing his yellow teeth.", "\u201cI\u2019m not gonna stay here and go on and on. Why don\u2019t you withdraw the draft call while we\u2019re being nice, huh?\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d", "The man gave an ultimatum like scolding someone\u2019s dog.", "Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s face reddened. He knew there would be some level of pushback and that some Earthlings would cross the line. But the way this Earthling was spitting out vulgar words, the pushback was harsher than he anticipated.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Why should the royal family withdraw the draft call without a lawful reason?\u201d", "\u201cHuh!? Didn\u2019t you say a war broke out in the Federation!?\u201d", "The man roared angrily, shouting like he was dying of frustration.", "\u201cThe Parasites are attacking the Federation! Why the hell should we go to Tigol Fortress!?\u201d", "\u201cAre you asking that because you truly do not know? The Federation, especially Tigol Fortress, is a neighbor of Eva\u2014\u201d", "\u201cScrew off with the strategic location bullshit!\u201d", "\u201cW-What?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t give a crap about that stuff! It would be a different story if it was Eva! But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting attacked! So why the hell should we be dragged to war against our will!?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m telling you\u2014\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne truly looked dumbstruck.", "Forget trying to persuade him, the man wasn\u2019t even listening to him! He only raised his voice, insisting that he was right.", "What was even more startling was that he confidently shouted, \u2018What the hell does the Federation being in danger have to do with us?\u2019", "However, that was simply how most Earthlings thought. To them, Paradise was no different than a stimulating, hardcore video game that they logged into whenever they were bored or had free time.", "They had Earth, a home they grew up in, a place they could return to. There was no reason for them to risk their lives for Paradise. Seol Jihu was just an exceptionally rare case.", "Before anyone noticed, loud voices were going back and forth. Furthermore, the mob cheered for the man and backed him up whenever he spoke, making the grand hall clamorous.", "While the circular argument continued meaninglessly like a gerbil running on a hamster wheel\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria was silently watching the scene with a nervous expression.", "Although she was doing her best to seem unperturbed, her jaw was shaking faintly. No matter how much she tried to hold it in, her teeth clattered continuously.", "To be honest, she was afraid.", "She was afraid of the menacing man yelling continuously. Every time he roared with his bloodshot eyes, her heart quivered. She wanted to get away from this place this instant. She tried to endure, looking at Sorg K\u00fchne, who was facing off against them alone, but\u2026", "\u201c!\u201d", "Her body automatically shrunk back whenever her eyes met the flashing eyes of the Earthlings.", "She subconsciously began to walk on eggshells to avoid getting yelled at. Having lived a sheltered life, this thorny situation was too painful to endure.", "In the end, she carefully looked around the grand hall with her head cowering. She wanted someone, anyone, to come help and protect her.", "On the other hand, she felt resentful as she looked at the quietly-standing Kim Hannah\u2019s back. She was supposed to be on her side, so why was she just standing there and watching?", "\u2018If Seol Jihu was here\u2014\u2019", "The moment she thought so, Charlotte Aria went \u201cAh\u201d. Her expression contorted to a frown.", "She had sworn never to think like that again. Even if it was just once, she wanted to stand on her own feet without relying on others.", "She really wanted to\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "It was funny. The way she loudly boasted about paying back Seol Jihu\u2019s benevolence.", "Although she mustered up her courage, the result didn\u2019t change. When reality set in, she was still the same scared little girl who couldn\u2019t say a word.", "This was Charlotte Aria\u2019s true nature as a person.", "What was even more despairingly horrendous was that she was seeking outside help even as she thought this.", "\u2018I\u2026\u2019", "In the end, nothing had changed. She would never be able to change.", "Falling into a deep self-loathing, Charlotte Aria\u2019s eyes began to glisten with tears. Soon, she shut her eyes and asked herself.", "\u2018I\u2026\u2019", "What should I do? Just what am I supposed to do in this situation?", "[Charlotte.]", "It was at this moment.", "[Listen carefully to what I am about to say.]", "The words Roselle said not too long ago suddenly crossed her mind.", "*", "\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria widened her eyes at Roselle\u2019s firm voice.", "\u201cDon\u2019t ever do anything. Just stay still and remain quiet.\u201d", "Roselle gave a sidelong glance at the girl dazedly looking up at her and continued.", "\u201cBecause you will probably get in everyone\u2019s way if you tried.\u201d", "A sudden verbal abuse came flying out.", "\u201cGiven the gravity of the situation, I would like to spend my time doing something more meaningful. Wasting my time when I\u2019m already so busy, that is the one thing I hate doing.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria\u2019s complexion turned dark from shock.", "She had heard Roselle\u2019s criticisms multiple times in her study of sorcery. But those criticisms had always been reasonable and came with advice. They were more like affectionate pointers from a master to her lacking disciple.", "But this time, it was different. Rather than calling it a criticism, it was more like a blind condemnation. To put it bluntly, Roselle was trashing her.", "Hearing such words from a teacher she trusted and respected, Charlotte Aria received a huge shock that could not be described with words.", "\u201cI may have been a little harsh, but there is no other choice. You understand, right?\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes\u2026.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria nodded her head, barely holding her tears back from bursting out.", "\u201cI\u2019m useless\u2026 I\u2019m a failure of a queen\u2026 so there\u2019s no helping it\u2026\u201d", "But hearing this, Roselle tilted her head.", "\u201cEh? No, I think you\u2019re gravely mistaken about something.\u201d", "Crossing her arms, she shook her head.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean you should stay still because you\u2019re useless.\u201d", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "\u201cIf I make a useless person do something, then it\u2019s my fault for commanding a useless person. More importantly, I wouldn\u2019t have had any expectations if you were useless.\u201d", "\u201cT-Then why?\u201d", "\u201cThe reason I was so harsh on you, Charlotte\u2026\u201d", "Roselle cleared her throat.", "\u201cIt is because you don\u2019t try to help when you have the ability.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria blinked rapidly.", "\u201cMe?\u201d", "I have\u2026 the ability? I\u2019m not trying to help despite this?", "\u201cLook. Yuri is frantically racking her brains to try to do something. You\u2019re in a much more advantageous position, yet you\u2019re only sucking your thumbs. How spiteful would she feel?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2014!\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t say no.\u201d", "Roselle cut her off sharply.", "\u201cAs I said before, you are the queen of a kingdom. A queen is someone who leads and is respected by the masses. Would a person of such a position truly lack the ability to help?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria was struck speechless and could only stand with her mouth agape.", "Roselle gave her a sideways glance before letting out a heavy sigh and shaking her head.", "\u201cWhat a poor man! He is doing something that might be impossible even with the support of his wives. Yet, the woman who should be his most reliable ally is calling herself a failure of a queen and binding her hands and feet. Ah~ How pitiful.\u201d", "Although she made it sound like a monologue, it was clear that she meant for Charlotte Aria to hear it.", "\u201cEeek\u2026!\u201d", "Once Seol Jihu was brought up, Charlotte Aria flew into a rage, her eyes flaring. However, facing Roselle\u2019s cold pupils, Charlotte Aria instinctively averted her gaze.", "\u201cN-No, I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t help\u2026. There\u2019s a royal administrator called Sorg K\u00fchne\u2026 He\u2019s very loyal and capable\u2026.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria stammered.", "Roselle\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "\u201cSee?\u201d", "Her voice suddenly changed. Rather than purposely offending, it was chastising someone who truly did wrong.", "\u201cLetting the heart be hot, the head be cold. No, I don\u2019t expect this much. Charlotte, you are incapable of even being angry at your inaction. How can you get enraged at the current state of affairs and step up to the plate?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria dropped her head dejectedly.", "\u201c\u2026Charlotte.\u201d", "Roselle smiled bitterly and called out to Charlotte quietly and tenderly.", "\u201cI will ask you one last time.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cDo you truly wish to help that man?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Un.\u201d", "\u201cReally? Is it not a fleeting feeling? Do you truly feel that way?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria quietly nodded her head.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "But reading her thoughts, Roselle denied it.", "\u201cLook straight at your inner self. In my eyes, it is only a temporary feeling, just like how a boiling pot becomes cool when it is no longer applied with heat.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria gently bit her lower lip.", "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d", "However, Roselle\u2019s cold words took a turn.", "\u201cFinding out that an always cool pot can heat up is a very worthwhile thing.\u201d", "Saying so, Roselle gave a beaming smile.", "\u201cPerhaps this might be the first and last chance for you to grow.\u201d", "\u201cA chance for me to grow?\u201d", "\u201cYes. No matter what anyone says, you are the direct descent of the Aria Family. The sole member of the lineage that governs thunder and lightning.\u201d", "Roselle\u2019s eyes lit up, and she asked.", "\u201cCharlotte, do you remember what the most important element is for the development of bloodline magic?\u201d", "\u201cEmotion.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria answered right away.", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. The bloodline of water requires flexible thinking, the bloodline of fire requires unrelenting courage, the bloodline of ice requires imperturbable reason, and the bloodline of lightning requires\u2026\u201d", "Roselle trailed off and glanced down. She was signaling Charlotte Aria to finish the sentence.", "Charlotte Aria replied with an entranced expression.", "\u201cRage.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d", "Roselle clapped.", "\u201cThe bloodline of lightning requires rage that opposes injustice.\u201d", "Then, she shrugged.", "\u201cBut Charlotte isn\u2019t the type to get enraged by nature. Or should I say it\u2019s by acquisition, rather? Anyway, it should be difficult for you to get truly enraged.\u201d", "Roselle winked at the dazedly staring Charlotte Aria.", "\u201cSoooo! This teacher is going to tell you about a special method.\u201d", "\u201cA special method?\u201d", "\u201cYes, a special method.\u201d", "Roselle said clearly.", "\u201cIf you find it difficult to get enraged on your own, why not borrow someone else\u2019s power? Don\u2019t you have more confidence in doing that?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria was taken aback by her playful tone.", "\u201cI-I don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s simple.

The same goes for this situation.\u201d", "Roselle continued.", "\u201cLook back and remember. Think about the people you could have helped and what happened as a result of you doing nothing. Think about what will happen.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria flinched.", "The faces of two people who had already departed and one person who might depart flashed across her mind.", "\u201cOnce you\u2019ve done that\u2014\u201d", "Roselle spoke.", "\u201cRage.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria\u2019s complexion waned.", "\u201cThe target can be anyone.

The mob of Earthlings was protesting in a near-riot, and Sorg K\u00fchne was facing them all alone.", "Charlotte Aria carefully observed the mob with a subdued gaze. Then, she slowly remembered.

Every second of every minute is of utmost importance.]", "And Seol Jihu, who was devoted to Paradise more than anyone else.", "And when she did, suddenly, an indescribable something boiled from the bottom of her heart and shot up honestly.", "\u2018Why?\u2019", "Evangeline Rose had put in so much effort.", "Seol Jihu was risking his life, crossing the line between life and death.", "\u2018Why?\u2019", "They\u2019re the same Earthlings, so why were they so different?", "Was it a lack of reason? A lack of justification?", "It was obvious that humanity would be next once Tigol Fortress was toppled and the Federation fell. So how could these people so shamelessly act like thugs in this grand hall?", "In truth, this was a question she should have asked a long time ago. But to Charlotte Aria, who always anxiously repeated, \u2018It\u2019s too agonizing. Help!\u2019, this was a somewhat new emotion.", "And so\u2026", "[Rage.]", "She raged.", "[Towards what doesn\u2019t matter. Just rage, and rage again.]", "She gritted her teeth, hearing the ruffians who refused to even listen to Sorg K\u00fchne.", "Rage shot up from her heart, seeing the scoundrels who made a mess of Seol Jihu\u2019s plans and tried to destroy it.", "Frustration exploded at herself, who could not utter a single word properly.", "\u2018Why!?\u2019", "Charlotte Aria groaned quietly.", "Her face was hot.

The Queen\u2019s command? You mean your command! Everyone knows you\u2019re the regent of the kingdom! Do you take us to be fools!?\u201d", "The man roared before suddenly adorning a sneer.", "\u201cGood thing you brought it up! Right, let\u2019s ask while we\u2019re on this topic whether the Queen really wants a war.\u201d", "He pointed with his finger and asked.", "\u201cCome to think of it, didn\u2019t humans go to war against the Federation in the past?\u201d", "\u201cThat was a long time ago.
