She was unable to sit or walk comfortably the entire trip, even though she was visiting what should be a nostalgic place.", "Since the only memories she had of the mountain were rolling on the ground like a dog, taking a breath of air made her feel more disgusted than refreshed.", "\u2018Being a temporary leader really saved my ass\u2026.\u2019", "After arriving at the place Jang Maldong had told her about, Chohong let out a deep sigh before craning her neck out and looking around the vicinity. She could see something black moving in a zigzag from one mountain peak to the other in the distance.", "\u201cHeeey!\u201d", "She waited until it came near, and when she waved her hands, Hugo stopped after descending the mountain slope. He looked at Chohong and wiped off his dripping sweat.", "\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d", "\u201cRejoice! Your Messiah has come to save you from your distress.\u201d", "\u201cMessiah\u2026. Why couldn\u2019t you have come earlier?\u201d", "\u201cWatch what you say! This mountain is the territory of an evil devil. Even I, the Messiah, have to risk unimaginable danger to get here.\u201d", "\u201cFuck, you call yourself a Messiah when your own safety is the first thing on your priority list?\u201d", "When Hugo grumbled, Chohong giggled uncontrollably.", "\u201cSince you\u2019re still up and running, I\u2019m guessing that it wasn\u2019t half bad, huh?\u201d", "\u201cNo, no,\u201d Hugo shook his head and grinned.", "\u201cI trained earnestly while a certain someone was lazing around at home.\u201d", "\u201cOh?\u201d", "\u201cJust you wait, I\u2019ll show you the fruits of my training, fufufufu!\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s facial muscles twitched hearing Hugo\u2019s declaration of war. She placed her hand by her ear and leaned forward toward him.", "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d", "\u201cNever mind.\u201d", "\u201cWhaaat?\u201d", "\u201cAre you deaf?\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I just couldn\u2019t hear what you said because it was coming from a LOSER who\u2019s not even a High Ranker.\u201d", "Hugo\u2019s expression stiffened.", "\u201cY-You\u2019re only a false High Ranker.\u201d", "\u201cMhm, next Level 4 who can\u2019t even become a false High Ranker, please.\u201d", "\u201cBitch!\u201d", "Hugo pounced on her before quickly backing off. Chohong had taken out her \u2018+2 Thorn of Steel\u2019.", "\u201cKyaaa, look at this thing. It\u2019s gorgeous no matter how many times I marvel at it. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d", "\u201cFuck you!\u201d", "\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve actually been itching for a fight. For some reason, I haven\u2019t seen a single monster on my way up here either.\u201d", "When Chohong glanced at him, Hugo flinched and shouted in injustice.", "\u201cY-You just got lucky with Seol giving you that mace!\u201d", "\u201cLike you\u2019re the one to speak. Didn\u2019t you take Khan\u2019s halberd when he died in the Forest of Denial?\u201d", "\u201cThat and this are separate matters!\u201d", "\u201cYeah, yeah~ What can I do~? Seol just likes me more. If you aren\u2019t happy, go appeal to him too~\u201d Chohong smirked and sneered at Hugo.", "\u201cAnyways, should you really be worried about me? You lost all your equipment when you got captured last time.\u201d", "Chohong stabbed where it hurt the most, and Hugo\u2019s face contorted. In the end\u2026 \u201cHuaaaang!\u201d He burst into tears and ran off.", "\u201cHmph, you\u2019re no match for me.\u201d Chohong snorted and walked onward leisurely. Soon, she spotted a bizarre old tree. It was a tree measuring more than two arms\u2019 width around, but more importantly, its leaves had all fallen on the ground.", "\u2018Damn, the old man must have come up with another strange training method.\u2019 That was the first thing she thought of when she saw this poor old tree. Soon, she found the cave hideout on the hill. When she saw Jang Maldong standing in front of it, she immediately bowed down to her waist.", "Jang Maldong replied without even looking at her.", "\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d", "\u201cI am.\u201d", "\u201cYou look nice.\u201d", "\u201cHow can you tell when you haven\u2019t even looked at me?\u201d", "\u201cI only need to hear your voice to know.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about making me train, stop dreaming. I need to go back soon to take care of an important matter.\u201d", "Chohong paused, as Jang Maldong had raised his hand. However, he was staring into the distance with a thoughtful look.", "Chohong also turned her gaze. There, she saw a young man stabbing and slicing the air with a spear. He displayed a series of spear techniques while dodging about a dozen wooden logs flying toward him.", "\u201cYou\u2019re already making him do that?\u201d", "\u201cBe quiet.\u201d Jang Maldong crossed his arms, tapping his arm with his right thumb.", "\u201cOh?\u201d Chohong exclaimed in surprise, seeing Seol Jihu dodge the logs rather well.", "\u201cHow many has he dodged so far?\u201d", "\u201cOver 100.\u201d", "Chohong stood tall and watched the young man with a relaxed expression. However, that only lasted a moment. Once the young man surpassed 200, and then 300 dodges, she couldn\u2019t help but jump in surprise.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t this his first training?\u201d", "The moment she asked this, Seol Jihu collapsed. Several logs had unexpectedly shot toward him from all directions. Perhaps he had miscalculated, as he couldn\u2019t dodge one of them and was struck on his side.", "Jang Maldong\u2019s thumb stopped.", "\u201c312.\u201d", "A satisfied smile bloomed on his aged face.", "\u201cSo he finally surpassed 300. That\u2019s his newest record.\u201d", "Chohong whistled.", "\u201cWow! Then again, my highest record is 1008.\u201d", "\u201cYou pulled that off once.\u201d", "\u201cBut a record is a record.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. Though, you did take over a year to accomplish that.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Chet.\u201d Chohong turned away. Jang Maldong smiled as he watched Seol Jihu kicking himself, before turning around and facing Chohong.", "\u201cSo what\u2019s this important matter?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just one or two things. There\u2019s even this huge incident\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cSpeak.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll explain on our way back. The carriage driver is probably shaking in his seat.\u201d", "\u201cYou sure are pulling all sorts of tricks to avoid training.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not! Anyways, hurry!\u201d", "Chohong shouted indignantly before running down the hill. Jang Maldong smirked and then shouted that the training was over. Seol Jihu and Hugo immediately came running.", "As they had already packed their bags in the morning, it didn\u2019t take long for them to get going.", "\u201cHut, hut!\u201d", "Seol Jihu threw his bags over his shoulder, and then glanced back. Looking at the cave he had stayed in for the past month, a bittersweet feeling welled up inside him.", "\u2018I can always come back later.\u2019", "Shortly afterward, he made a refreshing smile and turned back.", "*", "The carriage carrying Carpe Diem\u2019s four members began to race toward Haramark at full speed.", "\u201cSo what\u2019s this huge incident?\u201d Jang Maldong asked once the speed picked up.", "Chohong, who was grumbling about the sweaty smell Hugo and Seol Jihu were giving off, spat a mouthful of saliva out of the carriage before opening her mouth.", "\u201cFirst, hundreds of villagers from Ramman Village moved into the city.\u201d", "\u201cOh yeah?\u201d", "As Jang Maldong felt deep sympathy and all sorts of indebtedness towards Paradisians, he immediately expressed his interest.", "\u201cHoho, that should have happened a long time ago! After all, Ramman Village is close to the border region\u2026. Anyways, I suspect that there were some unhappy voices. There\u2019s also the problem with where they would stay.\u201d", "\u201cActually, it\u2019s been pretty quiet.\u201d", "\u201cQuiet? I doubt those bastards playing real estate would sit still and watch.\u201d", "\u201cWhat can they do when the rightful owner of the land tells them to give it up? Well, the royal family took the initiative to concede half of the land to the villagers. More importantly, the Temple of Luxuria publicly announced their support for the Haramark Royal Family\u2019s decision.\u201d", "\u201cThe Temple of Luxuria did?\u201d", "Jang Maldong was looking at the young man sitting next to him with a grin when he heard this and became surprised.", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t just support the royal family with words. They said they would even support the move directly.\u201d Chohong continued, \u201cIn fact, just a few days after the announcement, the Daughter of Luxuria appeared in Haramark.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Jang Maldong\u2019s eyes widened greatly. Hugo also dropped his jaw, and then a gulp went down his throat.", "\u201cThe Executor is personally overseeing this matter? No, she\u2019s the one who made the announcement?\u201d", "\u201cHey, did you see her?\u201d", "When Jang Maldong and Hugo asked at the same time, Chohong cleared her throat.", "\u201cThe Temple of Luxuria made the announcement, but there is a ton of people who think she\u2019s the one who made the call. I\u2019m also one of them.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, she is someone who has saved Paradise from danger numerous times. She must have lent a hand so that there wouldn\u2019t be any problem with the move.\u201d", "Jang Maldong nodded his head referring to her politely. Although they had no prior contact, he saw her in a favorable light from all the stories he had heard about her feats.", "\u201cShe is most certainly the type to do something like that. She must have come to Haramark to help with the move personally.\u201d", "\u201cWell, here\u2019s where the huge incident comes in.\u201d", "Chohong paused as if what she had to say next eclipsed everything she said before. Jang Maldong scowled.", "\u201cHurry up and say it!\u201d", "\u201cHeeey, I\u2019m asking if you saw her!!\u201d", "Hugo also shouted. Chohong giggled in response.", "\u201cRemember the building in front of our office that went under construction?\u201d", "\u201cNow that you mention it, it did change.\u201d", "\u201cThe owner of that building is the Daughter of Luxuria.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026W-What?\u201d", "\u201cI know! She moved right in front of us!\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d Jang Maldong revealed a strong hint of suspicion, and Chohong immediately jumped up.", "\u201cCome on! Have you been tricked your whole life? I saw her tending to her garden just this morning!\u201d", "Judging from Chohong\u2019s reaction, it didn\u2019t seem like she was lying.", "\u201cAnyways, that\u2019s been the talk of the entire city for the past few days. There was even a huge crowd in front of the building.\u201d", "\u201cHoh\u2026. Why would she move to Haramark\u2026?\u201d", "Jang Maldong leaned back in his seat with a face that said he just couldn\u2019t figure it out. Then, after a brief moment of silence, he opened his mouth.", "\u201cIt\u2019s indeed a huge incident.\u201d", "\u201cNow we have another thing to brag about! Being neighbors with the Daughter of Luxuria!\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s enough nonsense out of you. What about Kazuki?\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s under a lot of stress.\u201d", "Chohong smacked her lips.", "\u201cHe seems to be trying hard\u2026 but it looks like there\u2019s an outside interference.\u201d", "Jang Maldong furrowed his brows.", "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you help?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t want to. I might have connections with Archers and Warriors but none with Priests. You should know this.\u201d", "Chohong shrugged her shoulders, and Jang Maldong showed signs of annoyance.", "\u201cTsk, looks like the Japan Business Federation has finally done it\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s Tsuji Yuki we\u2019re talking about here. Just wait. There\u2019s still time left, and I doubt Kazuki will simply sit still.\u201d", "That was the end of the conversation, as Jang Maldong dropped his head and fell into deep contemplation.", "Chohong stretched and slowly leaned against Seol Jihu, who was staring blankly into the air.", "\u201cHey.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201d", "\u201cAre you looking at your Status Window?
