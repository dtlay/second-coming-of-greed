{"cid": "446", "title": "Chapter 446. While He is Gone (3)", "content": ["Over a dozen people were sitting in Valhalla\u2019s grand conference room. Everyone who was related to Seol Jihu had come together to discuss plans for his revival.", "\u201cThere is something I need to say before this meeting begins.\u201d", "Philip Muller, who was in charge of leading the meeting, spoke up.", "\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you all know, contribution points can only be used individually, unless it\u2019s for the purchase of stamps or the custody of the Neutral Zone.\u201d", "Getting \u2018carried\u2019 or helping someone get carried wasn\u2019t easy in Paradise. It was because Earthlings couldn\u2019t give and receive contribution points.", "Furthermore, because the Seven Sins had strict rules in place regarding the distribution of contribution points, there was a limit to helping someone amass points.", "For example, even if Person A put a monster on the brink of death and had Person B finish it off, Person B would only get a limited amount of contribution points.", "It might be possible to borrow the power of an organization to create a situation where an individual could amass points, but there was a limit to how far one could go.", "This was also the main reason Sinyoung gave up on reviving Eun Yuri a long time ago.", "\u201cIn addition, each Earthling only has one chance to be revived in Paradise. There can be no exception.\u201d", "Philip Muller emphasized this last point. If they somehow managed to revive Seol Jihu with a Divine Wish and he died again, then they would really be left without an option.", "\u201cWe have to understand that the Parasite Queen\u2019s goal had been Seol Jihu\u2019s elimination all along. It wasn\u2019t the stele of the Imperial Oath.\u201d", "Everyone nodded in agreement at Philip Muller\u2019s explanation.", "\u201cThere is no way that the Parasite Queen doesn\u2019t know about the Earthlings\u2019 revival setting. She even has Sung Shihyun as one of her trusted aides.\u201d", "Philip Muller continued.", "\u201cSung Shihyun was a Unique Ranker, a long-time veteran of Paradise, and the Executor of Gula. He must know about the revival setting better than anyone else.\u201d", "Meaning, the Parasite Queen wouldn\u2019t have stopped at merely killing Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we don\u2019t know the exact details of Seol Jihu\u2019s death.\u201d", "Philip Muller spoke calmly.", "\u201cThe witch called Roselle said she watched over the situation, but\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIt was only to a certain degree.\u201d", "\u201cWe need to know what that degree exactly is.\u201d", "\u201cTeacher said she\u2019s not sure.\u201d", "Eun Yuri spoke up at Philip Muller\u2019s request.", "\u201cShe can leave a mark of mana on her target to feel and perceive their surroundings, but it\u2019s only a feeling of what\u2019s happening on the outside. For example, feeling intense energy from someone or sensing unique bloodline mana.\u201d", "Meaning, Roselle felt the raging storm of energy from when Seol Jihu died, but she did not comprehend what exactly was happening inside Seol Jihu\u2019s body.", "\u201cWe\u2019re just going to use her account of the incident as a reference. We won\u2019t rely on it.\u201d", "Philip Muller spoke firmly.", "\u201cTo be clear, we only have one chance. So I won\u2019t accept any suggestions that banks on a best-case scenario or a maybe. I will only accept ideas that have a 100 percent chance of success that take the worst-case scenario into account.\u201d", "With that, he scanned the room again.", "\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s begin.\u201d", "Only after confirming that there was no disagreement did he start the meeting.", "\u201cFirst, we need a Divine Wish to let Seol Jihu regain his memories and re-enter Paradise.\u201d", "Everyone agreed as they all thought the same thing.", "\u201cThe problem comes afterward.\u201d", "Philip Muller smacked his lips.", "\u201cNormally, a single Divine Wish is enough to revive someone to a functional state\u2026\u201d", "But it seemed that wouldn\u2019t be the case this time judging by what Eun Yuri said.", "The Parasite Queen seemed to have done something to Seol Jihu, and because Seol Jihu also did something to counteract it, things got even more complicated.", "\u201cCan you explain the situation from back then again? After Seol Jihu\u2019s death was confirmed, I mean.\u201d", "Eun Yuri nodded and looked up at the ceiling.", "\u201cThe Parasite Queen reached her hand out toward Jihu Oppa\u2026 and a cluster of light was supposedly put into his body. A terrifying energy raged inside him afterward, putting Oppa in agony\u2026.\u201d", "Eun Yuri dropped her head and lowered her eyes.", "\u201cTeacher said she never felt such powerful energy before. She guessed that it was the Parasite Queen\u2019s divinity.\u201d", "\u201cBecause Representative Seol has Temperance\u2019s divinity and the rest of the Army Commanders are alive?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cIf your teacher\u2019s theory is correct, then that process must have been the Parasite Queen\u2019s ploy to prevent Seol Jihu\u2019s revival\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cTeacher and I are also in agreement. The Parasite Queen devoured Paradise\u2019s Chief Deity, who was ranked above the Seven Sins, and there is also her original level of divinity to take into account as well. If Oppa died in that state\u2026 having an infinite number of Divine Wishes likely wouldn\u2019t have been enough.\u201d", "Philip Muller closed his eyes at Eun Yuri\u2019s calm explanation. The saving grace was that the situation did not end there.", "\u201cYou said Seol Jihu did something after he escaped, correct?\u201d", "\u201cYes, he used the Harmonia Magic Square.\u201d", "A few people\u2019s faces darkened at Eun Yuri\u2019s explanation. They remembered how Jang Maldong said Seol Jihu must never use that item.", "Philip Muller rubbed his chin.", "\u201cI do have my own opinion regarding this\u2026 but what does that witch think?\u201d", "\u201cI assume your opinion matches that of Teacher\u2019s. The Harmonia Magic Square has the energy of Absolute Evil. It is an artificial divinity created by mixing the essence of the Seven Sins. Oppa must have realized the Parasite Queen\u2019s goal and used it as a final resort.\u201d", "\u201cAnd?\u201d", "\u201cTeacher said that the Parasite Queen\u2019s divinity and the Seven Sins\u2019 divinity fought fiercely and ultimately neutralized each other. Apparently, the process was so intense that a crazy amount of energy was emitted outside\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t understand.\u201d", "A sharp glint flashed in Philip Muller\u2019s eyes.", "\u201cEven if the two energies were polar opposites of each other, the Harmonia Magic Square should have tried to force them to co-exist, no? Of course, if that actually happened, that would have only helped the Parasite Queen\u2019s goal.\u201d", "\u201cAbout that\u2026 I\u2019m not sure either.\u201d", "Eun Yuri shook her head.", "\u201cTeacher said she felt a powerful reverse flow on top of the reverse flow that was already present\u2026.\u201d", "Philip Muller\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a bit strange. Are you positive?\u201d", "\u201cTeacher said she could guarantee that there was another reverse flow energy. She said she didn\u2019t know the principle behind it, though.\u201d", "\u201cAlright, let\u2019s just say that is the case. Then did the two energies neutralize each other completely? What I mean is, is there any chance that some of it was left over?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d", "\u201cWhat about the magic square that should have taken root inside his body? Do we know how it will affect him after he revives?\u201d", "\u201cNo, that\u2019s a mystery as well.\u201d", "Eun Yuri shook her head once again.", "Philip Muller was about to ask again but swallowed his words. There was no meaning to it.", "Then again, the effect of two rampaging divine energies was something beyond human understanding.", "\u2018Son of a bitch\u2026.\u2019", "Philip Muller cursed inwardly.", "The Parasite Queen\u2019s divinity, the essence of the Seven Sins, a reverse flow of a reverse flow\u2026", "He couldn\u2019t begin to imagine just how much of a mess these elements must have made to the already damaged body of Seol Jihu.", "This was only the surface as well. There was also the possibility that his mana was reversed, or his body was contaminated.", "\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d", "Philip Muller let out a sigh as the situation only got more complicated the deeper he delved into it.", "\u201cSo\u2026 just one Divine Wish won\u2019t be enough?\u201d", "When the two Magicians fell silent, Chohong carefully asked.", "\u201cYes. Even if we manage to revive him, it is likely that he won\u2019t even be able to move, much less battle.\u201d", "Eun Yuri spoke in a subdued voice.", "\u201cHis body might even explode the moment he tries to use mana\u2026.\u201d", "She then did a double-take and blinked.", "\u201cAh, sorry.\u201d", "\u201cSorry about what?\u201d", "When Chohong asked, Eun Yuri glanced at Philip Muller.", "\u201cI was supposed to consider the worst-case scenario\u2026 but I ended up talking about the best-case scenario\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s eyes widened. It wasn\u2019t just her. Everyone\u2019s faces froze up.", "That just now wasn\u2019t the worst-case scenario, but the best?", "\u201cT-Then in the worst-case scenario\u2026.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah asked with a trembling voice.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a chance\u2026.\u201d", "Eun Yuri dropped her head.", "\u201cThat he might die as soon as he\u2019s revived\u2026.\u201d", "Gasps rang out from the surroundings. Chohong looked like she was having a hard time believing it, but she didn\u2019t say anything out loud. It was because she remembered the horrific cracks on Seol Jihu\u2019s corpse.", "\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t die\u2026 he might fall into a coma immediately.\u201d", "Chohong looked back at Philip Muller at a loss for words.", "\u201cIt will be meaningless if we revive him in a half-dead state. We need to make sure he at least has his consciousness and can move his body.\u201d", "Philip Muller sounded somber.", "After a moment of silence\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Two.\u201d", "Philip Muller announced with a deep sigh.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll need two Divine Wishes at the very least. One to revive him, and one to heal his body. This is also the minimum amount.\u201d", "\u201cTwo\u2026.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah frowned.", "\u201cH-How about this? First, we revive him, and then we pour healing spells on him. Yuhui Unni can hold a Ceremony if she has to.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Philip Muller rejected the idea right away.", "\u201cThe level of injury he suffered this time is on a completely different level than the one he suffered during the Arden Valley War. Back then, Seol Jihu only reversed the flow of his own energy.\u201d", "Philip Muller remembered Seol Jihu\u2019s state vividly as he had personally examined him.", "\u201cThe Star of Lust held a Ceremony back then, and Master Jang and the Sacred Empress were both attending to him constantly. Even then, he only managed to hold out until the Federation arrived with the Elixeer.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThe problem this time is divinity. No matter how powerful the Star of Lust is, there is a limit to what she can do as a mere human.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah clenched her teeth at Philip Muller\u2019s logical explanation.", "\u201cBut\u2026 Orabeo-nim walked in that state for a while. Doesn\u2019t that mean he\u2014\u201d", "\u201cAs I said before, Oppa\u2019s death was confirmed before he escaped from the Parasites.\u201d", "At that moment, Eun Yuri sharply interrupted Yi Seol-Ah.", "\u201cHim not recovering any mana after he used the remainder of his energy is proof of that.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah was at a loss for words.", "\u201cAs for how he got back up and walked for some time\u2026 Teacher said she couldn\u2019t understand it either. She said it felt like she was looking at a different person.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no way to tell whether it was from the influence of the raging divinity inside him or superhuman perseverance\u2026. But what we can be sure of is that Oppa ignited his lifeforce when he faced the combined attack of the Army Commanders, and that this lifeforce flickered off when he was stuck in the pit.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah\u2019s lips trembled at the cold voice.", "\u201c\u2026Humans\u2019 willpower indeed works in mysterious ways. I hear that there is a term called fighting spirit in Asian culture too.\u201d", "Philip Muller muttered quietly.", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say. Let\u2019s say we only use a single Divine Wish to revive Seol jihu. Can you guarantee that he will be conscious and be able to move his body for a while? Even so, can you guarantee he will be able to hold on with just his willpower alone?\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah could only shake her head as Philip Muller asked if she could take responsibility.", "\u201c\u2026No.\u201d", "In the end, she began to tear up.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand your sentiment\u2026\u201d", "Philip Muller smacked his lips.", "\u201cBut one chance is all we\u2019ve got. Just one\u2026. We can\u2019t gamble with Seol Jihu\u2019s life. If anything, for the penalty he will have to face on Earth.\u201d", "Everything he said was right.", "\u201cI won\u2019t say more. We somehow need to acquire two Divine Wishes.\u201d", "However, Philip Muller was at a loss for what to do. Acquiring one Divine Wish was difficult enough. Two seemed almost impossible.", "Frankly speaking, there wasn\u2019t a single Earthling who could use a Divine Wish. Not only Philip Muller, but Baek Haeju and Seo Yuhui had also visited the temple to check.", "The answer they received from the Seven Sins was that they did not have enough contribution points to use a Divine Wish.", "\u201cNow then\u2026.\u201d", "Philip Muller discussed with everyone to solve this problem.", "Since no one had enough contribution points to use a Divine Wish at the moment, they brainstormed methods to acquire contribution points in the quickest way possible.", "As this was not a problem where the solution could be reached within a single day, they made slow progress, and the meeting went on for a few days.", "However, time did not wait for them. The situation everyone feared came true. It was a problem bigger than Seol Jihu\u2019s revival. To be more precise, the Parasite Queen was not so kind as to wait for them to concoct a plan.", "The Parasites invaded humanity from two directions.", "With four Army Commanders leading the way.", "*", "News of the Parasites\u2019 attack quickly spread throughout the Federation and humanity. At the same time, the meeting in Valhalla came to an end. Since they had to prepare for war, they no longer had time to sit around and rack their brains.", "That said, they came up with a temporary plan \u2014 to help one person gain as many contribution points as possible from the war.", "It really wasn\u2019t much of a plan, but they didn\u2019t have any other option.", "When the last meeting ended, Eun Yuri suddenly stopped while climbing the stairs to her room. Last night, Roselle had summoned her three disciples and made an important announcement.", "[Yuri will be my successor.]", "[I know all three of you have worked hard, so I wanted to watch over you all for a little while longer\u2026 but it seems the situation won\u2019t allow it.]", "Roselle had finally decided on a successor to carry on the \u2018Eternal Light of Wisdom\u2019. Eun Yuri would have jumped with joy if it was at any other time, but with the current situation being what it was, she couldn\u2019t be purely happy.", "In fact, she felt a tremendous weight on her shoulders that she did not feel before. It was because she knew what Roselle was expecting of her as her successor.", "Because of it, Eun Yuri\u2019s feet took her to a different place. She stopped, not in front of her room, but in front of an office.", "It was the place Seol Jihu spent most of his time when he was in Valhalla.", "\u201cWhew.\u201d", "Eun Yuri went into the room, closed the door behind her, and sighed quietly.", "She then moved and stood in front of the office desk.", "She was the only one inside the room. The man who usually sat behind the desk was naturally not there.", "[Uh\u2026 I\u2019m really okay\u2026.]", "Looking at the desk\u2026", "[I see, I see. This feels much better. Thank you.]", "She recalled the time she helped Seol Jihu stand after he returned drunk from the pub.", "[I thought I\u2019d be fine\u2026.]", "After Seol Jihu disappeared, yet another danger had descended upon them. Humanity now had to overcome this danger.", "But how?", "There were things Seol Jihu left behind\u2014written oaths from influential organizations of each city, an alliance with the Federation, and the fortification of all cities, including Eva\u2026.", "But to be frank, this wasn\u2019t enough. They needed something else.", "Just like how a certain person defended a valley fortress by putting himself out as bait.", "Just like how a certain person came up with a way to teleport into the laboratory and stopped the Parasites\u2019 plan to mass-produce Mutant Orcs.", "Just like how a certain person killed Undying Diligence and sent the Parasites retreating.", "Just like how a certain person saved the Spirit Realm and protected Tigol Fortress.", "They needed a new way to break through this danger.", "Loneliness swept over Eun Yuri as she looked at the empty desk.", "She felt like she finally began to understand.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "No, to be honest, she did not understand yet.", "[I thought I could do it somehow\u2026]", "Eun Yuri did not dare to guess\u2026", "[Sometimes I get so tired\u2026]", "How Seol Jihu must have shouldered such a heavy burden all this time.", "\u201cOppa\u2026.\u201d", "Looking at the empty desk and chair reflecting the light of the sun\u2026", "\u201cWhat\u2026.\u201d", "Eun Yuri murmured in a daze.", "\u201cWhat are we supposed to do\u2026?\u201d"]}
