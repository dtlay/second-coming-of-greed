The Banquet Has Already Started", "content": ["\u300eThe history of the Banquet dates back to the time when a mysterious passenger ship was found at the Mariposa Sea near the city of Nur. The first eyewitness, Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez (Spain), described the moment as follows:", "\u2018It was early dawn. I was looking out from the Port of Nur at the serene sea when I suddenly felt a huge shadow creep up. The night fog blurred my vision, so I couldn\u2019t make out its size, but I could tell that its size far surpassed a normal passenger ship. It swayed in the sea for about two minutes before vanishing into thin air.\u2019", "The mysterious ship attracted an unusual level of attention, and Earthlings flocked to the Port of Nur to solve the mystery. However, the ship didn\u2019t appear again, and the Earthlings disbanded, thinking it was just a simple incident.", "Just like that, the incident seemed to have come to a conclusion. But eight days later\u2026 an Earthling appeared, claiming to have seen a mysterious ship at the Libera Lake near the city of Eva.", "Ze Mei\u2019s (China) account corroborated Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez\u2019s story, but it didn\u2019t attract much attention due to the following two reasons:", "1) Nur and Eva were cities on opposite ends of the map, and it was impossible to cross the distance in eight days even by sea.", "2) More importantly, Mariposa and Libera weren\u2019t connected bodies of water.", "However, six days later, an incident arose that took public opinion by a storm. A third account of the same incident came out of Haramark\u2019s Ramman River\u2026.\u300f", "Seol Jihu took his eyes off the paper and took a short break. His eyes were starting to get tired, but he also needed some time to organize his thoughts.", "The records showed that the appearances of mysterious ghost ships signaled the start of the Banquet. After appearing and vanishing in the waters of the seven kingdoms for two months, \u2018entrances\u2019 would appear all over Paradise.", "Then where did these entrances lead to? And why were Earthlings so enthusiastic about the Banquet?", "Unquenchable curiosity compelled Seol Jihu to turn his gaze to the records.", "\u300e\u2026The entrances all share a few characteristics-", "1) They come in all colors and forms.", "2) Once ten people enter, they lose the ability to admit more people.", "3) Once created, they reappear in the same spot every two years.", "4) People who enter are moved to an unknown place that is different every time.\u300f", "\u2018An unknown place?\u2019", "This particular phrase caught Seol Jihu\u2019s attention, but remembering the transfer magic circles used in the rescue mission, he guessed that the entrances had a similar mechanism.", "\u2018So that\u2019s why the Banquet is unpredictable.\u2019", "The fourth characteristic gave a clue as to why the Banquet was unpredictable. The overall structure might be the same every time, but since the place and the detailed contents of the Banquet changed every time, it made sense why there was no clear way to prepare for the Banquet.", "The Banquet was separated into three stages. Although finding the entrances were once considered a separate stage, these days, it didn\u2019t have much meaning because several organizations noticed the third rule during the second Banquet and had secured over 80 percent of the entrances.", "In any case, after moving to the unknown place, the participants had to go through Stage 1 and Stage 2. The goal for these two stages was to safely arrive at a designated location.", "In Stage 2, participants could receive an item called the \u2018Dissonant Wish\u2019, and the ultimate goal of this stage was to board a ship.", "To summarize, Stage 1 and Stage 2 were battles of wits with cooperation as the overarching theme.", "If the participants worked together, although it would take them more time, they would be able to obtain equal rewards. However, it was hard to expect people to cooperate in a situation where selfishness was encouraged.", "This was surmised to be the reason for the \u2018catastrophe\u2019 that had erupted during the fourth Banquet.", "As for Stage 3, it was unfortunately wrapped in a veil of mystery. Unlike Stage 1 and Stage 2, the requirement for entering Stage 3 changed every time, and almost nothing was known about the goal or the content of this stage.", "That was because the survivors of Stage 3 refused to talk about it. To be precise, they were prohibited from talking about it due to an \u2018oath\u2019.", "However, one survivor explained, \u201cThat place wasn\u2019t a ghost ship, but a treasure ship.\u201d From this, people guessed that Stage 3 was inside the mysterious ship that appeared all over Paradise and that the \u2018Harmonious Wish\u2019 could be found inside.", "\u2018Dissonant Wish and Harmonious Wish\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu mulled over the two phrases. The participants of the Banquet had two opportunities to receive rewards. The interesting thing was that these rewards granted the participants\u2019 wishes.", "Of course, absurd wishes like \u2018Give me the entire world\u2019 didn\u2019t work, but even within a set limit, being able to obtain whatever one desired was incredibly alluring.", "\u2018I see why everyone is so heated up for the Banquet.\u2019", "With his interest piqued, Seol Jihu read through the remaining records. As his eyes went down, they became clouded with tension.", "\u300e\u2014First BanquetStage 3 Survivors: 8 / Escapees: 2 / Deaths: 0Special Note: One of the survivors, Phil Kanoo (Cameroon), announces receiving \u2018+4 Rampaging Fierce Longsword\u2019 as Stage 3 reward.", "\u2014Second BanquetStage 3 Survivors: 5 / Escapees: 4 / Deaths: 1Special Note: One of the survivors, Damv Nyam (Jamaica), advances to Level 5 immediately after the Banquet.", "\u2014Third BanquetStage 3 Survivors: 1 / Escapees: 1 / Deaths: 8Special Note: The sole survivor, Baek Haeju (Korea), kills everyone other than the sole escapee.

And besides, this one is a special Banquet.]", "[What about the Haramark Royal Family? I heard that they planned to ban Earthlings from participating in the Banquet after that incident.]", "[It\u2019s been canceled. The recent high death count among High Rankers seems to have affected their decision.]", "[\u201cIf you look at the distribution of participants, a vast majority of them are Level 4s. Almost everyone who is remotely decent will flock to this event.]", "Remembering the words he didn\u2019t understand back then, a corner of his heart turned cold. He didn\u2019t expect the Banquet to be easy, but the huge drop in the survival rate after the third Banquet was something he couldn\u2019t gloss over.", "\u2018But why?\u2019", "After thinking about the matter for a long time, Seol Jihu\u2019s curiosity suddenly approached the root of the problem.", "\u2018This Banquet\u2026.\u2019", "Who, what, when, where, why, how?", "Without a doubt, every Earthling who knew about the Banquet would have speculated about the same thing. But no one had a clear answer, with only theories and conjectures being known.", "Even Seol Jihu, who had solved one of Haramark\u2019s great mysteries, could not think of anything brilliant.", "\u2018Whatever.\u2019", "Seol Jihu organized the records and lied down on his bed.", "*", "Two days before the departure, Kazuki held a simple briefing. A detailed strategy couldn\u2019t be formed until the start of the Banquet, but the team wanted to at least make some preparations. They also needed to learn each other\u2019s faces.", "As such, a total of eight people gathered together. Among them, seven would be participating in the Banquet.", "On Carpe Diem\u2019s side were Seol Jihu, Hugo, Chohong, and the Priest Seol Jihu invited, Maria. On Umi Tsubame\u2019s side were Ayase Kazuki and\u2026", "\u201cO-su!\u201d", "A 170-centimeter-tall man whose hair was dyed red and puffed up like a lion\u2019s mane.", "\u201cMy name is Sakamoto Jun!\u201d", "The man introduced himself energetically before grabbing Seol Jihu\u2019s hands and vigorously shaking them up and down.", "Seol Jihu was taken aback. Translucent sunglasses, a casual Hawaiian shirt, wrinkly shorts, and sandals\u2026. How could he put it?\u2026. He felt like the man\u2019s attitude and clothes gave off the aura of a free spirit.", "\u201cHello, hello! You\u2019re one of the three rising stars who\u2019ve been the talk of Paradise, right? The First Star Warrior who gave up on becoming a Magician and even brushed aside Sinyoung!\u201d", "The man shoved his face up close before Seol Jihu could say anything. Exchanging glances at a nose-close distance, confusion set in Seol Jihu\u2019s face. Behind Sakatamo Jun\u2019s black sunglasses, his eyes were gleaming sharply like a wild beast.", "\u201cHyung-nim, let me tell you something just in case.\u201d", "\u201cHuh?\u201d", "\u201cI love bulgogi. I like kimchi too. I know most of Korea\u2019s famous athletes and I\u2019m a big fan of them.\u201d", "Jun quickly recited with a serious face. When Seol Jihu laughed and replied, \u2018Me too\u2019, his eyes widened and he smiled back cheerfully.", "\u201cIya~! Looks like I\u2019ll get along with Hyung-nim! Great, great. Ah, want one?\u201d", "He put his arm over Seol Jihu\u2019s shoulders and offered him a cigarette. Hugo, who was watching the exchange, went, \u201cMe too, me too!\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Hugo Hyung-nim. I heard you recently got yourself into a rough spot.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s been ages since then.

Frankly, given Jun\u2019s amiable personality, it wasn\u2019t surprising that he would get along with Hugo.", "Jun puffed out smoke before going \u201cOh, shoot!\u201d and hitting his forehead. He then offered Chohong his pack of cigarettes.", "\u201cI almost forgot about my Chung-dan Cho-dan Hong-dan noonim! Here, want one?\u201d", "\u201cShut up.\u201d", "\u201cOh, and it\u2019s been a while, Maria-chan~!\u201d", "\u201cShut up.\u201d", "\u201cChet. Aren\u2019t you too cold-hearted? Is it because you\u2019re in front of a celebrity? You\u2019re not mad because I tried to be friendly, are you?\u201d Jun mumbled like a machine gun.", "Chohong must have found him annoying because she massaged her neck and cut in.", "\u201cWhatever. Anyways, who\u2019s that?\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s chin pointed at the grey-robed person sitting quietly in the corner. The robe was large enough to have room left over after covering their entire body. Because this mysterious person also had the hood pushed down, his or her face wasn\u2019t visible. The entire outfit was screaming, \u2018I\u2019m a suspicious person!\u2019", "\u201cI dunno.\u201d Jun replied.", "\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you guys invite him\u2026 or her?\u201d", "\u201cW-We did, but\u2026.\u201d", "Jun shrugged his shoulders before turning his gaze. Kazuki, who was standing with his eyes closed and his back against the wall, finally opened his eyes.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a private circumstance.\u201d", "\u201cKazuki, I didn\u2019t know you liked telling jokes.\u201d Chohong growled with a face that seemed to say, \u2018Cut the crap\u2019.", "\u201cShe is an excellent Priest. I guarantee it.\u201d", "\u201cSo it\u2019s a she. Anyways, excellent Priest or not, you need to introduce her to us since she\u2019s going to be our comrade. At least get her to show her face.\u201d", "Seeing the Priest not say a word, Chohong laughed dumbfoundedly. \u201cOi, quit cosplaying as some dark religious fanatic and take off that hood.\u201d", "Kazuki\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cChung Chohong, watch your mouth.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cStop there.\u201d", "When Chohong shot up from her seat, Jang Maldong restrained her.

You\u2019re doing this too, Old Man?\u201d", "\u201cI told you to sit. I didn\u2019t tell you to not object.\u201d", "Hearing this, Chohong plopped down on the couch. Jang Maldong let out a short, dry cough before continuing calmly.", "\u201cKazuki, I can close my eyes if this team is going on an expedition, but it\u2019s a different story if it\u2019s the Banquet.\u201d", "Kazuki remained in thought. Everyone, including Kazuki, knew Chohong was justified in asking the Priest to introduce herself. After thinking about the matter for a long time, Kazuki let out a muffled sigh.", "\u201cShe was introduced to us by Lady Seo Yuhui.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cI guarantee this Priest\u2019s identity with my own name. Please understand! There is a complicated circumstance preventing us from revealing her identity.\u201d", "With Kazuki putting it this way, even Chohong found it hard to say anything.", "\u201c\u2026Fine, it\u2019s okay if she doesn\u2019t reveal her face. But let us hear her voice. She should be able to tell us her level at the very least, right?\u201d", "The Priest seemed to fall in thought. Soon, she bowed politely before carefully raising her gloved hand and holding up five fingers.", "Chohong stared at this and scowled. \u201cFucking hell. Is she for real? Hey, I\u2019m this too.\u201d", "She also held up five fingers, provoking the Priest. Kazuki pressed his temples and sent Seol Jihu a glance looking for help. Seol Jihu got up, unable to ignore his plea.", "\u201cChongchong.\u201d", "\u201cAh, what\u2026. Wait, what did you call me?\u201d", "When Chohong rebutted, Seol Jihu continued nonchalantly.", "\u201cKazuki went through a lot of trouble to invite her.\u201d", "\u201cI know that. So what did you just call me?\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s think positively. It\u2019s good to have two Priests.\u201d", "\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?

She won\u2019t even let us hear her voice! Argh, whatever, fuck it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s secret technique - changing the subject repeatedly.", "Chohong had a habit of giving up when a conversation got complicated. This was what Seol Jihu was aiming for.", "As if the entire conversation was a hassle, she harrumphed and buried herself in the couch again. That said, she made it clear that she wouldn\u2019t get along with the Priest.", "A few cracks appeared in the team atmosphere just from the first meeting, but Seol Jihu still greeted the Priest with a smile.", "\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Seol.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "Tilt.", "\u201cSeol. That\u2019s my name.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "Tilt. She tilted her head again.", "\u2018Can she not understand me?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head back.", "\u201cSince it looks like we\u2019re done with introductions\u2014\u201d The awful atmosphere eased slightly when Kazuki opened his mouth.", "\u201cLet us start.\u201d", "Kazuki looked back at the huge map hanging on the wall. He pointed at a specific location before continuing, \u201cI\u2019ll keep it simple. This is the entrance Hao Win handed over.\u201d", "\u201cQuestion!\u201d At that moment, Jun shouted with his hand up. \u201cHas it been confirmed?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cI heard that the Triads acquired two entrances, with one being used by the organization and the other being sold to another organization.\u201d", "He was asking this question since it was neither Carpe Diem nor Umi Tsubame that bought the other entrance.", "\u201cThat is only what\u2019s known to the public.\u201d", "Kazuki must have expected this question as he responded without a thought.", "\u201cThere are twenty-six entrances known to the public with twenty-one of them occupied by various forces.\u201d", "\u201cYou mean the Triads have entrances kept hidden from the public?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Triads. It\u2019s an open secret. Otherwise, there couldn\u2019t have been over 300 participants in the last Banquet.\u201d", "Jun immediately went \u201cAh.\u201d Since exactly ten people could enter each entrance, all it took was a simple calculation to know there were more entrances than what were publicly known.", "\u201cThe Triads have severe internal conflicts. Naturally, the person who found the new entrance has been keeping it a secret.\u201d", "\u201cAha, so that\u2019s how it is.\u201d", "Jun sat down, seemingly convinced. Kazuki continued the briefing. \u201cWe set off tomorrow morning. We\u2019ll be traveling by carriage for two days using this road.\u201d", "The pen in his hand drew a smooth, curved line.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll arrive at the Salt Desert\u2019s second oasis.

However, that only lasted a moment as she soon fell silent. Knowing how the Banquet worked, she knew they had nothing to lose by having more teams on their side.", "\u201cFinally\u2014\u201d Kazuki slowly continued, \u201cWe\u2019ll make a clear identification of friend or foe.\u201d", "*", "Not a single cloud was in the quiet sky, but Carpe Diem\u2019s office was buzzing with noise from early in the morning. Because Kazuki had set the departure time considerably early, they had to hurry before it was too late.", "After putting on his new equipment, Seol Jihu wore the belt carrying javelins and the medicine bottles he got from the hideout. Once he finished readying himself by putting on the robe given by the Federation, he went outside.", "Seol Jihu looked splendid in his new suit of armor, so much so that Hugo stared at him with a genuine look of envy. Unlike Seol Jihu, Hugo didn\u2019t have someone to gift him with a new set of armor. He had to scrape up what little money he had saved up to buy new armor and weapon. Even then, he had to make compromises.", "Because of this, he was determined to use this Banquet as an opportunity to make a fortune.", "Just before their departure\u2026", "\u201cBe careful.\u201d", "\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d", "\u201cWith your current abilities, you won\u2019t die easily, but that\u2019s it.

Seol Jihu also agreed that it was the best thing to do. Just as he sped up his pace\u2026.", "\u201cHere! Here!", "He found Sakamoto Jun, waving his hand from a distance. By the looks of it, Umi Tsubame had already arrived.", "\u201cNow, sorry for rushing you when you just arrived, but we gotta hurry. Hyung-nim and Noonim, ride with me.

Makes sense, right?\u201d", "Jun gave a rapid-fire explanation before pushing Seol Jihu and Chohong to the carriage. There was already someone sitting inside\u2014 the Priest Kazuki invited.

Where else would he lead his team this early in the morning when the Banquet was just at the doorstep?", "\u201cHold on.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was nodding his head when he suddenly arrived at a frightening conclusion.", "\u201cCould they possibly\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cHyung-nim, I know what you\u2019re thinking. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d", "Jun smiled and shook his head.", "\u201cAs I said, those people aren\u2019t idiots.

But seeing that Seol Jihu didn\u2019t laugh, he let out a dry cough and once again put on a serious face.", "\u201cNow that I think about it, this is Hyung-nim\u2019s first Banquet, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cThen I guess the shock might be too great. Brace yourself.\u201d", "\u201cJun, cut the nonsense.\u201d", "Chohong was listening quietly but chose to cut in here.", "\u201cNonsense? Noonim, this is valuable advice.\u201d", "\u201cCut the bullshit.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re so mean.\u201d", "Jun dropped his head dejectedly but quickly regained his energy.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing special, but\u2026 Hyung-nim, you\u2019ve been doing well in a good team ever since you entered Paradise.\u201d", "He wasn\u2019t wrong.

That was because Chohong\u2019s glaring eyes were getting stronger by the second.", "\u201cGeez, you don\u2019t have to be so protective of him. Anyways, as a senpai who participated in the last Banquet, let me give you a piece of advice\u2026.\u201d Jun took a brief pause before saying with a grin, \u201cDon\u2019t expect too much.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t expect too much?\u201d Seol Jihu immediately asked back.", "\u201cYep. The more you expect, the more disappointed you will be. On the contrary, if you don\u2019t expect anything, you can\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d", "What did he mean by that?", "\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough, but to explain it simply\u2026 the moment you go through the entrance, you\u2019ll get to meet all sorts of people.\u201d", "His voice became quieter.", "\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that you shouldn\u2019t be too disappointed. With humans.\u201d", "With a grin, Jun stopped talking.", "\u2018Don\u2019t be disappointed\u2026 with humans?\u2019", "It was ambiguous, though he felt like he could understand the gist. With a short sigh, Seol Jihu looked out of the window once again. There were still dozens of carriages following them from behind.", "If there was one thing that caught his attention, it would be that the carriages each had huge distances between them.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Looking at them, he couldn\u2019t help but think, \u2018Maybe, for them, the Banquet has already started.\u2019"]}
