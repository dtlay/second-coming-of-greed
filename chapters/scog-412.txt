Out of the blue.\u201d", "Then, he grinned.", "\u201cIt\u2019s ironic, isn\u2019t it?

If that happened, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to enjoy the happiness I have now.\u201d", "Vlad Halep made an awkward face as if he was embarrassed to say the word \u2018happiness\u2019.", "By now, Seol Jihu had calmed down significantly. What Vlad Halep was suggesting played a big part.", "Thinking about it, he and Vlad Halep had a few things in common: being involved in many incidents and accidents, being targeted by a mysterious enemy, and so on.", "In this sense, Vlad Halep was his senior.", "That wasn\u2019t all. Seol Jihu felt the same strangeness at Vlad Halep\u2019s story, and it was something he had felt before too when he read the records Ian wrote about renowned Earthlings who met unfortunate ends.", "Once he thought this far, his head cleared up.", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bowed politely.", "His heart had been charred black with rage on his way to the building, but thanks to Vlad Halep, his reason came back, his head cooling down.", "Vlad Halep stared at Seol Jihu expressing his gratitude before looking away and sipping on his coffee.", "\u201cWell\u2026 let me know if there\u2019s anything I can help with.
