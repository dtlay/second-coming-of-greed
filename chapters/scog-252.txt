And when he saw a group of Earthlings being dragged in one after the other, he became lost for words.", "The members of Royal Pattaya were bound up and showing dazed expressions, dozens of haggardly Federation members were expressing their anger behind them, and one young man remained silent within this uproar.", "It was true.", "He was half in doubt when he first received the news. But now that he saw the truth with his own eyes, Sorg K\u00fchne was struck with an indescribable emotion.", "If he had to describe it, it would be\u2026 delight.", "\u2018That Earthling\u2026\u2019", "He\u2019s real.", "It was only a few months ago that he declared he would pull out Eva\u2019s deeply-rooted evils, but he had gouged them out entirely.

Looking at her, he immediately noticed that the edges of her eyelids were red.", "Sorg K\u00fchne stared fixedly at the woman, who had a hood pulled down deep. Kim Hannah bowed respectfully.", "\u201cWe\u2019re ashamed to cause such trouble on the very day we moved in.\u201d", "\u201cYou really caught me by surprise. To think you would strike on the first day\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWe admit that what we did was a little tough. But it was all to follow Her Royal Highness\u2019 will and to protect Eva\u2019s law. It had to be done.\u201d", "Kim Hannah mentioned the law, appealing their case.", "This incident had already happened. How the matter was handled from now on would determine the intensity of the aftermath. Before then, Kim Hannah needed to prepare a secret hill to rely on.", "Sorg K\u00fchne wasn\u2019t a fool, understanding Kim Hannah\u2019s intentions fully. The royal administrator had the authority to meet her expectations.", "\u201cI already heard the backstory.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne said with a hoarse voice.", "\u201cI trust that you have solid evidence?\u201d", "\u201cWe spared\u2026 no, detained ten members. We liberated all the foreign races held captive in the auction house and brought them here.\u201d", "\u201cUm\u2026\u201d", "At that moment, the soldier cut in carefully.", "\u201cWe just received a report about a basement in Royal Pattaya\u2019s building.\u201d", "\u201cBasement?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Um\u2026 it apparently had corpses of foreign races on display\u2026\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne\u2019s expression contorted. But soon, he regained his composure and nodded his head.", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to see then.

Depending on how we frame the incident\u2026\u201d", "As Sorg K\u00fchne murmured to himself, Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes flickered with light.", "Sorg K\u00fchne walked past her and stopped in front of Seol Jihu, who was sitting on his knees silently.", "\u201cPlease leave.\u201d", "Seemingly random words came out. Seol Jihu looked up at Sorg K\u00fchne.", "\u201cThis place is where criminals come. Non-criminals do not belong here. We\u2019ve heard your testimony, so you can go now.\u201d", "Sorg K\u00fchne stared at him for a moment.", "Understanding his intent, Seol Jihu stood up. As he was being treated as a testifier and not a criminal, he wasn\u2019t bound up in the first place.", "After giving a bow, Seol Jihu turned around and headed to the door. Sorg K\u00fchne blankly stared at the young man\u2019s back as he walked away.", "[One of the reasons I\u2019m trying to relocate to Eva is to improve humanity\u2019s relationship with the Federation.]", "[The main character of that game said this: evil is evil.]", "[Lesser, greater, middling\u2026 makes no difference.

He had to fight with him, take the blow for him, and protect his back when he wasn\u2019t looking. Sorg K\u00fchne knew this better than anyone else.", "Eva had long been suffering from an illness, slowly rotting away from the core. But finally, a saving grace had appeared.", "If he missed this opportunity, he would regret it for a lifetime.", "Sorg K\u00fchne clenched his fists.", "\u2018Come to think of it, during the Haramark incident\u2026\u2019", "Sorg K\u00fchne investigated the intelligence report before calling a soldier over.", "\u201cGo give the Assassination Guild a visit.\u201d", "*", "Light was leaking out of the first floor of Carpe Diem\u2019s new building.

It meant they had only completed the first step in a series of important processes.", "\u201cWe attacked the auction house, freed the Federation\u2019s foreign races, and attacked Royal Pattaya in the process of rescuing an already sold Sky Fairy.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d", "With that, the two of them fell silent. They both looked like they had a lot to say and a lot to hear. But Jang Maldong massaged his nose bridge and nodded calmly.", "\u201cIt must have been hard. Go get some sleep.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yes, you should catch some sleep too, Master.\u201d", "Seol Jihu quietly walked up the stairs without explaining every little detail. Only then did the other members scatter one by one.", "Chohong and Hugo followed Seol Jihu, complaining about lack of sleep, while Maria and Phi Sora walked down to the basement, saying they would check out the hot spring.", "Only Marcel Ghionea stayed and sat down on the couch. Turning to the entrance, he took out a white crossbow.", "Jang Maldong gave him a strange look as he looked ready to fight, and feeling his gaze, Marcel Ghionea spoke.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just to be safe.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cWe crushed Royal Pattaya beyond recovery. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other organizations in Eva.\u201d", "Jang Maldong went, \u201cAh.\u201d", "An Archer had to take every possibility into account, no matter how unlikely it was. In this sense, Marcel Ghionea was truly worthy of his title, Archer of Steel.", "\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve stayed up for four nights without sleep. You should go catch some sleep, Master.\u201d", "Jang Maldong grinned.", "\u201cGood work. I\u2019ll leave you to it then.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea loaded the crossbow with bolts and replied calmly.", "\u201cNo problem.\u201d", "*", "When Seol Jihu opened his eyes, the sun was already in the middle of the sky. But even after waking up, Seol Jihu stayed in bed for a while.", "Lying there in a daze, the things he\u2019d done last night flashed through his mind quickly. Although only a few hours had gone by since then, last night\u2019s memories felt like a dream.", "Suddenly raising his upper body, Seol Jihu looked down at his hands.", "Last night, he had killed people with these hands. Several people.", "\u2018\u2026It\u2019s the same.\u2019", "He still didn\u2019t feel a single thing. Even though he killed other human beings, not a hint of guilt or torment was felt.", "Seol Jihu was entirely calm, both physically and mentally, so much so that he felt it was strange.", "But if there was one thing that remained on his mind, it was Sombat La-ongmanee.", "Of course, Seol Jihu thought La-ongmanee fully deserved everything that had been done to him. But at the same time, he knew his usual self wouldn\u2019t have gone to such lengths.", "Something inside of him had snapped, almost as if he had been possessed.", "\u2018Future Vision definitely didn\u2019t activate.\u2019", "This ability had a side-effect of making him lose his memory during the time the skill was active. But he clearly remembered last night\u2019s events.", "\u2018Maybe it\u2019s because of Future Vision\u2019s influence\u2026?\u2019", "Do I have bipolar disorder or something? Murmuring inwardly, Seol Jihu sighed and looked around.", "Then, he made a dumbfounded expression. He realized a part of the reason he felt so out of place.", "His room was simply too different from the one he had in Haramark.", "\u2018This is going to take some getting used to.\u2019", "Seol Jihu laughed faintly before clenching his fists. Then, he hopped off the soft bed and walked forward on the even softer carpet.", "Although he walked in a somewhat stately manner, he faltered the moment he opened the door.", "The new building\u2019s complex, grand inner structure overwhelmed him instantly. In the old building, all he had to do was leave the dorm and sit down on the couch.", "\u2018You really should have built this place in moderation, Kim Hannah.\u2019", "Looking around here and there, Seol Jihu finally found a map and went up to the tenth-floor cafeteria.", "Unexpectedly, someone else was already there.", "Kim Hannah was reading a report while drinking coffee in her usual business attire.", "\u201cYou just woke up?\u201d", "Kim Hannah asked without taking her eyes off the report.

If you\u2019re up, hurry up and sit your ass down. You can clown around later.\u201d", "Kim Hannah was still drinking her coffee in an elegant manner, not giving Seol Jihu a single glance.", "Seol Jihu shrugged and walked over. Only then did Kim Hannah put the paper in her hand down, giving him a pitying look.", "\u201cDo you really need to do that right after waking up?\u201d", "\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 What are you reading?\u201d", "Unable to come up with a good response, Seol Jihu changed the subject. Kim Hannah shook her head, then looked down at the paper again.", "\u201cThe intelligence report from the Assassination Guild.\u201d", "A smile of satisfaction spread on her face.", "\u201cSorg K\u00fchne. That old man dealt with this problem fantastically. I almost feel like I received an unexpected gift.\u201d", "\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d", "Instead of answering, Kim Hannah gave him the paper. Seol Jihu took it immediately.", "The headline said this:", "\u2014The Hubbub of Crimes and Unlawful Activities, The VIP Auction House and Royal Pattaya", "The report detailed the illegal activities carried out by the VIP auction house, and the brutality of Royal Pattaya\u2019s leader, Sombat La-ongmanee.", "It also contained a quote from Sorg K\u00fchne, \u201cAll Earthlings arrested and held captive shall be executed in accordance with Eva\u2019s law.

There aren\u2019t any lies in this report, and it\u2019s also easy to get behind saying that people who committed crimes are in the wrong.\u201d", "Seol Jihu immediately understood the deeper meaning.", "What if the report portrayed Seol Jihu as a hero? What if it reported the truth exactly as it happened?", "His fame might go up, but at the same time, some people would also see him in a hostile light.", "\u2018I learned that during that incident in Haramark.\u2019", "There was a bigger chance of that happening with this specific incident. Previously, his attackers had tried to blemish his name immediately after he returned victorious from a huge battle against the Parasites. This time, Seol Jihu had attacked other Earthlings.", "Kim Hannah continued.", "\u201cSimply put, he\u2019s taking on the role of being the punching bag.

Anyway, I\u2019m glad you understand. I was worried you\u2019d be mad about your achievement being stolen.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed.", "\u201cAchievement? Please.\u201d", "Kim Hannah gave an insipid smile.", "\u201cPeople will find out that we were behind it anyway. The other organizations already know, I\u2019m sure.\u201d", "Kim Hannah then took out several pieces of paper from her handbag.", "\u201cWanna see? It\u2019s the piece of paper news that came out before noon today. It\u2019s mostly about you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d", "\u201cOh? You don\u2019t care?\u201d", "\u201cWhy would I?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shrugged.", "\u201cLet them bark all they want. I have a lot to do, and I\u2019m busy taking care of my own people. It would be a waste of time worrying about people who hate me.\u201d", "\u201cOoh~\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I committed some crime against humanity or praised the Parasites. People who are badmouthing me are probably just unhappy with me. Let them be. I\u2019m going to continue doing my own thing.\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu speak so fluently, Kim Hannah gave a faint smile.", "Seol Jihu had really changed after going through so many ordeals. A leader of an organization had to be daring and unshakeable.", "Although Kim Hannah had her worries, she liked the current Seol Jihu a thousand times more than the past Seol Jihu who didn\u2019t know where to even begin.", "\u201cI\u2019m curious what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d", "\u201cWe have to go hit them, of course.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke simply.", "\u201cI found out yesterday just how messed up Eva is.

I bet that old man, Sorg K\u00fchne, made these decisions on his own without even telling the queen. He\u2019s prepared to be rebuked. Though, maybe this isn\u2019t something he would get rebuked over.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThink about it. You wreaked havoc under the pretense of carrying out the law, and the highest royal administrator, who\u2019s been biding his time, finally took action.

At least, not for now.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head bitterly.", "\u201cThey would be doing their best to cover their tracks while collecting as much information as possible. Do you think they\u2019d continue their illegal activities as if nothing happened? I don\u2019t think so. They\u2019ll either be more secretive or halt their operations for a while.\u201d", "In other words, barging into their organization building like last night to acquire evidence would be unlikely to work. Unless they were idiots, it was more likely that they would dig traps and wait for them. If that happened, Carpe Diem would be the one in a tough spot.", "Fully acknowledging that this made sense, Seol Jihu smacked his lips and crossed his arms.", "\u201cCome to think of it, didn\u2019t you say that we could only worry about our next move after crushing Royal Pattaya?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m surprised you remember.\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked away subtly.", "\u201cAre you sure?

You have a good idea?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu asked, Kim Hannah\u2019s smile became thicker.", "\u201cI do, I do.\u201d", "Her eyes curled to crescent moon shapes before scintillating with crafty light that resembled the night sky\u2019s moon.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there are just a couple of organizations.
