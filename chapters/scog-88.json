Back then, he didn't think too deeply about it, but who knew that the gold color would come back to him in this manner?", "\u201cIn any case, it was quite a bizarre thing.\u201d ", "The Fallen Angel lightly tossed the bluish stone up and down repeatedly before muttering to herself.", "\u201cWhat was?\u201d ", "\u201cI'm talking about the plan to mass-produce the mutated species. In order to disrupt that plan, we had to destroy the laboratory within the Delpinion Duchy. The other facilities aren't as important.

Right now, the story was roughly the same regardless of which part of the border region they got to. If they couldn't find any other way, the situation called for them to attempt a forceful breakthrough anyway. So, doing it this way might give them a better chance. In theory, the percentage of their survival would increase, even if that increase was smaller than a teardrop of a newborn chick.", "\u201cJudging by your plan, I guess you two hold important positions within the Federation that require you to go back no matter what, correct?\u201d", "\u201cWe don't have a reason to let you in on that.
