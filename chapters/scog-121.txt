Assuming each labyrinth had eight people, that means at least 320 participated in this year\u2019s Banquet\u2026.\u201d As the end of his sentence trailed off, his expression turned more and more sour.", "\u201c36 teams made it up so far, so 288 people should be here.\u201d", "\u201cRight, but they might have\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI know. But don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too harsh for only 165 people to have made it up here?\u201d", "Seol Jihu swallowed his saliva. Over half of the participants had perished or had been eliminated in Stage 1?", "\u201cThere are still four teams left. I can only hope he\u2019s just been eliminated.\u201d", "Kazuki smiled bitterly before asking for another cigarette. In response, Seol Jihu dazedly handed him the entire pack.", "\u201cAnyways, I heard you did well. The second team to make it up here, right?\u201d", "\u201cWho told you that?\u201d", "\u201cAn Archer named Lara Wolff. She was praising you so much that I began to worry her tongue would dry up.\u201d", "Kazuki seemed to have gone around to exchange information the moment he came up. Seol Jihu silently regretted just sitting around and doing nothing.", "Meanwhile, Kazuki glanced at the young man and saw his complexion sink.", "\u201c\u2026Not really,\u201d The young man muttered in a gloomy voice.", "Kazuki tilted his head. From what he heard about the young man\u2019s feats, he should have no reason to feel dejected.", "\u201cDid something happen?\u201d", "Seol Jihu hesitated for a long time. Then\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026Leading people is really hard, huh.\u201d He finally let out the sigh he had been holding in. \u201cThings don\u2019t work out the way you want. To be honest, I can\u2019t even remember what I did.\u201d", "Kazuki must have been caught off guard as his eyes widened with a cigarette still hanging between his lips. However, that only lasted a moment.", "\u201cYep.\u201d", "As the leader of Umi Tsubame, he couldn\u2019t help but agree with the young man\u2019s statement.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. It is hard. After all, you have to unite people who aren\u2019t like you and people who aren\u2019t like each other.\u201d", "\u201cTough, huh\u2026.\u201d", "The reason Seol Jihu was so troubled was that he didn\u2019t know what to do. He didn\u2019t have regrets. Not a single thought of \u2018I should have done this or I should have done that\u2019 entered his mind.", "Because of this, he couldn\u2019t make any excuses. Even if he went back in time and restarted Stage 1 with the knowledge he had now, he wasn\u2019t confident in bringing about a result better than this one.", "\u201cMister Kazuki.\u201d", "\u201cMm?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to say too.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll consider it payment for this pack of cigarettes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu confessed his frustrations at Kazuki, who was a well-respected leader. Perhaps the young man wanted someone to listen to him, agree with him, and offer some advice.", "Kazuki listened to the young man silently before saying, \u201cMaybe the clothes didn\u2019t fit you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head in confusion.", "\u201cIf I were you\u2026\u201d Kazuki continued immediately, \u201cI would have revealed my identity first.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cThere is value in the name Carpe Diem. Plus, your name is a topic in itself.\u201d", "\u201cThey might think I\u2019m just being cocky.\u201d", "\u201cOnly if you introduce yourself arrogantly. Depending on your attitude or the situation, things might have gone in a different direction.\u201d Kazuki snorted. \u201cThe method you used to lead the six members of the group is persuasion. In other words, a gift of gab.\u201d", "\u201cR\u2026 right.\u201d", "\u201cWords have different weights depending on who says them. The words of a famous, authoritative person are different than the words of a nameless brat.\u201d Kazuki muttered endlessly. \u201cAnd fame is the strongest card in your possession. What\u2019s wrong about using something you\u2019ve built up fair and square?\u201d", "Seol Jihu became speechless at Kazuki\u2019s logical reasoning.", "\u201cIt\u2019s only a guess, but had you revealed your identity at the beginning, their attitude might have changed. At the very least, they wouldn\u2019t have looked down on you.\u201d", "\u201cIs that really the case?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I did.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "\u201cYou need to know your value a bit more,\u201d Kazuki smirked as he saw the young man\u2019s look of disbelief. \u201cWell, despite me saying this\u2026 I don\u2019t think what you did was bad.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "\u201cYou said Oh Rahee and the Viper, or rather Audrey Basler, were in your party, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cWith those two\u2026 well\u2026\u201d Kazuki took a careful look around before speaking quietly, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been strange even if the team was torn to pieces. You did a good job just coming out in one piece.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu trembled, feeling like he just heard something terrifying. \u201cDo you know them?\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d Kazuki\u2019s face seemed to say, \u2018How would I not know them?\u2019", "\u201cOh Rahee is a High Ranker, but she was famous even before she became one. She has a few infamous tales, so look into them if you\u2019re curious.\u201d", "\u201cCan\u2019t you just tell me? You can just summarize them.\u201d", "\u201cFiguratively speaking, she has the battle prowess of the God of War Zhao Yun, and the intelligence and political power of Sima Yi.\u201d", "Hearing Kazuki compare her to two of the most famous generals in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Seol Jihu dropped his jaw. He asked, \u201cHow could there be such a cheat character?\u201d", "However, Kazuki was dead serious.", "\u201cWhat\u2026 what about Audrey Basler?\u201d", "\u201cShe is someone I would never pick to be a member of my team.\u201d Kazuki spoke firmly, \u201cIf I were in your position, I would have either killed her, or abandoned her. I wouldn\u2019t have considered any other option.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cBecause my life could be in danger if I let her be.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head, but when he remembered Snake Eyes\u2019 color, he immediately agreed. Even as he was progressing through the labyrinth, he was more wary of Basler than Oh Rahee.", "\u201cStill, to say you\u2019d kill her\u2026. Isn\u2019t there a way to bring her along?\u201d", "\u201cSeol.\u201d Kazuki sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not a murderous psychopath. I\u2019m not saying I would kill for no reason. However, I also don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right. Since you managed to pull it off, I won\u2019t say you\u2019re soft either.\u201d Kazuki spoke sharply.", "Then\u2026. \u201cBut\u2026 your method might have been the right one for Stage 1.\u201d He muttered with a voice carrying a hint of regret.", "It was then. Ruffle, ruffle. The surroundings suddenly got noisy.", "\u201cOne?\u201d", "Kazuki doubted his eyes. On one of the remaining stairways, a long-haired man climbed up to the mountaintop. He seemed to be about 2 meters tall, and his stature was also huge.", "The problem was that he was plastered in blood. It was so much that even fresh blood was dripping down from the ends of his hair. His demon-like appearance made the surrounding people back off in shock.", "Furthermore, the moment the man climbed up to the mountaintop, the 40 pillars emitted brilliant beams of light. The beams all shot toward the middle before forming a cluster.", "Something was finally appearing above the empty mountaintop. In other words\u2026.", "\u201cA portal, huh.\u201d", "Stage 1 had officially ended.", "\u201cMister Kazuki.\u201d Seol Jihu asked as he watched other people gather around the glimmering light in groups, \u201cThere\u2019s another thing I\u2019m curious about.\u201d", "\u201cIf it\u2019s just one, go ahead.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you mean when you said the clothes didn\u2019t fit me?\u201d", "\u201cI meant you should take off your mask.\u201d Kazuki replied immediately.", "\u2018Mask?\u2019 Seol Jihu touched his face. What was Kazuki talking about?", "\u201cWhat kind of a leader do I look like to you?\u201d", "Hearing the sudden question, Seol Jihu pondered before saying, \u201cMm\u2026. A cold, level-hearted leader who does everything that needs to be done?\u201d", "\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t answer right away, but he had a reason for this assessment.", "Back in the rescue mission, Kazuki had found his younger sister after all sorts of hardships. However, he had cut her down without a shred of hesitation. This blade-like coldness left a powerful impression on Seol Jihu, who was shaken quite a lot at the time.", "\u201cJust like how each individual differs, leaders have their own styles.\u201d", "\u201cRight.\u201d", "\u201cYou tried to lead people with words, but that wasn\u2019t the method that fit you.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIn my eyes, you\u2019re not the \u2018eloquent orator\u2019 type or the \u2018cunning strategist\u2019 type. No, you\u2019re more the instinctive type.\u201d", "He wore a calm expression, and his voice carried strength behind his words.", "\u201cYou should find a style that suits your nature. You know, wear the clothes that fit you.\u201d", "After saying this, Kazuki got up. The portal had been fully opened, and people were entering it one by one.", "\u201cNature\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cYep. Do you remember? When you shoved your spear at my neck on Huge Stone Rocky Mountain.\u201d", "\u201cThat was\u2014\u201d", "\u201cIn my eyes\u2014\u201d Kazuki twisted his body halfway and glanced back at the young man, \u201cThat state of madness you showed me is closer to your true self.\u201d He smirked and then walked towards the portal.", "\u2018A style that suits my nature?\u2019 Seol Jihu looked at his Status Window and made a troubled expression.", "\u2018A chaotic leader is a bit\u2026\u2019 He smacked his lips before standing up with his spear.", "Just as he was about to follow Kazuki\u2014", "\u2018Huh?\u2019", "His chaotic mind suddenly became relaxed like a tranquil lake. It felt like the worries filling his head had all been washed away. It was a mystifying feeling. He had only exchanged a few words, but his body and mind had become more stable.", "Seol Jihu came to realize something then.", "\u2018So this is why \u2018short-tempered\u2019 doesn\u2019t go away.\u2019", "One should never expect to get full with the first bite, and one needed more than pearls to make a necklace.", "Dylan and Kazuki couldn\u2019t have been well-respected leaders from the start. As Seol Jihu was only 26 years old, expecting to be on the same level as them would be too greedy.", "\u2018Right.\u2019", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t a full-fledged leader yet. He had only taken his first step. He had many things to experience and many things to learn. Today\u2019s failure would only be one of the countless failures of the future.", "When he thought about things this way, not only did he stop feeling so complicated, but even courage welled up inside him.", "\u2018In Stage 2\u2026.\u2019", "He didn\u2019t expect to be perfect. But he could try to do better by using the experience he gained from Stage 1\u2019s failure.", "Seol Jihu tightened his grip around his Ice Spear. Then, he confidently stepped towards the portal.", "His heart began to pound once again.", "*", "The white light blocking his vision slowly dissipated. Seol Jihu checked his surroundings the moment he opened his eyes.", "Thankfully, he wasn\u2019t separated from his teammates like in Stage 1. He could see both Chohong and Hugo. This was surely good news, but he could also see over a hundred others.", "\u2018165\u2026 no, 166.\u2019 After remembering the bloodied man who walked up at the end, Seol Jihu slowly walked forward. He was about to sneak up to Chohong and poke her side when he felt someone tug at the hem of his clothes.", "Glancing back, he saw Maria pulling on him.", "\u201cStay still.\u201d", "\u201cHuh?\u201d", "\u201cThe atmosphere is weird,\u201d Maria whispered.", "Seol Jihu looked around the area once again. Indeed, something seemed off. He couldn\u2019t quite put it into words, but the air felt strangely heavy.", "Even Chohong\u2019s eyes were gleaming with a cold light. It was the same with Hugo. Their usual cheerful appearances were nowhere to be seen, and they were staring blankly into the air with the eyes of a hunter searching for prey.", "Plus, they weren\u2019t the only ones like this. Everybody he saw seemed to be seriously infuriated, adding to the area\u2019s hostile atmosphere.", "It didn\u2019t take long for him to realize something must have happened during Stage 1.", "\u2018Wait!\u2019", "He remembered that he started to feel bad after Stage 1 ended. If he didn\u2019t vent his pent-up frustration by talking with Kazuki, he wouldn\u2019t have been any different than the people here.", "\u2018This place\u2026.\u2019", "When he activated his Nine Eyes and looked around the area, he couldn\u2019t hide his shock.", "He was in a meadow, an open field where green grass gently swayed from a light breeze. All of the remaining 166 participants had been thrown into this vast plain.", "Of course, the grass wasn\u2019t the only thing here. At a spot close to where they were teleported, there were two large holes about 2 meters in diameter. They were about 10 meters away from each other, and a rectangular stone stele was standing between them.", "And above this stone stele was a familiar object \u2014 a giant hourglass.", "\u2018What is that?\u2019", "People, who likewise finished surveying the area, either approached the stone stele or watched it attentively. It was then\u2026", "DING\u2014!", "An intense pain struck Seol Jihu\u2019s head, similar to when he went through Synchronization. Muffled groans rang out from the surroundings, but the strange phenomenon only lasted a moment.", "Seol Jihu was pressing his temples when he realized that information he didn\u2019t have before was etched in his brain, and his eyes widened.", "\u2018Information was\u2026 planted in my brain?\u2019", "Clearly, previously unknown information had been forced into everyone\u2019s brains. But as Seol Jihu had experienced something similar before, he wasn\u2019t too taken aback.", "He closed his eyes and focused on the new information.", "[1. The Plaza of Sacrifice (Left)]Activation Condition: At least 6 people must enter.Difficulty: Static\u2014Exit blocked once entered.\u2014Exit automatically opened once all enemies eliminated or no challengers remain.", "[2. The Plaza of the Dissonant Wish (Right)]Activation Condition: The Activation of the Plaza of Sacrifice\u2014Activated every time the Plaza of Sacrifice is activated. At most 6 people can enter.\u2014Can acquire the Dissonant Wish\u2014Stepping on the red portal on top of the altar will transport the challenger to Stage 3 or Paradise. Leaving through the exit will return them to Stage 2.", "[3. Miscellaneous]\u201410 people can enter Stage 3.\u2014Successfully defeating the Plaza of Sacrifice 20 times will permanently activate the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish and disable the entree limit (All can enter).", "After reading all the information available, Seol Jihu muttered out, \u2018God damn it.\u2019", "There were several conditions to worry about, but the general nuance of the stage seemed to lie on getting to the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish. The question, of course, was \u2018how\u2019.", "Frankly speaking, it was clear what these dirty conditions were trying to say.", "Tang! Suddenly, a harsh crashing sound rang out.", "The information was not finished. There was one condition left in the Miscellaneous section.", "[If the Plaza of Sacrifice is not activated before the hourglass\u2019s sand completely trickles down, a huge group of monsters will appear in the field.]", "Seol Jihu opened his eyes. He began to see sand falling from the overturned hourglass.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Everyone\u2019s faces contorted viciously as they stared at the stone stele.", "A deadly silence ensued.", "Sssss-!", "While only the sound of sand trickling down rang out\u2026.", "\u201cS-Shouldn\u2019t we hurry inside?\u201d", "A voice from somewhere made everyone stare at each other. The Timing Game had begun the moment the sand began to fall."]}
