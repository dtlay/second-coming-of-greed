There was a huge backlog of unread messages and missed phone calls. The problem was that they all came from the same person.", "[Damn it. Just you wait until I see you again.]", "Imagining a seething Phi Sora typing this message, Seol Jihu guffawed and took his clothes off. Then, he headed to the bathroom, humming.", "Today was the day to return to Paradise. As he had been waiting for this day for so long, he was naturally in a good mood.", "After washing every inch of his body, Seol Jihu prepared to go back refreshed. As he had finished most of the preparations last night, all he was doing was a final check-up.", "First, he had to arrange a good background story. As such, he messaged Seol Wooseok.", "[I have a business trip.]", "[Again? Didn\u2019t you say you just finished a huge project?]", "[Director Kim is the type to come up with work even if there isn\u2019t any.]", "[Ah, I think I know what you mean.]", "[Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be working overseas so I might not be back for a while, but once I do, I\u2019ll have most of my debts paid off.]", "[Okay. I understand you wanting to pay your debts back as soon as possible, but don\u2019t sacrifice your health. Take some vitamins, if anything.]", "A pleased smile bloomed on Seol Jihu\u2019s face as he read the message. He wanted to talk more, but he knew Seol Wooseok must be busy preparing to go to work.", "Thinking that this was enough, Seol Jihu plugged his phone to the charger. After grabbing some freshly washed clothes from the drying rack, he put them on, ate a banana for breakfast, then checked the items he was bringing to Paradise.", "\u201cLet\u2019s see, red ginseng for Master Jang\u2026 a present for Yuhui Noona\u2026 presents for Princess and Flone\u2026 something to tease Miss Phi Sora about\u2026.\u201d", "Throwing the banana peel into the trash, the check-up was drawing to an end.

Oh, yeah.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu stepped back, Yoo Seonhwa walked in and gently took her shoes off.", "\u201cIt\u2019s cleaner than I thought\u2026\u201d", "She sounded somewhat regretful.", "\u201cWhat about breakfast? I thought you wouldn\u2019t have eaten yet, so\u2014\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa raised the shopping bag in her hand and waved it slightly.

I\u2019m feeling it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t expect her to say yes but hurriedly brought the banana over.

He blinked his eyes, feeling his heart pounding under his palm.", "\u201cI heard.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa spoke with her back turned to Seol Jihu, still taking out the banana peels from the trash can.", "\u201cYou\u2019re employed now and paying back your debts?\u201d", "\u201cHow did you know?\u201d", "\u201cWooseok Oppa told me.\u201d", "\u201cHyung told you?\u201d", "Didn\u2019t I tell him he didn\u2019t need to persuade anyone? No, maybe he just let Seonhwa know without any ulterior motive. That this is how I\u2019m living now. I\u2019m sure he had to say something to explain paying off the debt with my money.", "Seol Jihu decided not to be too forward.", "\u201cAunty was really happy when she heard you got into Sinyoung. She said her son was pulled up from a quagmire.\u201d", "What about Father and Jinhee?", "Seol Jihu held himself back from asking.

She didn\u2019t say he did well or ask about the job, but was asking whether his body was okay?", "Just as he was thinking that she was asking about the wrong thing\u2014", "\u201cWooseok Oppa said that you work late every day and even go on business trips. Make sure they pay you every cent you work for!\u201d", "\u201cOh, of course.\u201d", "Seol Jihu accepted the strangeness thinking, \u2018They sure talked about all sorts of things.\u2019", "\u201cYeah, my body\u2019s fine.

Her clear eyes turned a bit sour. The way a chilling air emanated from her, she seemed to be glaring at him.", "\u201cWhew.\u201d", "Huh? Isn\u2019t this what happens before she lectures me?", "Seol Jihu scratched his head, wondering what he did wrong now.", "Gulp. Yoo Seonhwa forcefully swallowed hard before collecting her breath and speaking out.", "\u201cI came to tell you something.\u201d", "It was finally time. Seol Jihu gave his undivided attention to Yoo Seonhwa as his chest tighten from extreme nervousness.", "\u201cIt\u2019s about the money you gave me\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s your money.\u201d", "Seol Jihu cut her off, clearly revealing that he did not want the money back.

I had to take out some loans and I\u2019m not sure how well it will go, but since I don\u2019t have to pay rent or key money, it won\u2019t go out of business at the very least.\u201d", "\u201cOh, congrats!\u201d", "He wasn\u2019t sure why she suddenly brought up this topic but congratulated her from the bottom of his heart.", "\u2018She must have a lot of money.\u2019", "At this time, he was only surprised and didn\u2019t have other thoughts. But that changed when he heard her next few words.", "\u201cDo you want to do it together?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "Completely caught off guard, a look of disbelief quickly took over Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly large shop.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa continued softly with a calm expression.", "\u201cIt\u2019s downtown near four universities. It will be pretty hard by myself, so I want you to help.\u201d", "\u201cSe-Seonhwa?\u201d", "\u201cYou just have to manage the employees, so it won\u2019t be too difficult.

If you want, I can put your name down as a co-owner. I can say that the money you gave me was an investment.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa spoke her mind in a while-we\u2019re-at-it kind of way. By now, Seol Jihu had gone beyond the point of being dumbfounded to being shell-shocked.", "Setting aside why she was suddenly making him this offer, Seol Jihu felt like he knew what her intentions were. The past Seol Jihu would have been attracted to this offer for sure. If he was the same gambling addict he was back then, he would have accepted immediately with joy.", "But that wasn\u2019t the case now.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d", "There were two reasons he flat out rejected her offer. The first was that he had mostly ended his relationship with Yoo Seonhwa, and the second was obviously Paradise.", "He refused to give this up, even if he was held at gunpoint.", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s long, slender eyebrows faintly bent out of shape.", "\u201cI told you, it won\u2019t be difficult at all. You\u2019ll make more than you do now, and you\u2019ll have more time too.

Even if you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a matter of personal preference. I think the work I do right now is perfect for me. Plus\u2014 I still have a lot of things I have to do.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke firmly without missing a single beat.", "\u201cI won\u2019t quit.\u201d", "The moment he put the nail in the coffin, Yoo Seonhwa stared at him with a burning gaze.", "\u201c\u2026But it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d", "A short mutter escaped her mouth. When a straightforward gaze glared at him, Seol Jihu suddenly came to his senses. Moreover, he had heard the muffled mutter, and a hint of surprise crossed his face.", "His heart stung a bit.", "\u201cD-Dangerous?\u201d", "He averted his gaze unknowingly.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a pharmaceutical company.\u201d", "That wasn\u2019t enough of a reason to deem a job dangerous.", "\u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding something. I\u2019m not doing clinical trials there or even researching new medicine. I\u2019m just a sales rep. There\u2019s nothing dangerous.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "Seol Jihu explained skillfully, but Yoo Seonhwa kept digging into the matter.", "\u201cCan you say it\u2019s not even a tiny bit dangerous?\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows. The way she was talking, it was as if she was telling him to quit because the job was dangerous. It was then that the slight doubt in his mind bloomed into a real one.", "\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m lying?\u201d", "Feeling like she was impeding his ability to enter Paradise, Seol Jihu\u2019s voice turned sharp. But after saying it out loud, he went \u201cAh.\u201d", "At the same time, Yoo Seonhwa looked as if she was at a loss for words. She bit her lower lip and looked straight at the young man.", "A sudden silence descended.", "\u201cBecause you\u2026\u201d", "In the suffocating silence, Yoo Seonhwa quietly spoke.", "\u201cBecause you don\u2019t look at my eyes when you lie.\u201d", "After a brief silence, a long sigh flowed out. Yoo Seonhwa put the shopping bag down.", "\u201cTake some time to think about it.\u201d", "And although she stared at Seol Jihu for a little while longer\u2026", "\u201cI\u2019ll be off then.\u201d", "She soon turned around and left.", "The front door closed quietly. Like a bolt out of the blue, left alone once again, Seol Jihu stood frozen like a rock for a long time. Only when the sound of her footsteps completely vanished did he finally come back to his senses.", "\u201c\u2026The heck\u2026\u201d", "Smoothing down his face with his hands, he suddenly caught sight of the shopping bag Yoo Seonhwa left behind. Inside it were bento boxes with rice and side dishes.", "Opening them one by one, he saw braised short ribs, soy sauce braised quail eggs, kimchi pancake, bulgogi, and vegetables for bibimbap. They were all Seol Jihu\u2019s favorites.", "\u201c\u2026Gulp.\u201d", "His mind was in a complicated place, but his mouth was honest. It quickly ordered him to put the food inside it.", "In the end, Seol Jihu started an unexpected, early sumptuous lunch.", "\u2018But what was that?\u2019", "Yoo Seonhwa coming to visit him without telling him wasn\u2019t such an uncommon thing. Looking back, that\u2019s what she always did.", "No matter how difficult he made things for her or how hard he pushed her away, she would always come see him first and comfort him to do better. Although the time between her visits got longer as he betrayed her trust more and more, the result was always the same.", "The past Seol Jihu knew this better than anyone else and used it to his advantage, clinging onto Yoo Seonhwa.", "The problem was what came afterward.", "One time, Seol Jihu claimed to have quit gambling and reformed, begging Yoo Seonhwa to live together in a two-room apartment. And the moment he received the security deposit from her, he ran to the casino.", "After this incident, Yoo Seonhwa became hesitant when it came to giving him money. Making him the co-owner of her new shop?", "\u2018It\u2019s too strange.\u2019", "He tilted his head constantly. But in any case, the food was great. As he was familiar with her cooking skills, Seol Jihu nodded his head. The braised short ribs were soft and chewy, almost like the ones Seo Yuhui made on Huge Stone Rocky Mountain\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "When he thought how similar the two meals were, Seol Jihu suddenly stopped in the middle of taking another spoonful of rice.", "\u2018Could it be?\u2019", "Thinking about it now, it felt like Yoo Seonhwa was trying to pull him out of going back to Paradise no matter what. Of course, this only made sense if Yoo Seonhwa was an Earthling who knew about Paradise\u2019s existence\u2026", "But could he confidently say she wasn\u2019t?", "[\u2026But it\u2019s dangerous.]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes rolled in a circle. He had often gotten the feeling that Seo Yuhui was oddly similar to Yoo Seonhwa.", "Although there were clear differences that distinguished them, Seol Jihu wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Paradise had a polymorph magic of some sort.", "With how strange today\u2019s visit was and the odd feeling he got from it, he really couldn\u2019t be blamed for suspecting this possibility.", "He could be right, or he could be wrong.", "\u2018Let me think.\u2019", "He had to think of all possibilities, but the simplest way was to confirm with his own eyes.", "In that instant, Seol Jihu shot up from the kitchen chair as though he had been hit by lightning. Dashing to the window and looking out, he could see Yoo Seonhwa leaving the building.", "Soon, she turned a corner and disappeared into an alleyway.", "Seol Jihu quickly threw on his clothes and shoes. He didn\u2019t forget to stuff the remaining food into his stomach, then picked up the items he planned to bring and tore the return ticket in half.", "Finally, he was back in Paradise.", "Normally, he would have walked out of the temple leisurely, feeling himself in the moment, but he didn\u2019t have the time now.", "Running out with a shopping bag in each hand, Seol Jihu stopped by the reception desk and asked if he could check the entry and exit records.", "But the reply he got was, \u201cWe can\u2019t reveal anyone\u2019s personal information, even if the person asking is you. And especially if the information you\u2019re asking about is Lady Seo Yuhui\u2019s.\u201d", "The receptionist seemed adamant. Because it looked like she wouldn\u2019t give in even if he laid down with his belly exposed, Seol Jihu turned around without lingering attachments.", "Activating the Festina Earring, he quickly ran to the Carpe Diem office. But instead of going inside, he changed course and headed to the building on the opposite side of the street.", "\u2018If she\u2019s here, it\u2019s significantly less likely that they\u2019re the same person.\u2019", "\u2018If she\u2019s not here\u2026 then the question is up in the air.\u2019", "Seol Jihu dearly wished for Seo Yuhui to be inside, and raised his hands as soon as he got to the door.", "Dum, dum, dum, dum! Knocking on the door loudly, he shouted.", "\u201cYuhui Noona!\u201d"]}
