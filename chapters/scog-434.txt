Tears were flowing down her face.", "Just because of a dream?", "Today\u2019s dream, like most dreams, became hazy once she woke up. However, there were also parts that were firmly etched into her brain.", "The face of a man she had never seen before, his words, and his actions were all pulling at her heartstrings. Whenever she recalled him, the feeling of regret and affection welled up, making her tear up.", "After calming down, Seo Yuhui carefully organized her thoughts.", "Just what happened? Did she have a dream? Or did she really go back in time?", "Seo Yuhui pondered for a long time before concluding that this was not something to decide rashly.", "She was currently an Executor who retired from Paradise due to Luxuria\u2019s influence being too overbearing. Going back just because of an inexplicable dream would be too hasty. That said, the emotions overflowing inside her were too intense to be the outcome of a mere dream.", "Seo Yuhui got up and sat down in front of her desk.

She found it ridiculous, no matter how she thought about it.", "But no matter how small the chance was, if she actually returned to the past or had a premonition in the form of a dream, she believed the note would come in handy one day.", "*", "One month passed since then. During this time, Seo Yuhui thought about calling Yoo Seonhwa multiple times but ultimately held back.", "She needed more time to collect her thoughts and think about things rationally. She especially wanted to avoid causing an unwanted butterfly effect by making a rash move. If she did, there was a chance that even the small portion of the future she remembered would go astray.", "Furthermore, there was no guarantee that the future would pan out according to the content of the dream. And so, she planned to act with utmost caution.", "That was until she received a sudden phone call in the middle of April 2017.", "\u201cI-Is this Miss Seonhwa?\u201d", "\u2014Yes, it\u2019s me.", "\u201cMiss Seonhwa? Is it really you?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa had called her.", "Seo Yuhui had retired from Paradise after sealing the stele in the aftermath of the Imperial Oath Expedition, and Yoo Seonhwa had never called her about it.", "Of course, this wasn\u2019t anything strange. In 2014, Yoo Seonhwa went off the radar in Paradise at the height of her activity after returning to Korea from studying abroad. It wasn\u2019t until ten months later in Earth\u2019s time that she reappeared in Paradise.", "Seo Yuhui had not heard from her during that time either.", "Moreover, Yoo Seonhwa was an Earthling who worked alone, and the reason they exchanged phone numbers in the first place was to come together only when it was an absolute necessity.", "And so, other than times when she was acting as part of a team, Seo Yuhui did not know about Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s whereabouts.", "\u2014Yes, I have something to say.", "A calm voice rang out. What followed afterward was not something Seo Yuhui could overlook.", "\u2014Did you hear? That son of a bitch went missing.", "Seo Yuhui doubted her ears.", "\u2014He disappeared from both places.

She would not be so worried if it were anyone else, but Sung Shihyun was a ticking time bomb that was as unpredictable as a loose cannon.", "There was simply no way she could not be worried.", "\u2014Don\u2019t worry about it for now. I will look into it myself.", "Seo Yuhui blinked in confusion as she thought Yoo Seonhwa was calling to ask her to investigate.", "\u2014Instead, can you do me a favor?\u201d", "\u201cA favor?\u201d", "\u2014Yes. I\u2019d like you to look into a newbie from March of 2017.", "\u201cYou want information on this person?\u201d", "\u2014Rather than information\u2026 if this person is confirmed to have entered that place, I\u2019d like you to protect him even if it\u2019s just for a short time.", "Yoo Seonhwa sounded hesitant.", "\u2014And if possible, can you create an opportunity for me to approach him?", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u2014Please. He\u2019s like family to me. If something goes wrong\u2026.", "But she quickly understood after thinking about Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s circumstance. Like with most famous people, Yoo Seonhwa had many enemies. And due to the incident where she killed every participating member except one, in Stage 3 of the Banquet, many organizations had a grudge against her.", "If Baek Haeju, who was known to work alone, suddenly showed interest in a newbie and approached him, many people would be suspicious of their relationship and investigate the newbie.", "That could easily lead them to find out about Yoo Seonhwa entering Paradise. And if they managed to catch wind of Baek Haeju\u2019s past being fabricated\u2026 then not just Yoo Seonhwa but also her family would be put in danger.", "On the other hand, Seo Yuhui would have a comparatively easier time approaching the newbie. After all, it wasn\u2019t just once or twice that she helped a talented Earthling grow.", "\u2014Can you do this for me?", "\u201cSure\u2026. It doesn\u2019t sound all that difficult.\u201d", "\u2014Thank you. I\u2019ll make sure to return the favor.", "Right, it wasn\u2019t as if Seo Yuhui didn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s just\u2026", "\u201cSo, what\u2019s this person\u2019s name?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui suppressed her rising curiosity and asked.", "\u2014Seol Jihu.", "And as soon as she heard Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s reply, she jumped out of her seat in shock.

We can talk about the details when we meet up\u2026.", "Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s voice was grave.", "Seo Yuhui quickly scanned her notes and organized her thoughts.", "Yoo Seonhwa, who did everything by herself and was more protective of her personal information than anyone else, was taking a huge risk for someone else.", "This could only mean that this man was related to Yoo Seonhwa on a very personal level.", "Seo Yuhui had been doubtful, but with this, she confirmed that the contents of the notes were true.", "\u2018It wasn\u2019t a dream.\u2019", "But even with evidence, she couldn\u2019t help harbor doubts.", "Seo Yuhui asked again to be sure.", "\"\u2026The things you said, are they coming from your heart?\"", "*", "\u2018Future Vision.\u2019", "After returning to Paradise, Seo Yuhui fell into deep thought upon seeing her status window.

There's no need for you to kill the cigarette. If you walk a little away from here, you can find a pla\u2026.!?\u201d", "It was then. Seo Yuhui\u2019s eyes widened as she pointed toward the plaza.", "\u2018Ah!!\u2019", "Although she had never seen the man\u2019s face before, it didn\u2019t feel new. The man gave off a younger and a completely different atmosphere, but his facial features were most certainly the same.", "\u201cOh my.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui covered her mouth unknowingly.", "How could she forget when this face was what she remembered most clearly from her dream?", "\u2018W-Why is he here?\u2019", "She was taken aback as she never expected to reunite with him here. Her heart was pounding despite acting calm on the outside.", "She most definitely had never met him before, but a deep sense of yearning and delight welled up in her heart.", "That was when Kim Hannah appeared, and Seo Yuhui invited the two inside.", "She needed information. She wanted to know exactly how the future had changed.", "Thankfully, Kim Hannah asked him what he had been up to.", "Seo Yuhui eavesdropped on their conversation while brewing tea on the side.", "However, she almost couldn\u2019t believe her ears.", "\u2018What?\u2019", "As a Level 1, not only did he enter the Forest of Denial, but he also participated in a war against the Parasites?", "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he had apparently volunteered as bait.", "\u201cAha, hahaha. Those chasing Cockroaches were pretty scary.\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu grinning stupidly without knowing how she felt, anger shot up in her heart.

She found it hard to believe that this was her natural emotion, so she assumed it was Luxuria\u2019s will.", "Despite not knowing how the two were related, this matter also confirmed one of her suspicions.", "Seo Yuhui then took this opportunity to ask him a question.", "\u201cDid you do something to Sinyoung?\u201d", "\u201cNo, not at all.
