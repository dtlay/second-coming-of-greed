It was as if an invisible wave penetrated through him.", "Just as Seol Jihu and Yun Seohui shut their mouths from the odd sensation\u2026", "Woong!", "A short but imposing noise resounded over the area.", "Next, white light began to glimmer in their line of sight. The streetlights illuminating the city flickered crazily as if they had gone mad.", "Moreover, terrifying energy could be felt rising up, one that seemed to be on the verge of bursting out of Scheherazade\u2019s deepest area.", "Feeling a frightening pressure, Seol Jihu and Yun Seohui subconsciously moved backward.", "In the next moment\u2026", "Flash!", "The world in their eyes was dyed white.", "At the same time, Seol Jihu faintly saw a pillar of light soaring up to the sky from the center of Scheherazade, spinning in a spiral and rippling out far and wide.", "By this time, the area had turned into a strange space where no sound could be heard.", "Meanwhile, the light expanded its domain fast and wide, breaking through the city wall and rushing outside.", "In fact, it only took a second for it to cover the area where Seol Jihu was standing.", "\u201cKeuk!\u201d", "The light touched his body. He didn\u2019t feel any killing intent or harmful energy. He was only pushed back.", "The light pushed Yun Seohui and Seol Jihu out as if it would not let anyone into its sacred land. A few corpses that made their way out of the city were pushed further out.", "The light didn\u2019t stop spreading until Seol Jihu was pushed 50 meters out.", "When Seol Jihu narrowly grabbed hold of himself, he instinctively raised his eyes. His breath paused.", "A massive, seemingly endless barrier exuding a powerful holy power that made one\u2019s skin tremble surrounded Scheherazade in a grand manner.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s expression contorted as he looked at the city.", "[There are two powers lying dormant inside Scheherazade\u2026. No, it would be more correct to say there is one power split into two stages.]", "[The first stage activates a mechanism that turns the entire city into a special territory, and the second stage releases the power of god stored in Gorad Boga to form a powerful barrier that envelopes the city.]", "\u2026Right, the second level of Gorad Boga had activated.", "\u2018How?\u2019", "The first stage might be activatable, but it shouldn\u2019t be so easy to release the power of a god.", "Did Roe Scheherazade use the Royal Oath? Otherwise, how could she have activated the second stage?", "\u2018\u2026Damn it.\u2019", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows. Looking back, there were quite a few existences inside Scheherazade that were bestowed with divinity. If the first stage served as a preparatory step, activating the second stage might not have been so difficult.", "Despite having doubts, Seol Jihu dropped that line of thought and raised his spear.", "He cut and slashed madly, but the barrier did not budge. Never mind a crack, not even a tiny ripple billowed out.", "It bounced off all of Seol Jihu\u2019s attacks as though they were comical.", "Seol Jihu gritted his teeth and retracted his spear. He could tell the situation was getting out of hand, but there was nothing he could do.", "\u2018Should I have stood my ground\u2026?\u2019", "He regretted belatedly but shook his head shortly afterward.", "Even if he stayed inside, he would have been pushed out by the barrier anyhow. He might have been slammed into the city wall or pushed out through the city gate if he was lucky.", "How much time went by?", "Baek Haeju, Kazuki, Phi Sora, and Hoshino Urara rushed to Scheherazade at a frightening speed.", "They had jumped out of the carriage and raced to the city with the aid of mana because they were worried about Seol Jihu.", "They were confused when they saw Seol Jihu standing in a daze but stopped after seeing the giant barrier.", "Phi Sora, who was running in the sky with Pneuma\u2019s Sky Boots, almost fell down in shock when she saw Scheherazade.", "Once some time went by, the remaining Valhalla members arrived.", "Their reaction was no different. Once they arrived at the city, they stared at the vast barrier with dumbfounded faces.", "\u201cW-What the hell happened?\u201d", "\u201cSeol! What\u2019s up with the city? What happened here?\u201d", "Chohong and Hugo asked in a fluster.", "\u201cGorad Boga\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui looked back and forth between the huge barrier and the dazedly standing Seol Jihu before closing her eyes and biting her lower lip.", "It was then.", "A group appeared above the city wall.", "Including the brutally beaten Vulgar Chastity, Twisted Kindness, Exploding Patience, and Abhorrent Charity were there too. To top it off\u2026", "\u201cYooooo~! Beautiful morning! If you\u2019re asking how my day\u2019s going, that is~\u201d", "Sung Shihyun was there too, acting just as cocky as always.", "Seol Jihu gulped unnoticeably as he looked up at the city wall.", "There were five Army Commanders.", "Since only six Army Commanders remained in Paradise, it sufficed to say that almost all of the Parasites\u2019 elite forces were invading the human territory.", "But it was still too early to be surprised.", "Soon, Seol Jihu saw a woman skipping up to the city wall, butt-naked. She looked down and smiled brightly.", "It was Roe Scheherazade.", "What Seol Jihu had been worried about the most came true.", "\u201cHello. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade spread her arms out and gently waved her hand.", "When Seol Jihu glared at her with his mouth tightly shut, she tilted her head and raised the corner of her mouth.", "\u201cI thought you\u2019d be surprised\u2026.

How lucky~\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade covered her mouth and laughed gracefully.", "\u201c\u2026Roe Scheherazade.\u201d", "Kazuki, who was watching with hawk-eyes, calmly asked.", "\u201cIs this your doing?\u201d", "A loaded question came out.", "However, Roe Scheherazade\u2026", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u2026answered without the slightest hesitation.", "Almost as if she was proud.", "By now, most of Valhalla\u2019s members realized what was going on. That Roe Scheherazade had helped the Parasites invade and conquer the city.", "In other words, she was a traitor.", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cWhy? Well\u2026\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade pushed her lower lip up with her finger and rolled her eyes.", "\u201cI guess you can say it\u2019s to avenge my husband.\u201d", "\u201cAvenge your husband?\u201d", "\u201cYes, my husband was killed by the Earthlings, you see.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade spoke with clarity before looking down at Yun Seohui, who was sitting on the ground.", "Yun Seohui shook her head with a sour look.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to pretend to be oblivious. Well, you weren\u2019t the executive director back then, so I\u2019m sure you weren\u2019t the one responsible for giving the order. Still\u2026 you knew about it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d", "Everyone\u2019s gaze fell on Yun Seohui.", "\u201cI, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d", "Yun Seohui stuttered.", "\u201cI was only told one day that Gairos Scheherazade was poisoned to death\u2026. In the first place, there\u2019s no proof Sinyoung was behind it!\u201d", "\u201cFufu, still acting so shameless. Do you want to know how I found out?\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade smiled gently.

Seol Jihu doubted his ears.", "\u201cIt came as a total surprise. Shocked after hearing of my husband\u2019s death, I went to the temple, thinking that the divine protection was somehow related. And this is what the Seven Sins told me.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade cleared her throat.", "\u201cMy husband, Gairos, used the Royal Oath to protect my life, to not let my Royal Oath get stolen, and to not have me suffer the same fate he did\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu finally understood why his Innate Ability didn\u2019t work on Roe Scheherazade.

He was pulling my hair and whispering into my ear, *Damn Gairos, you should have just handed it over! Now that it\u2019s come to this, I\u2019ll make your wife hand it over herself!\u201d", "Realizing how heated she had gotten, Roe Scheherazade collected her breath and then continued calmly.", "\u201cAs proof, you all have stopped demanding the Royal Oath after Gairos died. Though you were acting like you were sorry, it was because a restriction was placed on you, no?\u201d", "Yun Seohui\u2019s face paled.", "A heavy silence descended.", "The entire city was dead silent, enough to let one hear others\u2019 breaths.", "\u201cThat\u2019s when I swore to get revenge.
