Now that she took another look, the killer\u2019s wrist was held in place midair. The reason it took her so long to realize this was because Seol Jihu was still looking at her. He had stopped the attack without even looking at it.", "\u201cYou\u2019re sure, right?\u201d", "He asked again as if nothing happened. Staring dazedly, Eun Yuri nodded. Seol Jihu turned back.", "\u201cHaha, little brat.\u201d", "The arm in Seol Jihu\u2019s hand trembled. It was only a few centimeters away from its intended target, but there was a terrifying pressure completely holding it in lockdown. The killer couldn\u2019t help but feel that its hand was stuck inside a boulder.", "\u201cKiiiii!\u201d", "As he struggled desperately, the axe began to go down by microscopic lengths.", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "But when the intrigued Seol Jihu tightened his grip, even that came to a complete stop.", "Seol Jihu never used his mana. His Strength stat was Intermediate (Intermediate). Even though this was a special Tutorial, his strength wasn\u2019t something that could be withstood by a monster that wouldn\u2019t last a day in the ancient emperor\u2019s villa.", "Crack! In the end, the killer spat out a groan with a loud crack.", "\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if you didn\u2019t follow us.\u201d", "Seol Jihu twisted the killer\u2019s wrist without dragging things out.", "Craaaack!", "\u201cKUAAA!\u201d", "The killer shrieked. He must have a sense of pain as he was writhing in agony. Although he still managed to seize the axe in his left hand and swing it\u2014", "\u201cNice try.\u201d", "He let go of the axe when a powerful punch twisted into his stomach. When Seol Jihu dealt another blow in the same spot without a break, the killer fell on his knees with a thud. Once a swift kick swept past his lower jaw, he collapsed completely.", "\u2018So he was green because he was weak\u2026\u2019", "He must have posed no threat unless Seol Jihu knowingly pulled his neck out and said, \u2018Please kill me.\u2019 As Seol Jihu was hoping for a thrilling life-or-death battle, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head in disappointment.", "At the end of the day, this was the Tutorial. There were thousands of things to do in the Neutral Zone. It was better to take the easy route and get there as quickly as possible.", "\u201cKrrrrr\u2026.\u201d", "The axe killer bared his teeth and glared at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cDon\u2019t show your teeth.\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu\u2019s foot slammed down on the glaring killer\u2019s teeth and shattered them completely.", "Bzz, bzz! The phone vibrated again. Seol Jihu had no clue what was updated but was observing the killer\u2019s waist closely. Just like Eun Yuri said, several weapons were hanging there. Unfortunately, he did not see a spear.", "\u201cNo spear? Why don\u2019t you carry one around?\u201d", "\u201cWuuu\u2026. Wuu\u2026.\u201d", "A sorrowful cry flowed out, but Seol Jihu clenched his fist grumpily.", "\u201cShut up, bastard.\u201d", "Thwack! Once he delivered a powerful hook to the killer\u2019s bloody mouth, the killer quickly became silent. Seol Jihu picked up a machete before giving it a few swings and turning back to Eun Yuri.", "\u201cDo you want to deal the finishing blow? That should be enough to get you some points.\u201d", "Eun Yuri shook her head vehemently.", "\u201cOh, then I guess I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d", "\u201cNo! That\u2019s not it.\u201d", "As Seol Jihu stepped on the killer and raised his machete, Eun Yuri ran up to him in a hurry and held his arm.", "\u201cLook at this.\u201d", "Eun Yuri showed her phone to the confused Seol Jihu.", "[Sender: Unknown]#Forest (Diary of an Unknown Survivor \u2014 Page 22)", "\u2018We\u2019re already on page 22\u2026?\u2019", "Seol Jihu was somewhat surprised at their progress as he calmly read the content.", "", "We finally got rid of the killer! Although two of us got hurt, we all shook in excitement knowing the killer who made us tremble in fear was dead.", "Someone suggested holding the killer captive while discussing what to do with him, but how could we? Everyone happily joined in on hacking the killer to death.", "As the killer screamed its last breath, black smoke shot out of his body and disappeared into the far distance. Was an evil spirit possessing the killer\u2019s body?", "The important thing was that this damned killer was finally dead. We all laughed and celebrated victory for the first time in a while. We should be able to get some sweet sleep tonight.", "\u2026Less than an hour later, something absurd happened.", "Damn it! She was right! The Sixth Mother is angry! We shouldn\u2019t have taken the killer\u2019s life with our hands!", "", "After reading the diary, Seol Jihu understood why Eun Yuri stopped him. It was spelled out for him. That a survivor should not kill the killer with their own hands.", "\u2018The Sixth Mother is angry?\u2019", "He didn\u2019t know the meaning of this sentence, but now it didn\u2019t feel right to kill him so easily. Perhaps killing the killers was one of the conditions for increasing the Tutorial\u2019s difficulty.", "\u2018So I shouldn\u2019t underestimate this Tutorial?\u2019", "Well, let\u2019s see how amazing the rewards are then. Seol Jihu grumbled inwardly while lowering the machete.", "He didn\u2019t want to kill the killer, but he didn\u2019t want to release him either. Just as he was wondering what to do\u2026", "\u201cUm\u2026\u201d", "Eun Yuri carefully held up the rope. Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes lit up.", "\u201cAh, that rope is supposed to neutralize the killer, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "He wondered what use it would have when he first saw it, but now he understood.", "Eun Yuri tied up the killer on her own even though Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say anything. He expected her to simply spin the rope around the killer, but she surprisingly made a tortoise-shell bind. Her hands moved very naturally.", "Bzz, bzz!", "", "[Sender: Unknown]#Forest (Diary of an Unknown Survivor \u2014 Page 24)", "We captured another killer. The losses this time were greater due to the killers\u2019 increased strength. This time, to not repeat the same mistake, we tied up the killer with a rope.", "But what should we do? How can we eliminate the killer without the Sixth Mother finding out?We need to look for a way\u2026 but the killer\u2019s howls are too noisy. We need to hurry up and do something about it\u2026", "The Diary of the Unknown Survivor updated again. Seol Jihu focused on the phrase, \u2018without the Sixth Mother finding out.\u2019", "Suddenly, more information was revealed. Seol Jihu spoke, thinking that they needed some time to reorganize themselves before taking further action.", "\u201cLet\u2019s get a move on first. Ah, give that here.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took over the rope, opened the map, then started walking while dragging the bound killer on the ground.", "*", "Fifteen spots were marked on the map. Except for the three marks that had special shapes, the rest were all shaped like a house.", "Walking to the nearest house mark, just as expected\u2014 Seol Jihu saw a cabin with its lights turned off.", "Due to the entire island being covered in a forest, the cabin looked more like a cabin from a horror movie than a vacation cabin.", "", "[Sender: Unknown]#Cabin (Diary of the Unknown Survivor \u2014 Page 2)", "We chanced upon a cabin while frantically running away. Only after walking inside and locking the front and back door did we breathe a sigh of relief.", "Finding shelter is nice and all, but what are we supposed to do from now?No, snap out of it. There must be a way out! Let\u2019s search around the cabin first. There might be something useful.", "We should leave the lights turned off, right? This cabin isn\u2019t necessarily safe, so we should be careful not to attract unwanted attention\u2026", "Seol Jihu threw the axe killer somewhere nearby and entered the cabin. Just like the diary said, he locked the front and back door. Only, he turned the lights on.", "The cabin had two floors and was about 130 square meters in size. Seol Jihu and Eun Yuri searched the cabin thoroughly, but contrary to their expectations, there was nothing other than a little bit of canned food and two bottles of water.", "Although they also found a map, it was unnecessary since they had the Diary of the Unknown Survivor.", "Once the search ended, Seol Jihu looked for Eun Yuri. She was fiddling around with the paper talisman.", "\u201cThe paper talismans are like the Necessary Boxes. The spell you need the most in your current situation will activate.\u201d", "Eun Yuri flinched. She put the talismans away like a child who was caught doing something wrong.", "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to use any.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I was hoping for one, but we got three. Just save one and you can use the other ones whenever you want.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said with a smile.", "\u201cOh, by the way, are you hungry? Do you want anything to eat?\u201d", "Eun Yuri shook her head.", "\u201cOr you can sleep for an hour or two. You must be tired.\u201d", "Shake, shake.", "Seol Jihu shrugged.", "\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s talk.\u201d", "He sat down in the dusty living room. Once Eun Yuri sat down as well, he took out his cellphone.", "\u201cLet me explain what we\u2019re going to do from now on.\u201d", "He pointed to each of the three special marks on the map.", "\u201cBridge, car, and ship\u2026 that\u2019s what they look like right? Well, it could be a boat. Anyway, these three are probably ways to get out of this island.\u201d", "\u201cRight.\u201d", "\u201cTaking a bridge at the end of the island, hopping on a car to throw off the pursuing killers and taking an escape through the center of the island in a roundabout way, or getting on a ship and sailing away. They all make sense. But, they probably won\u2019t be easy.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThere must be traps or schemes that would hinder us. No matter which, the Tutorial probably won\u2019t let us escape so easily.\u201d", "Remembering the trap on the stairway to the second floor and the steel bars that blocked the way to the gathering point, Eun Yuri nodded right away.", "\u201cTo be honest, escaping this island isn\u2019t all that difficult.\u201d", "Seol Jihu crossed his arm.", "\u201cIf we set our mind to it, we can even leave this instant.\u201d", "But both Seol Jihu and Eun Yuri knew that should not be done.", "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure whether one exists on this island, we have to find a hidden space. There\u2019s a good chance that the special reward will be in this hidden stage.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201cBut I can\u2019t figure out just where it could be. There\u2019s nothing on the map that looks out of place\u2026 how troubling.\u201d", "Seol Jihu sighed as he tapped the screen.", "\u201cIf only we had a clue\u2026\u201d", "Eun Yuri murmured to herself.

The way I interpret it, there are five killers\u2014 the first to fifth\u2014 and the Sixth Mother must be the one controlling them.\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026 What are the chances there is a mother for each of the killers? In that case, there might be at least six killers.\u201d", "\u201cI considered that when I first read page 22, but the next page that opened up showed that this wasn\u2019t true.\u201d", "Eun Yuri turned to page 24.", "[We captured another killer.][How can we get rid of the killer without the Sixth Mother finding out?]", "\u201cAs you can see, they captured a killer after the first one they killed. Two killers were gotten rid of, but the Sixth Mother was mentioned in both.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was astonished.", "\u201cAh, so that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI think this Sixth Mother is related to the hidden space.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyebrow went up.", "\u201cThe contents of page 22 and page 24 can be connected. If a survivor kills a killer, the Sixth Mother will find out and become angry.\u201d", "\u201cRight.\u201d", "Seol Jihu then thought, \u2018if they wanted to eliminate the killers, they needed to find a way to avoid the Sixth Mother\u2019s detection. Otherwise, the Sixth Mother\u2019s rage would cause the remaining killers to get stronger.\u2019", "However, what Eun Yuri said next revealed that her thoughts were different.", "\u201cWhen you captured the axe killer before, was there anyone near you?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d", "\u201cIf the Sixth Mother wasn\u2019t there, how would she know that the killer was killed?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 I suppose they can communicate somehow.

Next, she slowly explained her plan.", "Soon, when the explanation came to an end, Seol Jihu\u2019s brows narrowed.
