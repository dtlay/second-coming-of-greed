It was hard to tell whether the bikini was a swimsuit or lingerie.", "\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?

A character sits at his desk fanning himself with his hand, complaining, \u2018Hot~ It\u2019s so hot~\u2019 And then another one comes in wearing a swimsuit and a tube around his waist, yelling, \u2018Let\u2019s go to the beach!\u2019 The opening song plays and the scene changes to a beach.

If he could go beyond that horizon, he would certainly reach paradise\u2026.", "Thinking so, Seol Jihu was about to speed up his jet ski when suddenly\u2026.", "Chwaa!", "A big wave splashed on him.", "The cold temperature of the water brought Seol Jihu to his senses.", "\u201cWhat the?\u201d", "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly be here for a casual boat ride!\u201d", "Chohong smirked, and the jet ski carrying Chohong and Maria quickly moved away.", "Chwaa!", "Just then another splash of water struck him.", "Hoshino Urara had braked, splashing water into the air seconds before her jet ski collided with Seol Jihu\u2019s.", "\u201cUgh.
