{"cid": "94", "title": "Chapter 94. Miscalculation", "content": ["The coffee shop\u2019s door opened, and a young man walked in. After looking around the place carefully, he spotted a young woman sitting by the window. She was in a semiformal attire rather than her usual grey business suit, but her neatly tied ponytail was a definite trademark of Kim Hannah.", "The young man walked up to her stiffly, but Kim Hannah showed zero reactions. She had her arms folded and her legs crossed, staring in front of her with an expressionless face.", "Like a criminal with clear evidence against him, Seol Jihu hesitantly sat down on the seat across from her.", "\u201cKim Hannah\u2026.\u201d", "He called her quietly, but Kim Hannah wasn\u2019t even staring at him. He couldn\u2019t be sure whether she was zoned out or just ignoring him, but her eyes were staring at the empty air.", "A heavy silence filled the atmosphere. Seol Jihu looked down somewhat in shame. The awkward atmosphere was hard to bear. He would have much preferred Kim Hannah to spit out curses as he expected her to, but she had a different air about her.", "\u2018This can\u2019t be good.\u2019", "He schemed to look for the right opportunity to gloss over the subject, but that thought vanished completely. No matter how mischievous and immature he was, he knew when and when not to joke with someone.", "Just as he was starting to get worried that his pounding heart might pop out of his chest\u2026", "\u201cI\u2019ve thought a lot about it.\u201d", "Kim Hannah finally began.", "\u201cYou might have thought\u2026 that I was being overprotective of you. Of course, I don\u2019t agree with that at all, but I understand if that\u2019s what you thought.\u201d", "She continued in a quiet voice.", "\u201cI thought doing so was best for you, but I guess what\u2019s important in the end is how you perceived it. And putting it that way, giving you the communication crystal was careless of me. Using my status as your protector to interfere in your life or to get you to do what I want, you might have thought about me that way.\u201d", "Kim Hannah sounded serious. Seol Jihu was just about to say, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never about you that way,\u201d but when he saw Kim Hannah taking out a white envelope from her purse, he flinched.", "\u201cSo.\u201d", "She put the envelope on the table and placed her hand on top of it. Her hand trembled as if she was about to push it forward.", "\u201cIf you really want\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied as his instincts told him to.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Kim Hannah sounded like a well-sharpened blade.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think of you that way. Not now.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head. When he activated Nine Eyes, the envelope changed color. Kim Hannah was gold just like before, but the envelope had a murky yellow color.", "This was the first time Seol Jihu was seeing the Golden Commandment with the Attention Required.", "\u201cI\u2019m being honest.\u201d", "Seol Jihu quickly added. He didn\u2019t know what was inside the envelope, but he had a strong feeling he must never receive it. The moment he did, he felt like Kim Hannah would disappear from his life.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t think of me that way, yet\u2026.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s eyebrows perked up. For the first time since Seol Jihu entered the coffee shop, she met his eyes.", "\u201cYou acted that way?\u201d", "When he saw her icy gaze, he shrunk back like a frog in front of a snake. One thing he could be glad about was that her hand holding the yellow envelope went loose. However, she still had her hand on it.", "Tap, tap, tap- Kim Hannah rapidly tapped on the envelope with her index finger before opening her mouth.", "\u201cHow was it?\u201d", "\u201cHm?\u201d", "\u201cThose eight days. It couldn\u2019t have been just once or twice that your life was at risk\u2026. It was fun, right? Hovering over the boundary of life and death, weren\u2019t those moments electrifying? Ah, you even had a beautiful princess by your side, so it must have been exhilarating.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly.", "\u201cAm I wrong? If it looked like it wouldn\u2019t work out, it would have been as simple as committing suicide before getting caught.\u201d", "\u201cKim Hannah, I know you\u2019re angry and I can understand why. Since I didn\u2019t keep the promise I made, it\u2019s my fault 100 percent. But\u2026 I\u2019m not the type to enjoy trouble. No, it\u2019s not even right to call that incident \u2018trouble\u2019. I\u2019m not a psychopath who enjoys death.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s serious tone put a frown on Kim Hannah\u2019s face.", "\u201cThat experience\u2026 was a nightmare. It was like I was standing before a huge wall with nowhere to go. I was starving, my throat was parched, my body screamed in pain, and I couldn\u2019t even sleep properly because of the constant pursuit from the enemies\u2026. What happened was my fault, but it wasn\u2019t just once or twice that I wanted to kill myself in despair. Right, those eight days were a nightmare, one that I never want to experience again.\u201d", "Tap, tap- Kim Hannah\u2019s index finger became slower. She furrowed her brows.", "\u201cSo you weren\u2019t enjoying yourself? Think about it carefully. Of course, it might have been hard for you at the time, but now that everything\u2019s gone and passed, don\u2019t you think about it this way?\u201d", "\u201cWhat way?\u201d", "\u201cYou know, content, satisfying, even something along the lines of, \u2018I knew I could do it\u2019 or \u2018It was a good experience\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d", "Seol Jihu chuckled as if he waved his hand around.", "\u201cI don\u2019t even think that way about my time in the military. Plus, I already told you how I felt. I won\u2019t think about it that way even in ten years.\u201d", "\u201cReally? You really don\u2019t think this way?\u201d", "\u201cYou probably don\u2019t understand. Returning alive, eating, drinking, sleeping on a bed, and even talking with you here, everything feels like a dream to me. I\u2019m happy, but sometimes, I\u2019m worried I would close my eyes and open them, only to find myself in that situation again.\u201d", "Tap, tap- Kim Hannah\u2019s tapping sped down noticeably. She studied Seol Jihu as if she was trying to sniff out a secret. Her expression was clearly one of confusion. Her eyes narrowed, and as if to give up, she bit down on her lips.", "\u201cThen what is it?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cIf it\u2019s not that, then why did you go? Money? No, if you cared about money so much, you wouldn\u2019t have rejected me previously. Is it honor, then? No, the Seol Jihu I know isn\u2019t someone who\u2019s obsessed about honor.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cSo if it\u2019s not money or honor, what is it? I just can\u2019t understand. Whatever, fine, if you\u2019re telling me the truth, prove it to me, right now.\u201d", "Thunk. Kim Hannah kicked the table and asked in a forceful tone.", "\u201cIf something similar happens in the future, what will you do? Since you know it\u2019s tough enough to make you want to kill yourself, you won\u2019t go again, right?\u201d", "\u201cNo, that might not be the case.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m saying it depends on the people involved.\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied firmly.", "\u201cIf it\u2019s for a complete stranger, I won\u2019t go. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m some altruistic saint. But\u2026.\u201d", "He paused momentarily and stared at Kim Hannah.", "\u201cIf it\u2019s you who I need to save, then I\u2019ll go. No matter what I have to do.\u201d", "\u201cHa.\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked as if she had just heard the most absurd pickup line.", "\u201cAm I supposed to be touched?\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d", "\u201cThen tell me. I\u2019ve been asking you for a while now. Why?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not your family member or your girlfriend. I\u2019m just one of your acquaintances.\u201d", "It was clear to anyone listening in that Kim Hannah still couldn\u2019t understand.", "\u201cSo why are you saying you\u2019d save me? What\u2019s the reason?\u201d", "\u201cThe Golden Rule.\u201d", "Tap. The tapping stopped. Seeing Kim Hannah\u2019s frozen index finger, Seol Jihu smiled gently.", "\u201cBecause you are my Golden Commandment.\u201d", "Kim Hannah stared at him in a daze.", "\u201cI, I don\u2019t understand what that means.\u201d", "She shook her head as she muttered in a raspy voice. Seol Jihu suddenly opened his mouth.", "\u201cDo you remember the first time we met?\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you on about now?\u201d", "\u201cYou told me to reveal my secrets in exchange for the Invitation.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes widened and her mouth opened slightly.", "\u201cYou.\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s a part of that.\u201d", "\u201cHey, you better not be trying to gloss over this with some random bullshit. You\u2019re saying you can\u2019t tell me because you don\u2019t trust me.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that. In the first place, you\u2019re the one who approached me to use me.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said curtly.", "\u201cI had no intention of revealing my secrets. Not to you or anyone else.\u201d", "Since you\u2019re the one who made me fall into a pit of despair in my dream. He swallowed this line down.", "\u201cBut after seeing how you were treating me, I changed my mind. It\u2019s still changing. I\u2019m debating whether to tell you everything or not. I feel like I can trust you, but I can\u2019t be sure. I\u2019m in a constant struggle.\u201d", "Kim Hannah tilted her head. She looked up at the ceiling with a puzzled look.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2026. Haa.\u201d", "In the end, she turned her gaze back down and massaged her temples with her hands.", "\u201cAnyways.\u201d", "Seol Jihu continued to talk.", "\u201cWe established a new relationship back when we last met, and it\u2019s true that I\u2019m the one who broke our promise. I have nothing to say other than sorry.\u201d", "A long sigh rang out along with the murmuring, \u2018Golden Rule\u2026 Golden Rule\u2026.\u2019", "Soon.", "\u201c\u2026Okay, I think I get it.\u201d", "\u201cKim Hannah?\u201d", "\u201cShut up for a bit. I\u2019m still organizing my thoughts. So what you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019re justified in participating in that mission and that you\u2019re not addicted. Okay, fine, I get all that.\u201d", "Kim Hannah muttered in a somewhat feeble voice, then\u2026.", "\u201cBut you need to know this.\u201d", "She locked her fingers together and stared straight at him.", "\u201cThere is no incident without a problem. But not only are you actively looking for incidents, but you\u2019re also walking into them with your own two feet.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cQuiet. Do you know what I went through a few days ago? You and I are bound by a contract. Your actions have consequences that directly affect me. Whether those consequences are good or bad doesn\u2019t matter. I prefer not to be swept into things I can\u2019t handle any more than this.\u201d", "\u201cI promise. Something like this won\u2019t happen ever again.\u201d", "\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see about that. I\u2019m not the type of person who thinks people can be changed to my liking.\u201d", "Kim Hannah told him flat out but revealed a hesitant expression.", "\u201cBut\u2026 looking at you, I\u2019m starting to change my mind. At the very least, the Seol Jihu that\u2019s in front of me isn\u2019t the gambling addict I know. Right?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d", "\u201cBut you still broke our promise twice. I hate people who habitually break promises more than gambling addicts.\u201d", "Kim Hannah leaned forward.", "\u201cSo\u2026 Jihu.\u201d", "She grabbed Seol Jihu\u2019s hands and held them tightly.", "\u201cDon\u2019t disappoint me any more than this.\u201d", "The pressure coming from her palms seemed to say, \u2018There won\u2019t be a third time.\u2019", "\u201cPlease, knowing how special you think of me\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be a fox to you too.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s alias was Miss Foxy. Hugo even said she was one of the Six Crazies. Now that he was looking at her like this, he didn\u2019t feel like Hugo was joking. He slowly nodded his head, and only then did Kim Hannah let go of his hands.", "She glanced at the white envelope on the table.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "After a moment of hesitation, she carefully picked it up. Seol Jihu swallowed hard, watching the envelope disappear into Kim Hannah\u2019s purse.", "\u2018So this is the Golden Commandment?\u2019", "Treat others how you wanted to be treated. Seol Jihu trembled as he remembered these words. Until now, he only saw the \u2018Golden Commandment\u2019 in a positive way.", "Treat others like gold and you will receive gold. So what will happen if you treat others like trash?", "\u2018A double-edged blade.\u2019", "He felt like he was beginning to understand the concept of the Nine Eyes\u2019 right side. Having finished organizing her purse, Kim Hannah asked.", "\u201cBreakfast?\u201d", "\u201cH-Hm?\u201d", "\u201cHave you had breakfast?\u201d", "The air suddenly cooled down. Seol Jihu subconsciously let out the breath he had been holding in. He scratched his head and replied.", "\u201cNot yet.\u201d", "*", "After leaving the coffee shop, the duo headed to a restaurant. Kim Hannah introduced him to a high-class ginseng chicken soup place called \u2018Chicken Cloud Palace\u2019 and ended up watching Seol Jihu eat with a shocked expression.", "Nom, nom.", "Slurp, slurp, slurrrrp!", "He picked the chicken up whole and picked it apart piece by piece. Kim Hannah had never seen someone eat ginseng chicken soup as if it was a bowl of noodles.", "\u201cEat slower. You\u2019re going to have problems digesting all that.\u201d", "When she filled his empty cup with water, Seol Jihu paused for a moment and gulped it down in one shot. Kim Hannah shook her head, perhaps feeling bad about making him check for her reactions constantly.", "\u201cI won\u2019t say anything, so just eat. Eat to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d", "Rather than going back to stuffing his face with chicken, Seol Jihu grabbed a napkin and wiped his mouth.", "\u201cI have a question.\u201d", "\u201cWhat.\u201d", "\u201cDid something happen?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Why do you think something happened?\u201d", "\u201cToday, you were a bit more hysterical than usual.\u201d", "\u201cHys\u2026 What did you say?\u201d", "Kim Hannah eyes turned into daggers. Seol Jihu quickly changed the topic.", "\u201cI mean, you said so before. That you went through something a few days ago.\u201d", "Hearing this, Kim Hannah\u2019s glaring eyes loosened and was replaced by bitterness.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not something to talk about while eating.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t ruin my appetite.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smacked her lips.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 I met someone.\u201d", "\u201cWho?\u201d", "\u201cThe First Lady.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was about to take another bite out of the chicken but paused midway.", "\u201cBy First Lady, you mean\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWho do you think? She\u2019s Yun Seora\u2019s older sister.\u201d", "\u201cHer? What, did she beat you up or something?\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s not like that.\u201d", "Kim Hannah chuckled and took out a document the size of an A4 paper from her purse.", "\u201cHere, it\u2019s 252.5 million won. I sold it for 500 silver coins.\u201d", "\u201cSold what?\u201d", "\u201cThe ornament you gave me, stupid.\u201d", "Seol Jihu dropped the chicken.", "\u201cR-Really?\u201d", "\u201cYep. I already converted it to Earth\u2019s currency. You understand why, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was about to shout, \u2018Of course, I do! It\u2019s not like I\u2019m short on money in Paradise!\u2019 but he didn\u2019t and fell into deep thought. It didn\u2019t look like Kim Hannah was all that happy about it.", "\u201cDid someone steal the money?\u201d", "\u201cI would have preferred that, actually. That way, I would have something over them.\u201d", "What was that supposed to mean? Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t quite understand what she was talking about, so he decided to just listen for now.", "\u201cThis problem actually started from you spending the 100 million won I gave you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu immediately coughed, and Kim Hannah burst into laughter.", "\u201cAnyways, I planned to give this money to you over the course of three years.\u201d", "\u201cThree years?\u201d", "\u201cYeah. Like a salary, I planned to give you 4 million every month and give out the rest through various bonuses and benefits.\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked repeatedly before going, \u201cAh!\u201d", "\u201cYou were trying to make it look like I got a job! Like Sinyoung\u2019s system.\u201d", "That was good news for him. When he visited his parents before, he told them he got a job. But the reality was that he would be at a loss for words if they started asking him about it.", "Once they began asking questions like \u2018what company do you work for?\u2019, \u2018let me see your contract\u2019, or \u2018let me see your bank account\u2019, they would discover the truth in no time.", "But with a fake job, everything would be resolved. Given Kim Hannah\u2019s skills, she would have undoubtedly come up with a legit source for the 100 million won she gave him.", "\u201cYou\u2019re really smart when it comes to things like this.\u201d", "Kim Hannah snorted at Seol Jihu\u2019s compliment and continued.", "\u201cRight, I wanted to arrange a secure source of money for you and give you a secure environment so that you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about life on this side. So I wanted to push you into a foreign company I trust, but\u2026.\u2019"]}
