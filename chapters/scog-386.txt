Do you remember how I told Lady Seo Yuhui that I disinfected my hands before coming here? In the past, whenever she had an unavoidable reason to be touched by someone, she made sure they didn\u2019t have a speck of dust on their hands.\u201d", "The bishop raised his left hand and smiled.", "\u201cShe even wiped her hands at the end of every battle. It\u2019s certainly odd, but she took care of it meticulously so that it didn\u2019t bring harm to others.\u201d", "It was hard to believe that Seo Yuhui was such a clean freak.", "Suddenly wondering what Seo Yuhui was like in the past, Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, isn\u2019t it?

How did you know?\u201d", "\u201cRepresentative Seol returning to Paradise has been the talk of the town for a while. To tell you the truth, I was jumping from joy when I heard the news. Initially, when I heard that you were gone for eight months, I was worried that you retired from Paradise.\u201d", "The bishop then added with a hearty laugh, \u201cWhat would we do if the only one capable of combating the Parasites disappeared?\u201d", "\u201cTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t the time to be throwing a party.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly.", "\u201cI invested eight months of time and returned empty-handed\u2026 But I couldn\u2019t really say no when it was obvious that my friends were throwing the party to cheer me up.\u201d", "\u201cReturning empty-handed after investing eight months of your time\u2026?

I found out about it while I was searching for a way to save Lady Seo Yuhui. I remembered the item being in the VIP store of the Neutral Zone, so I had my subordinates check. It turned out that someone already purchased the item. I believe the buyer\u2019s name was Eun Yuri.\u201d", "The bishop gave a sharp look.", "Seol Jihu closed his eyes and sighed.", "\u201cI would have used Moirai\u2019s Souvenir\u2026 if I still had it.\u201d", "\u201cDoes that mean you no longer have it in your possession?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right.

The reason that Army Commanders usually have their divinities sealed.\u201d", "\u201cOf course. When they release it, they can display power rivaling a god on the basis of terrifying holy power, but the duration is short and they need a long time to recover afterward\u2026\u201d", "\u201cExactly. Moirai\u2019s Souvenir was a secret weapon that aimed for this weakness. After pushing the Army Commander to a corner and forcing them to release their divinity, we planned to inject the near-infinite amount of holy power that Moirai\u2019s Souvenir carried and amplify the fundamental imbalance in the Army Commander\u2019s energies.\u201d", "\u201cHoh, that\u2019s quite the method\u2026 And what was the result?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m standing here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201cUnfortunately, there were two Army Commanders inside the Spirit Realm. Not one. We had no choice but to use Moirai\u2019s Souvenir.\u201d", "Seol Jihu continued calmly.", "\u201cYou may not know this, but our success in saving the Spirit Realm was a miracle that resulted from a series of coincidences. We were on the brink of complete destruction and had to use every card in our arsenal to survive.\u201d", "The bishop nodded his head.", "\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened\u2026 Not much is known about what happened in the Spirit Realm, so this old man misunderstood.\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d", "\u201cBefore I apologize, there\u2019s one more thing I\u2019d like to ask.\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows, but the bishop continued unfazed.", "\u201cI believe Representative Seol has received an incredible amount of contribution points from this war. So I\u2019m wondering\u2026\u201d", "As the bishop trailed off suggestively, Seol Jihu shook his head again.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re asking why I didn\u2019t use contribution points to save Yuhui Noona, I can only tell you that I didn\u2019t have enough.\u201d", "The bishop\u2019s eyes lit up.", "\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s surprising.\u201d", "\u201cHave you used a Divine Wish before, bishop?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never amassed contribution points to that degree.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve used it once before.\u201d", "\u201cTo revive that Magician named Eun Yuri, correct?\u201d", "\u2018So he even knows about that?\u2019 Seol Jihu murmured inwardly before continuing.", "\u201cYes. it was thanks to the contribution points I gained by personally killing Undying Diligence in the Arden Valley War.\u201d", "\u201cMm. Then how come this time\u2014\u201d", "\u201cDo you know on what basis contribution points are given out?\u201d", "\u201cI doubt you\u2019re asking for the obvious answer\u2026\u201d", "The bishop thought for a moment before doing a double-take.", "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, but Eun Yuri who bought Moirai\u2019s Souvenir. The Priests within my organization were the ones who used it. And it was Mister Ayase Kazuki who forced Raging Temperance to unleash his divinity.\u201d", "Seol Jihu seized the initiative before the bishop could say anything.", "\u201cThe same goes for the other items used in the last war. To be honest, I didn\u2019t do much. Passing through the Astral World? It was thanks to the Halep siblings. Reviving the World Tree? Mister Marcel Ghionea risked his life to achieve that. I probably don\u2019t need to mention the Tigol Fortress War.\u201d", "The bishop\u2019s head spun.", "This wasn\u2019t too hard to believe given that Seol Jihu was only Level 5, but this was also the man who had killed the First Army Commander.", "But at the Arden Valley War, Seol Jihu had used an Awakening Skill using his life as collateral, and Seo Yuhui\u2019s current state was a direct result of trying to save him from death.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s explanation made perfect sense if, as a result, both Seo Yuhui and Seol Jihu could no longer use the Awakening Skills they did back then.", "\u201cOf course, I received some compensation. I did contribute to a good degree in that war, after all.\u201d", "Still, his contribution was a lot more indirect compared to personally killing Undying Diligence. As a result, the contribution points he received were far less in comparison.", "That was Seol Jihu\u2019s explanation.", "\u201cPeople around me hail me as a hero, but\u2026 I\u2019m really just an average guy who got incredibly lucky.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke self-mockingly with a bitter smile.", "The bishop listened quietly before replying.", "\u201c\u2026Can you tell me what you have been up to these past eight months?\u201d", "Seol Jihu smoothed down his face with his hands as if he was tired of the bishop\u2019s unceasing questions.", "\u201c\u2026I tried to infiltrate the Empire.\u201d", "\u201cThe Empire\u2026 You mean the Parasites\u2019 territory?\u201d", "\u201cYes. I wanted to use my remaining contribution points to facilitate Yuhui Noona\u2019s recovery. Since I didn\u2019t have enough to use a Divine Wish, I had to think of another method. So I pleaded with Gula, asking her to tell me how to save Yuhui Noona in exchange for contribution points.\u201d", "\u201cYou said you found a way?\u201d", "\u201cThankfully, yes. Gula told me of a location where a large number of offerings are buried. It was in a region where the old Rothschear Clan, known as the Spear of the Empire, resided.\u201d", "\u201cRothschear? Isn\u2019t that one of the Four Great Clans of the old Empire and the clan that was wiped out by the Gorgonu Clan?\u201d", "The bishop spoke as if he didn\u2019t expect to hear the name \u2018Rothschear\u2019.", "Seol Jihu also stared at the bishop with a look of surprise. It seemed he wasn\u2019t just capable in politics, but was also well-versed in Paradise\u2019s history.", "\u201cThe Rothschear Clan\u2019s offerings\u2026 That makes sense. They were the ones who served Castitas\u2026\u201d", "As the bishop murmured to himself, Seol Jihu suppressed the impulse to clutch onto the pendant that was shaking inside his clothes.", "\u201cTrying to infiltrate the Empire must mean that this location is within the Parasites\u2019 territory.\u201d", "\u201cExactly.\u201d", "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take anyone with you? This hardly seems like a place you should go alone.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t have anyone to ask. But I couldn\u2019t force myself to drag my comrades who were already worn-out from war. I also judged it was better to move with a few people rather than a large group.\u201d", "\u201cAh, you must have thought the Parasites wouldn\u2019t be on guard after their huge defeat.\u201d", "\u201cMy biggest oversight was thinking that they wouldn\u2019t recover so quickly.\u201d", "After reaching this point, Seol Jihu heaved out a deep sigh.", "\u201c\u2026Is that enough?\u201d", "The bishop didn\u2019t answer. He was simply rubbing his chin with his head lowered. This seemed like a subconscious habit that came out while he was ruminating.", "\u201cHm, hm, hmm, hmmmm.\u201d", "He tilted his head left and right before turning to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cMy, my\u2026\u201d", "A faint smile seemed to be hanging on his face.", "\u201cIt looks like I owe you an apology.\u201d", "He seemed strangely satisfied.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t try to help. You simply couldn\u2019t. I understand now. I honestly wasn\u2019t thinking so highly of you before, but now that I know the full story\u2026 I apologize. I am sincerely sorry.\u201d", "The bishop continued.", "\u201cIf I may give an excuse, didn\u2019t you hear that I wanted to meet with you?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I did.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to discuss the matter regarding Lady Seo Yuhui with Representative Seol for a few months now. Since I would be taking a sizable loss, I had to make sure Representative Seol was someone I could trust, so that was why I asked so many interrogative questions.\u201d", "\u201cLoss?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Anyway, I\u2019ve confirmed Representative Seol\u2019s sincerity. Since there is no use apologizing with mere words, I will show my sincerity as well.\u201d", "The bishop smiled and spoke.", "\u201cHave you heard of Gorad Boga?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cIt refers to the location in this world that was ruled by its first god after their birth. It is a legend that has been passed down since the Mythical Era, long before the time of the Empire. On Earth, this place would be similar to the legendary city of Atlantis or the City of God.\u201d", "\u201cCity of God\u2026\u201d", "\u201cAs a land that was once ruled by a god, it naturally carries miraculous energy. To Priests who use holy power rather than mana, this is the most ideal place.\u201d", "\u201cAre you talking about areas like Mount Pel\u00e9eom\u2019s volcanic region?\u201d", "\u201cAh, the place Lady Seo Yuhui visits often to pray. Yes, that is correct. It\u2019s great that you have an idea. But the place I am talking about is incomparable to that place. The density of vital energy should be hundreds of times greater at the very least.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cH-Hundreds of times?\u201d", "\u201cThink of it as a small achievement I made while Representative Seol was working hard.\u201d", "The bishop smiled thinly and then cleared his throat.", "\u201cGetting right to the point, I\u2019ve found the place that is presumed to be Gorad Boga. No, I\u2019m certain. I went there personally using the excuse of offering prayers.\u201d", "The bishop glanced at Seol Jihu who was clearly excited.", "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It was like lumps of highly concentrated vital energy were scattered everywhere like ordinary rocks. It should be more than enough for Lady Seo Yuhui to fully recover.\u201d", "\u201cIs that true?\u201d", "\u201cYes!

Because Lady Seo Yuhui will refuse to go if you tell her the information came from me.\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s because I am someone who lost her trust.

In fact, you can even say that I hate her.\u201d", "The bishop admitted.", "\u201cBut I am sincere in wanting to save her. I can only keep my position if that wench dies.
