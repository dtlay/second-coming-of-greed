Enough!]", "\u2026The Parasite Queen flew into a fit of rage.", "Although varying by the situation, the tactic most frequently used by the Parasites was to crush their enemy with absolute force. And this tactic had worked well for them so far because of their troops\u2019 superiority to the enemy, both in terms of number and strength.", "But today, they lost in a fight of pure strength, which they took immense pride in. And that too, against only one person.", "She thought the fish was as good as caught, and the rest would be easy because they had cornered the prey.", "But the enemy was destroying the Parasites with even more overwhelming force. She had never felt more humiliated.", "The Parasite Queen tilted her head back and looked up at the sky.", "Rumble!", "There was a starquake. The tremors of stars accompanied by a massive explosion caused the sky to shake violently.", "At the center of the tremor, which was the center of the celestial sphere, was a star burning brighter than ever.

A small sigh escaped her lips.", "The stimulus called the Parasites seemed to have driven the star into a frenzy, and it was blazing furiously like there was no tomorrow.", "She knew well the nature of a supernova and expected something like this to happen, but even so, the intensity of his reaction was simply outrageous.", "[The First Army Commander was right\u2026.]", "It was fortunate that she listened to Sung Shihyun\u2019s advice and didn\u2019t hastily move her forces.", "The Parasite Queen fell into deep thought.", "To be honest, killing him wasn\u2019t hard. Even the Brightest Star wouldn\u2019t survive, for example, if she sent all the Army Commanders to him and ordered them to release their divinities at once.", "The problem was that killing him was not enough.", "Of course, there was no doubt that killing him even once would be a great accomplishment, but all would be pointless if he returned.", "Thus the Parasites had to first render his body unusable before killing him for good to take advantage of the Earthlings\u2019 revival setting.", "Sung Shihyun was right. They should focus on one goal and pursue efficiency only for that goal.", "Twisted Kindness was also right. Rather than oppressing the enemy with pure force, they needed to rely on systematic planning.", "So clearly, the first thing they had to do at this point was to bring the enemy down a notch or two.

Are you out of your mind!?\u201d", "Little Chick yelled in anger. He couldn\u2019t think of one reason that could justify Seol Jihu\u2019s action. They still had a long way to go, and Seol Jihu just knocked out a Level 8 Priestess, a quarter of their party, seconds before a decisive battle.", "And she wasn\u2019t just anyone.

You crazy bastard!\u201d", "Little Chick screamed at the top of his lungs.", "\u201cI had no choice.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head with a bitter expression.", "\u201cFuck you!

Instead, she suffered horrible torture that made death look like a bliss.", "At the end of the vision, he saw that she had become a mother species that gave birth to gods, living a wretched life as a slave to the Parasites and not even permitted to die.", "When he saw Seo Yuhui\u2019s body swelled like a Nest and her face barely recognizable over the bumpy surface of her skin while tears of agony trickled down her cheeks, the shock he experienced was like a punch in the gut.", "She would have lived if she ran away. But because she came back, a new future, that of \u2018Attention Required\u2019, was formed.", "And he couldn\u2019t let that future happen. Not to Seo Yuhui. She had to live.", "Fortunately, he knew there was a future in which she survives.

The Parasites\u2019 target wasn\u2019t the stele. It was him all along.", "So there still was a way for her to survive. He just had to get Seo Yuhui to leave before it was too late.", "But he knew no matter how hard he tried, the odds of Seo Yuhui doing as he said were zero. She said so herself that she would die with him than leave him.", "When Seol Jihu saw the word \u2018Determined\u2019 under her \u2018Level of Cognition\u2019, he gave up trying to persuade her. There was no time to argue anyway.", "In the end, he was left with one choice: force Seo Yuhui to leave even if it went against her will.", "Thankfully Flone and Little Chick were here.", "\u201cLittle Chick, listen to me carefully. You too, Flone.\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked down at Little Chick, who was still yelling at the top of his lungs.", "\u201cTake Yuhui with you and get as far away from here as possible.

If anything unexpected happens, please protect Yuhui with Little Chick. Don\u2019t let her come back to me even if she wakes up in the middle. You know what? Just knock her out again if she shows any signs of regaining consciousness. Do that until you arrive in the city.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s voice was low but sharp. His expression showed steely determination as if to leave no room for objection.", "[Then\u2026 then what about you?]", "Flone asked in a stutter.", "\u201cI\u2019ll take a different route than the three of you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu continued with a sigh.", "\u201cI understand this is confusing for you.

The four of us have to combine our powers, and even then, that might not be enough to defeat them! Do you really think you can do this alone?\u201d", "Little Chick burst out in rage in a hoarse voice.", "\u201cLet the ghost over there take her! You need at least one ally! I\u2019m your partner!\u201d", "But Seol Jihu shook his head.", "In his vision, he saw both Flone and Little Chick around Seo Yuhui. With even one of them missing, the entire future could change.", "Most importantly, the fact that Sung Shihyun chose Seo Yuhui as his first harem member bothered him.", "\u201cCan\u2019t you fulfill your partner\u2019s last wish?\u201d", "Little Chick tried to shout something, then stopped. He realized through Seol Jihu\u2019s choice of words that his partner was ready to risk even death.", "He had chosen Seo Yuhui over his life.", "At that moment, they heard the long cry of a Banshee.", "While they were arguing, the Parasites had come close enough to be seen.", "Their time was running out, and Little Chick had to make a choice: comply with the request or ignore it.", "\u201cKeuaaaa! You damned fool! I\u2019ve never met a partner like you!\u201d", "Realizing it was too late to persuade Seol Jihu, Little Chick roared and then pulled out one red and one navy feather from his forehead and threw them at his partner.", "Woooong!", "The Spear of Purity absorbed the two feathers and began to shine brightly.", "[Crescent Blade Spear Technique, Fourth Ultimate Art \u2014 Mind Spear \u2014 has been awakened.]", "[Crescent Blade Spear Technique, Fifth Ultimate Art \u2014 Limitlessness \u2014 has been awakened.]", "In the face of a never-before-seen danger, the Spear of Purity was awakened to its fifth stage.", "Other than the first head of the House of the Rothschear, the first owner of the Spear of Purity, Seol Jihu was the first partner for whom the Arcus Spirit had unlocked the fifth stage of the spear.", "Seol Jihu looked at the Spear of Purity, surrounded in mystic energy, with a slightly surprised expression on his face before glancing down at Little Chick.", "\u201cWhat about the Sixth and the Seventh?\u201d", "\u201cYou ungrateful rascal! I can\u2019t, even if I want to! You should\u2019ve evolved me to the final stage before all this happened!\u201d", "Little Chick shouted angrily and then clenched its beak.", "\u201cYou. Come back alive no matter what. What happened just now is a special treatment. I\u2019ve allowed it because of the present circumstances, but that doesn\u2019t mean you passed the test. Got it?\u201d", "Seol Jihu smirked. Talking about passing the test when he had yet to take one was absurd, but he wasn\u2019t dense enough to disregard Little Chick\u2019s true feelings.", "\u201cAlright. Thanks.\u201d", "Seol Jihu winked at his partner and grabbed his spear.", "Little Chick glanced at Flone. She was still in the middle of a panic attack.", "\u201cDamn it!\u201d", "A bright light burst out from Little Chick\u2019s body.", "Seol Jihu put the pendant around Seo Yuhui\u2019s neck and laid her on top of Little Chick, now in the phoenix form.", "Guilt tugged at his heart as he looked down at her face, dark with worry even though she was unconscious.", "\u201cI\u2019m counting on you.\u201d", "[\u2026Damn it!]", "Little Chick cursed yet again, flapping his wings.", "Flap! The phoenix rose slowly into the air until he finally began to fly in a direction entirely different from Seol Jihu\u2019s escape route.", "[I, I can\u2019t\u2026.]", "But Flone hadn\u2019t left yet. Her gaze wavered between Seol Jihu, who stood in front of her, and the phoenix, who was getting farther and farther away.", "She couldn\u2019t bring herself to depart. Because if she did, then Seol Jihu would be all alone.", "[I, I want to stay here!]", "But she couldn\u2019t. Flone was needed to make the blue vision become a reality. Also, Little Chick couldn\u2019t retain the phoenix form for long. They had to take turns flying while protecting Seo Yuhui.", "[I\u2019m gonna stay! I\u2019m dead anyway! So it\u2019s okay!]", "Flone began to beg a moment too late.", "But she was bound to her pendant.", "[No! You promised me we\u2019d be together forever!]", "As the distance between her and the pendant grew, she was forcefully pulled toward her abode.", "[Meanie\u2026!]", "Seol Jihu quietly waved his hand at Flone as she moved away, struggling.", "The two soon became mere dots in the sky.", "Only then did Seol Jihu turn his head forward and prepare for the battle.", "He was relieved of a big worry. All that was left now was\u2026.", "\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019", "The pair of eyes glaring at the army of the Parasites slowly began to turn crimson.", "After a brief pause, Seol Jihu kicked the ground with a great force and rushed toward the enemy with his mouth wide open.", "\u2014Heuaaaaaaah!", "Berserk\u2019s roar shook the air.", "\u2014Kiaaaaaaaaaa!", "Exploding Patience\u2019s shriek followed.", "FLASH!", "A giant light shone over everything in the vicinity. Screams erupted, lightning flashed, curses were chanted, and supernovas exploded, rocking the earth.", "Amidst the agony and thundering explosions\u2026.", "[Damn it!]", "The Arcus Spirit left everything behind and flapped his wings faster.", "[Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!]", "He yelled louder each time he heard an explosion to force himself to focus on flying and not turn back.", "Finally, when the noise subsided, the Arcus Spirit pulled out his long neck and glanced behind his shoulder. It was quieter now, but he could still sense a fight in the distance.", "[Damn\u2026 it\u2026.]", "Having sensed a brutal brawl, the Arcus Spirit\u2019s face fell in sadness."]}
