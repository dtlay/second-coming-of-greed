Little information has been revealed to the public, so they added some unnecessary self-assessments.\u201d", "His calm tone made it sound like there was no way the broker would turn himself in. As Seol Jihu had a bit more knowledge regarding the event, he was slightly surprised.", "But then again, anyone would get suspicious if someone who was hell-bent on hiding himself suddenly turned himself in.", "At the very least, someone who was knowledgeable about the inner workings of Paradise would easily guess that some kind of outside interference had occurred.", "What would be difficult would be pinpointing Kim Hannah as the perpetrator.", "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t like this in the beginning.\u201d", "Jang Maldong heaved out a deep sigh.", "\u201cHe sheepishly laughed even when someone criticized him.

However, Bok Jungsik was nowhere to be found. He had gone into hiding.", "With Charlie Haber confessing and providing evidence, claiming to be innocent would only be disgraceful. In a way, his quick decision to run showed how experienced he was in Paradise.", "Regardless, running away was akin to admitting guilt, and Bok Jungsik\u2019s claim had lost all credibility.", "Naturally, Phi Sora\u2019s statement came into the spotlight once again.", "Although it was true that she forced the expedition, anyone who knew the inner workings of White Rose saw that this was Bok Jungsik\u2019s plot.", "The focal point fell on Bok Jungsik who ran away, and now that Phi Sora had some room to breathe, it was unlikely that all the blame would fall on her shoulders.", "At the very least, she was absolved of the charge of willful negligence.", "The matter came to a close for now with the Scheherazade Royal Family issuing the Red Notice for Bok Jungsik.", "If there was something that went outside of Seol Jihu\u2019s expectations\u2026", "That would be that Phi Sora didn\u2019t avoid responsibility by saying \u2018I was only being used\u2019, and that she \u2018temporarily\u2019 rose to the position of the leader of White Rose.", "While she was only acting a leader temporarily, taking this position was equivalent to announcing that she would settle this incident.", "Another thing that surprised Seol Jihu was that White Rose\u2019s \u2018temporary leader\u2019 contacted him personally.", "*", "Seol Jihu set off for Scheherazade as soon as he received the call.", "Jang Maldong periodically told him about the situation White Rose was in, and Phi Sora\u2019s actions could only be described as a series of surprises.", "Seol Jihu was expecting her to rebuild White Rose from bottom-up, but she officially announced its dissolution. As if to show the world her fiery temper, she did not stop at just saying this but was supposedly doing everything in her power to put it into action.", "For Seol Jihu, who was eagerly waiting for her to go broke, this wasn\u2019t such happy news.", "On the other hand, he got curious. What Phi Sora was doing was equivalent to narrowly stopping a piggy bank from falling on the ground and shattering, and then raising it up high and slamming it down on the ground.", "\u2018Couldn\u2019t she have just stayed silent?\u2019", "Why was she trying to destroy White Rose with her own hands? It didn\u2019t seem like it was simply out of anger.", "Seol Jihu kept tilting his head as he entered Scheherazade.", "White Rose Guild lacked any semblance of liveliness. Not only did no one enter and leave the building, only one or two people could be seen walking around inside. But from the way they were packing their belongings, even they seemed to be getting ready to leave.", "With no one to guide him, Seol Jihu searched his memories and walked around the building.", "Phi Sora was waiting inside the conference room.", "After briefly exchanging greetings, Seol Jihu spoke as he sat down on the chair opposite to Phi Sora.", "\u201cThis place is pretty empty.\u201d", "\u201cI let everyone go.\u201d", "Phi Sora spoke fleetingly.", "\u201cPeople who wanted to leave left, people with time left in their contracts were transferred elsewhere, and the hired-for-help had their contracts canceled\u2026.\u201d", "She slowly blurred the end of her speech before looking side to side.", "\u201cWe have to leave this place by the end of the day as well.\u201d", "Seol Jihu doubted his ears.", "\u201cWe finished negotiating with PAX. The land belongs to the Scheherazade Royal Family, so there\u2019s nothing we could do about that; but the money from the transfers, our shared assets, and this building itself will all be handed over to them.\u201d", "\u201cDid you really have to go that far?\u201d", "\u201cTechnically, the incident hasn\u2019t ended yet. In Paradise, coming to an agreement is incredibly important. More so than you might think.\u201d", "Phi Sora hesitated for a moment before continuing.", "\u201cAnd it\u2019s true that I pushed for the expedition on my own.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cNo buts. I didn\u2019t know this would happen, but what I did should get me charged with manslaughter. Well, I can technically be shameless all I want, like a certain someone, but I don\u2019t want to.\u201d", "Phi Sora crossed her arms.", "\u201cIt would have been a different story if PAX persisted on having things their way, but thanks to that Bok bastard quickly running away, they reluctantly accepted this offer. They must know it too. That resolving this matter cleanly is much better than rolling in the mud to possess me\u2026.

Personally, no less.\u201d", "Trying to sound like he was chatting casually, he stealthily raised a question.", "\u201cIs it\u2026 revenge?\u201d", "Phi Sora immediately let out a snort.", "\u201cRevenge? I doubt that bastard will return to Paradise ever again. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be too busy keeping himself safe on Earth.\u201d", "This was somewhat frightening considering that PAX was an international organization.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have regrets. It\u2019s just that\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora tapped on the desk a couple of times.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been with White Rose since the day I stepped into Paradise.

Since it was able to reach its current height with my help, I think I have the right to put an end to it myself.\u201d", "From her words, Seol Jihu could feel the affection she had for White Rose.

Ever.\u201d", "She emphasized this line.", "\u201cThis is the end.\u201d", "\u2018The end?\u2019", "It sounded like she was compressing a whole lot of meaning into this one word, but Seol Jihu nodded his head without digging any further.", "\u201cThen you\u2019re leaving today?\u201d", "\u201cYes, today will be my last day here too. I\u2019ll leave as soon as I finish the negotiations.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped slightly.", "\u2018This person.\u2019", "How could she be so impatient? Was she a bulldozer?", "Taking Seol Jihu\u2019s intent stare the wrong way, Phi Sora shrugged.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Given my level and experience, do you think it will be difficult for me to find a new home? I already know where I\u2019m going\u2026. No, wait, why am I telling you all this?\u201d", "She grumbled in a low voice before taking two pieces of paper out of her pocket. She flicked her hand, and the paper pieces flew like paper airplanes and landed in front of Seol Jihu.", "Next, a pen rolled toward him.", "Seol Jihu grabbed the pen and carefully studied the paper before asking.", "\u201cWhat do you mean by joint ownership?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. That Bok bastard is the one who scouted Yi Seol-Ah and Yi Sungjin, but I\u2019m the one who procured their stamps with my contribution points.\u201d", "Since Bok Jungsik abandoned his rights and escaped, the authority over the siblings naturally fell on Phi Sora. Hearing this explanation, Seol Jihu was rather relieved.", "Even if riches were scattered on the side of a road, it was a crime to pick them up when they had a rightful owner. Likewise, even if Seol Jihu brought the siblings with him, if their contractual owner showed up in the future and claimed his right over them, Seol Jihu wouldn\u2019t be able to say a thing.", "So, it was much better to take care of the matter now when he had the opportunity.", "After all, the negotiation was an important process, just like Phi Sora said.", "\u201cThen about the transfer fee\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t need much.\u201d", "Phi Sora answered quickly.", "\u201cYou can probably tell by how empty this place is.

It\u2019s different on a case-by-case basis.
