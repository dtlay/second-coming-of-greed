With a skilled High Ranker Archer and a Warrior joining in, Seol Jihu felt much more confident in succeeding.", "That night, Seol Jihu revealed the expedition plan to his teammates. He told them about the information he gathered at the library and surprised them by mentioning Kazuki and Teresa would be coming along.", "Of course, it was normal procedure to first tell one\u2019s teammates about an expedition before recruiting any additional help, but it didn\u2019t matter all that much, because Chohong and Hugo were already heated up and impatient.", "Their reactions were pretty much what Seol Jihu expected.", "\u201cAgree, agree, I super agree!\u201d", "\u201cKyaa! We\u2019ll finally get our hands on some money!\u201d", "Chohong shot her hands up and danced, while Hugo laughed with a big grin.", "Meanwhile, Marcel Ghionea looked at these two strangely.", "Normally, explorations and expeditions were more likely to fail than succeed. In terms of pure numbers, failure to success ratio was about 7:3.", "But the way Chohong and Hugo were acting, it was as if they had already finished the expedition in success. They seemed sure that there was a ruin there.", "Jang Maldong, who was silently staring at the map, muttered in a low voice.", "\u201cThe border region\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu raised his eyebrows.", "\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d", "\u201cYou should be careful, obviously, but just going there shouldn\u2019t pose any problems. After all, it\u2019s just the border region. But you should be careful not to go too deep since this place practically has a foot in the Federation\u2019s territory.\u201d", "\u201cDoes the Federation hate humans intruding on their territory?\u201d", "\u201cIt depends. Some races are more generous and understanding of humans, but others are hostile. They may let you go without causing trouble if they know you\u2019re just passing by, or they might continue to chase after you, thinking that you\u2019re invading.\u201d", "\u201cBut we have a tacit alliance, don\u2019t we? Shouldn\u2019t it be okay as long as we don\u2019t attack them first?\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke optimistically, but Jang Maldong shook his head immediately.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a tacit relationship for a reason. It isn\u2019t as if humans have never warred with the Federation. In the first place, the Federation is a huge assembly of nations made up of countless races. Although their members are largely categorized into five groups, that\u2019s only for convenience\u2019s sake. If you go into detail, just the Beastmen Alliance has\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong looked up at the ceiling, starting to fold his fingers one by one, before ultimately shaking his head.", "\u201cAnyways, you best not do anything stupid. Different races have different values and views toward humanity. It\u2019s important to handle the situation on a case by case basis.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head at Jang Maldong\u2019s advice.", "\u201cIn that sense, asking Miss Teresa to accompany you was an excellent choice, since the Haramark Royal Family is in constant contact with the Federation\u2026. Also\u2026\u201d", "Jang Maldong then glanced at the brother and sister who were quietly sitting on the side.", "\u201cWhat are you going to do about them?\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked at them nervously. Yi Sungjin seemed keen on following them, while he couldn\u2019t really get a read on anything from Yi Seol-Ah\u2019s expression.", "Seol Jihu spoke.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s still too early. It would be a different story if we were going to the human territory, but this expedition will be to the border region of the three powers. Even though the Parasites are biding their time right now, if something goes wrong\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu blurred the end of his speech, as a glint of disappointment flickered in Yi Sungjin\u2019s eyes and Yi Seol-Ah let out a furtive sigh.", "For some reason, he could hear Phi Sora snorting from the side.", "\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s too dangerous. They need to be Level 4 at the very least. This isn\u2019t a place where a Level 1 or 2 can go.\u201d", "Hearing this\u2026", "\u201cHugo, I know a person who insisted on going to the border region of the three powers when he was only a Level 1. You remember him?\u201d", "Chohong asked.", "\u201cAh! I know him. That guy, didn\u2019t he join the war and volunteered himself to bait the Parasites all on his own? When he was Level 1.\u201d", "And Hugo replied right away.", "Seol Jihu ignored them and continued.", "\u201cIt\u2019s good to get experience points, but like you said, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We won\u2019t be able to look after them in the worst-case scenario.\u201d", "\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll train them some more while you\u2019re away, then.\u201d", "Jang Maldong clenched his teeth and replied. It looked like he was trying his best to restrain his laughter.", "Then, when Seol Jihu glared at the giggling Chohong and Hugo, Hugo held his laughter back and asked.", "\u201cSeol, are we not bringing a Priest?\u201d", "\u201cOf course, we are. I plan to go see her tomorrow morning.\u201d", "\u201cYou plan to go see her? Is it\u2026 Maria?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head, and Chohong and Hugo immediately stopped laughing. Then, they put on reluctant looks.", "\u201cUh, mm\u2026 I don\u2019t know if that will be okay.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. She kinda went crazy after the war ended\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes shot open.", "\u201cMiss Maria went crazy?\u201d", "Hugo shrugged.", "\u201cI still don\u2019t get why. She blabbered on about being crazy for investing in a rising stock and then going broke when the stock delisted\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. He realized that he had completely forgotten about Maria until now.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go see her tomorrow to take a look. If she\u2019s acting strange, then\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu muttered vaguely as if what he heard was too hard to believe.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll set out five days from now. I\u2019ll let Princess Teresa and Mister Kazuki know, so please be ready.\u201d", "\u201cRoger!\u201d", "\u201cOkay~!\u2019", "Chohong shot up and shouted, while Phi Sora answered with her interlocked hands stretched up.", "Jang Maldong turned to the Yi siblings and spoke.", "\u201cYou two get ready to leave too.\u201d", "\u201cHuh? But we\u2019re not\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNot to the expedition, but to Huge Stone Rocky Mountain.\u201d", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "Yi Sungjin hiccuped.", "Marcel Ghionea clasped his hands and prayed for the siblings.", "Seol Jihu did not miss Yi Seol-Ah glancing at the stretching Phi Sora.", "Now was a good time to tell her.", "\u201cSeol-Ah, can you talk to me for a bit?\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Ah, yes!\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah replied before smiling brightly and jumping up.", "*", "Seol Jihu brought Yi Seol-Ah to the rooftop.", "\u201cYou want to go with us, right?\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 haha.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah neither agreed nor disagreed, only smiling awkwardly.", "\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I would bring you along if I could, but this is the first time I will be on an expedition like this. We have very little information about this place.\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t that too dangerous?\u201d", "\u201cIt is. But we have to go.\u201d", "Seol Jihu thought about telling her regarding the move to Eva before deciding otherwise. There was no need to count the chickens before the eggs hatched.", "It wouldn\u2019t be too late to tell her after the expedition.", "\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know it\u2019s because I\u2019m not skilled enough. I\u2019ll train hard while you\u2019re away.\u201d", "\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s go together next time for sure.\u201d", "Unlike Yi Sungjin, she didn\u2019t look too disappointed. Seol Jihu decided to move on to the main topic.", "\u201cAlso, it\u2019s about Miss Phi Sora.\u201d", "The smiling Yi Seol-Ah immediately froze.", "\u201cIt looks like we\u2019ll be working together for a while.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah shut her eyes tight. She had expected as much, but hearing it still made her choke up.", "\u201cWhile it may not be immediate, there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll recruit her. I wasn\u2019t going to ask for your opinion originally, but I changed my mind after the war. Miss Phi Sora also clearly said what she wanted to.\u201d", "Seol Jihu talked about how Carpe Diem wasn\u2019t in a situation to be picky and how even one more powerful Earthling would make a huge difference.", "Yi Seol-Ah gave a forced smile.", "\u201cEi, you don\u2019t need to tell us everything down to the last detail. Just do what you want to. I\u2019m totally fine.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared at Yi Seol-Ah fixedly.", "\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t worry about it too much. What happened in White Rose won\u2019t happen again. I made sure to tell her.\u201d", "\u201cWhat if she does!? I won\u2019t sit still this time either!\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah clenched her fists and spoke confidently.", "Seol Jihu let out a small laugh.", "\u201cI know the history between you two, so I won\u2019t tell you to get along. But\u2026\u201d", "\u2018I got to talk to her, and she\u2019s not a bad person. It might take time, but try to improve your relationship.\u2019", "Seol Jihu swallowed the above words back down. He felt like saying so would be similar to how he almost forced Phi Sora to apologize.", "There was nothing more sensitive than personal relationships, so Seol Jihu decided to back down for now. Rather than stirring the problem, letting it resolve itself seemed to be the best choice. Perhaps, the two of them would work something out.", "After organizing his thoughts, Seol Jihu said good night and turned around.", "Yi Seol-Ah didn\u2019t leave right away. She stood still and heaved out the breath she had been holding in before smacking her lips and walking down.", "When she went back to her room, Yi Sungjin was waiting without sleeping.", "\u201cWhat did you talk about with Hyung?\u201d", "\u201cNothing, just the expedition and such.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah replied like it wasn\u2019t a big deal, then lied down on her bed.", "\u201cWe can\u2019t go on the expedition, huh.\u201d", "\u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t know anything about the place, so it\u2019s too dangerous. He said we could go with him on the next expedition.\u201d", "Yi Sungjin nodded his head helplessly.", "\u201cWhew, we better get stronger fast. We\u2019re only mooching off of him right now.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah pouted.", "\u201cHe also said that Carpe Diem will be with that Unni for a while. He said he hasn\u2019t decided yet, but it looks like he\u2019ll recruit her.\u201d", "Unexpectedly, Yi Sungjin wasn\u2019t surprised.", "\u201cI thought as much. I heard she performed well during the war.\u201d", "\u201cShe did? I still don\u2019t like it. Initially he was acting like he wasn\u2019t going to recruit her, and now\u2026\u201d", "Yi Sungjin flinched. Yi Seol-Ah rolled to the side and stared at him.", "\u201cYou agree, right?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Noona.\u201d", "Yi Sungjin\u2019s voice dropped a tone.", "Yi Seol-Ah stared at him with a \u2018why are you staring at me like that?\u2019 kind of look.", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t say that to Hyung, did you?\u201d", "\u201cHuh? What was that?\u201d", "\u201cWhat you just said. That you don\u2019t like it, and how he was acting like he wasn\u2019t going to recruit her.\u201d", "\u201cEi, of course not! Who do you think I am?\u201d", "She then asked with the look of an innocent child.", "\u201cBut why can\u2019t I? Gently, you know, and not nitpicking.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, no. You can\u2019t. Never.\u201d", "Yi Sungjin\u2019s firm reply made Yi Seol-Ah tilt her head.", "\u201cWhy? We\u2019re teammates.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re in different positions.

You know this too.\u201d", "\u201cI do. I don\u2019t like her either. But Hyung doesn\u2019t need to care about whether we like her or not.

She pulled her blanket all the way up to her head.", "\u201cI\u2019m just saying we should hurry up and get stronger. That way, we\u2019ll be able to protect our positions and gain the right to have a say.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah didn\u2019t answer.", "\u2018Did I go too far?\u2019 Yi Sungjin scratched his head.", "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep going like this forever. This is Paradise.\u201d", "With that, Yi Sungjin let out a long sigh and turned the lights off.", "\u201c\u2026I know that.\u201d", "Once darkness settled in, a quiet mutter escaped the blankets.", "*", "Next day.", "Seol Jihu left Carpe Diem\u2019s office around noon.", "It was to meet Maria.", "When he requested a visit at the reception desk, the female Priest at the counter revealed a reluctant face.
