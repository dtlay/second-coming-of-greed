He wiped his nose clean before he rummaged through the medicine bottles and took out a healing potion and a stamina recovery potion.", "He drank them down in one gulp. This was because they had the effect of recovering one\u2019s energy, although they weren\u2019t normally used this way.", "The village head would be sad if he found out that his prized potions were being used as mere tonics, but Seol Jihu had no other choice. After all, he might have really died if he didn\u2019t drink them. And starting from today, there was a new bottle to drink.", "Seol Jihu looked at the milky medicine bottle Jang Maldong gave him and grinned. From what he found out with the color of General Observation, this Competence had a four-times multiplicative effect for twelve hours.", "Although it paled in comparison to the VIP shop\u2019s Competence, it was still nothing to scoff at. After emptying the bottle in one gulp, Seol Jihu marched out of the cave commandingly.", "*", "After breakfast.", "For some reason, Jang Maldong ended the morning exercise early and dragged Seol Jihu to a large tree measuring more than two arms\u2019 width around.", "\u201cOriginally, I planned to make you continue that death-inducing run until the day we go back.\u201d", "Seol Jihu flinched hearing his serious tone. He didn\u2019t doubt Jang Maldong for even a second.", "\u201cBut it looks like you overcame a wall\u2026.\u201d", "It sounded like Jang Maldong knew his stamina broke through.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be too happy. People don\u2019t say stamina is the foundation to all strength for nothing. You\u2019re only getting started. Your freakishly high mana overshadows even some High Rankers, but your other stats are too low.\u201d", "He wasn\u2019t wrong. Even the difference between Low (High) and Intermediate (Low) couldn\u2019t be taken lightly, yet Seol Jihu\u2019s Mana stat was at Intermediate (High).", "It would make some sense if he were a Magician who refined mana to materialize spells, but as a Warrior who mainly used mana to amplify his physical abilities, this abnormality posed a problem.", "\u201cOf course, that also helps you to exhibit strength well beyond your level and physical abilities.\u201d", "\u201cRight, it does.\u201d Seol Jihu agreed right away. \u201cBut the way you said \u2018freakishly high\u2019 makes it sound like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d Jang Maldong chuckled and then crossed his arms. \u201cYour mana might flow through your Circuit, but it\u2019s your body that is influenced by the mana\u2019s amplifying effect. Once or twice might be okay, but in the long term, it will have a negative effect on your body.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean by negative effect\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cHmph, since you recklessly overwork your body all the time, you should have experienced it already\u2026.

Do any of these ring a bell?\u201d", "A sour look appeared on Seol Jihu\u2019s face, like he just bit into a bitter persimmon. The symptoms Jang Maldong described were everything he\u2019d felt whenever he used his mana to the limit.", "Seeing the young man\u2019s speechless face, Jang Maldong clicked his tongue.", "\u201cIf the body is a car, then mana is the engine.

Your engine is a time bomb.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s expression turned solemn.", "\u2018I see\u2026.

Get in there.\u201d", "Jang Maldong pointed his cane at a large old tree, which had dozens of logs hanging from it.

The moment he did, he had a strong hunch that he would be smacked with a cane.", "\u201cIt\u2019ll be better for you to experience it once than to hear it a hundred times. Perform the Thrust, Strike, and Cut.\u201d", "Rather than asking, \u2018Here?\u2019, Seol Jihu swallowed his saliva. The logs were definitely not hanging here as decorations. They were sure to come flying at him during the training. He could easily tell just from the way Jang Maldong grabbed one of the logs.", "\u201cStart.\u201d", "Swish! Swish! Seol Jihu began to perform the spear techniques. After about twenty reps, a log came flying toward his left flank. As he had been on guard expecting something like this to happen, Seol Jihu immediately tried to avoid it by stepping backward. However\u2026.", "Thwack!", "\u201cUuk!\u201d", "Before he could even take two steps, he felt a blunt impact on the back of his head. He wasn\u2019t hit. He actually ran into it himself.", "\u201cWho told you to move?\u201d", "Seol Jihu rubbed his head and groaned at Jang Maldong\u2019s commanding tone.", "\u201cYou can use your five senses or rely on your sixth sense.

He was used to performing the three spear techniques in one spot, but having to pay attention to the logs added a whole new level of confusion.", "Tk, tk, tk, tk! In the end, he was smacked in four different spots before falling. Clutching his head, he rolled around in pain.", "\u201cNice going.\u201d", "\u201cCome on, how am I supposed to dodge them if I\u2019m not looking?\u201d", "\u201cI never told you to dodge without looking. I told you to not look back.\u201d", "Jang Maldong continued calmly.", "\u201cI also told you not to move from that spot. But I never told you not to move at all.\u201d", "\u2018Wordplay?\u2019", "When Seol Jihu stared at him with blinking eyes, Jang Maldong closed his eyes gently. He was boiling with anger on the inside, but he opened his mouth with a calm expression.", "\u201cListen, brat. Stop trying to do things without a plan and use your head. Think about why you\u2019re investing your time into this training after drinking a precious Competence.\u201d", "He sighed and pointed the cane at him again.", "\u201cYou\u2019re quite proficient with the Thrust, Strike, and Cut. As long as you get in the right form, you display a high level of spearmanship. But the problem is this \u2014 no matter the reason, if your form gets shaken up even a little bit, your level plummets. It no longer stays as spearmanship but devolves into a random waving. Do you know why?\u201d", "Shake, shake.", "\u201cThat\u2019s because you have no experience.

Jang Maldong wasn\u2019t wrong. It wasn\u2019t like he could ask his opponent in the middle of a fierce battle, \u2018I\u2019m trying to do a proper attack, so can you wait a moment? If possible, take a few steps back too.\u2019", "\u201cI might be helping you train, but you\u2019re the one who is going to make something of it! If you find out what my intentions are in making you do this training and even pull off some level of success, then you\u2019ll end up with a great weapon in your hands.\u201d", "\u201cA great\u2026 weapon?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 it will provide a foundation to correct your twisted mind, technique, and body.\u201d", "Jang Maldong wasn\u2019t the type of person to say things in vain.

What, you don\u2019t want to train?\u201d", "\u201cFive minutes, no, three minutes! Just give me three minutes. Let me think about something.\u201d", "Jang Maldong revealed a look of discontent, but he didn\u2019t say no. That was because he could tell Seol Jihu\u2019s attitude had changed.", "After reflecting on everything Jang Maldong said, Seol Jihu opened his mouth, \u201cSir, I have a question.\u201d", "\u201cGo ahead.\u201d", "\u201cI know what the five senses are, but what do you mean by sixth sense?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201d", "Jang Maldong dropped his head a little and a thin smile spread across his face.", "\u2018Good!\u2019", "The young man wasn\u2019t a genius who could understand ten things if he was taught one. But since he was at least trying to understand more than one, how could Jang Maldong not be happy?", "\u201cI\u2019ll give you an example. Have you ever felt like someone was looking at you? Even once.\u201d", "Seol Jihu went, \u201cAh!\u201d There were indeed times like that. Was it in high school? When he was enjoying talking with his close female classmates, he often felt a stinging glare. And once he turned around, sensing that something was off, he would always see Yoo Seonhwa looking at him restlessly. He still didn\u2019t know why. After all, they weren\u2019t even going out at the time.", "\u201cLooks like you have. The ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning\u2014 that\u2019s what I call the sixth sense.\u201d", "\u201cAnd this sixth sense\u2026 it\u2019s something that can be trained?\u201d", "\u201cIf the reaction of your brain or your instincts are what\u2019s causing it, then why not? In the end, it\u2019s still a physical phenomenon.\u201d", "Seol Jihu exclaimed in awe inwardly. He finally understood why Jang Maldong made him drink the Competence. When he picked up his spear and got up, Jang Maldong also prepared himself.", "\u201cStart when you\u2019re ready.\u201d", "His signal also changed from \u2018start\u2019 to \u2018start when you\u2019re ready\u2019. These three additional words made a whole world of difference.", "Shortly afterward, Seol Jihu\u2019s spear began to stab and slice through the air. After another twenty reps\u2026.", "\u201c!\u201d", "A rope began to move. Seol Jihu didn\u2019t turn back to see where the log was coming from and only focused on the movement of the rope.", "Soon, when the rope that was moving like a pendulum drew a horizontal line, he slightly raised his leg.", "An abrasive surface brushed past his foot. That wasn\u2019t all. Tong! The sound of a log hitting something rang out.", "\u2018Left? No, is it a bit behind that?\u2019", "He wasn\u2019t sure. However, as soon as he heard the sound of something cutting through the air, he twisted his body. And as he spun, he stabbed forward with his spear.", "\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d", "He heard a compliment for the first time. But before he even had the chance to rejoice, a bloody smell spread out from the right side. He reflexively turned his head.", "\u201cGood.\u201d", "In the next instant, his neck felt itchy. Maintaining a high level of concentration, Seol Jihu followed his instincts and lowered his head.", "Swish. A sandpaper-like sensation brushed past his spine.", "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Jang Maldong clenched his fists. Like the saying, \u2018praise breeds willingness\u2019, Seol Jihu became more excited and heated up about the training.", "*", "Second week. The training entered a new phase.", "The content of the training changed quite a bit, but the biggest change was that Jang Maldong began to add detailed advice no matter what training Seol Jihu did.", "Even during weight training.", "\u201cThe body can\u2019t just be tough. It needs to be made durable so that it can absorb or ward off impact. If it can\u2019t be bent like steel, there\u2019s a chance it will shatter.\u201d He nagged about making the muscles more elastic.", "Of course, he did more than just physical training. When the morning training ended, Seol Jihu began his mana training under the guidance of Jang Maldong.", "\u201cFlash Step is a technique in which you move instantly by using the elasticity that comes from bending your body like a bow.\u201d", "The hellish muscle training ended, and Seol Jihu\u2019s ears perked up as he drank water while panting. He was expecting to begin Mana Spear training, but his interest was piqued after hearing the words \u2018Flash Step\u2019. After all, who wouldn\u2019t be excited about learning a new ability?", "\u201cSince it uses your entire body, you can say it\u2019s closer to a body technique than a foot technique.\u201d", "Jang Maldong pointed at a large tree in the distance. This one was a normal tree that didn\u2019t have any logs hanging off of it.", "\u201cYou see that, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cPrepare your Mana Spear.\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "He couldn\u2019t help but do a double-take. Jang Maldong immediately gave a more detailed explanation.", "\u201cUse your Mana Spear to make each leaf fall off. Remember, it\u2019s one leaf per spear. Make sure your Mana Spear doesn\u2019t affect the surroundings of the leaf.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2026 I would need to make the spear small and weak.\u201d", "\u201cYes, the key is to consume minimal energy to create Mana Spears. Try it. It won\u2019t be easy.\u201d", "\u201cIs there a point in doing that? The more mana I put in, the stronger Mana Spears\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s precisely the problem.\u201d Jang Maldong snorted.", "\u201cThere are three goals for this training. The first is to fix your bad habit.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cNo matter who or what you\u2019re fighting, you tend to pour your mana in. Like I said before, if you don\u2019t stop now, your body will break apart in the future.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThe second goal is a matter of efficiency. Since you always use all of your mana to defeat your target, you are unable to do delicate control. In other words, your control over mana is poor.\u201d", "Seol Jihu thought he was quite skilled at controlling his mana, so this came as a surprise. Although he nodded his head in agreement, he still had a few doubts.", "\u201cI understand what you mean, but what does this training have to do with Flash Step?\u201d", "He asked, figuring that the answer would be related to the third goal. However, Jang Maldong didn\u2019t answer outright.", "\u201cYou know\u2026,\u201d Jang Maldong stared at him and grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking this for a while now, but you really are the type who needs to be taught ten out of ten things.\u201d", "\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d Interpreting Jang Maldong\u2019s words as him needing to be spoonfed, he hurriedly apologized. Jang Maldong shook his head.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. You grew up on Earth, so it would be strange if you knew these things. Besides, it\u2019s not a bad thing to seek advice.\u201d", "He sighed disappointedly as he looked at Hugo, who was collapsed in the corner.", "\u201cDo you like soccer?\u201d", "It was a seemingly random question, and although Seol Jihu preferred baseball, he didn\u2019t say anything.", "\u201cIn terms of soccer\u2026 I\u2019m not expecting you to make goals. But if someone passes the ball to you, even if you miss your shot or the goalkeeper blocks it, it\u2019s normal to at least try to score.\u201d", "\u201cRight.\u201d", "\u201cSuppose that you just passed the ball to someone and he\u2019s just standing there in a daze. Wouldn\u2019t you be mad?\u201d", "\u201cI would.\u201d", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t exactly sure what was going on, but since Jang Maldong sounded like he was complaining, Seol Jihu just went along with it.", "\u201cRight?\u201d", "Whew- After taking a deep sigh, Jang Maldong smacked his lips.", "\u201cWell, in that sense\u2026 you\u2019re not half-bad. You\u2019re decisive as well.\u201d", "It sounded like he was complimenting him.", "\u201cBut sometimes, you need to learn to score by yourself.\u201d", "Jang Maldong put more strength into his voice.", "\u201cReceiving passes and scoring is a skill in itself, but there\u2019s no guarantee that someone will always pass the ball to you at the right time. Sometimes, it might even be impossible.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re saying I should develop a habit of thinking.\u201d", "\u201cYes. To be more precise, you have come to a realization on your own. If you can\u2019t do that, even if you become a High Ranker, you will only be a Halfie,\u201d Jang Maldong said solemnly before raising his cane.", "\u2018Halfie?\u2019", "Seol Jihu felt like he just heard an important piece of information. Although he had more questions to ask, he decided to focus on the training for now.", "Jang Maldong\u2019s cane was pointing to the tree.", "*", "A new training started, but that didn\u2019t mean his suffering decreased. In fact, if he was only talking about pain, it was multiplied several folds compared to before.", "He was bruised all over his body from being struck by the logs, his muscles spasmed, and because he focused on fine control of his mana, he felt drained of energy. Since he still had to run to finish the day, the quantity of training had actually increased.", "Jang Maldong really wasn\u2019t lying when he\u2019d said \u2018It will only get harder from tomorrow.\u2019", "\u201cUuuuu\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu groaned in pain as he headed to a lake near the cave. Even though all he wanted to do was just lie down when the training was over, he needed to wash up first. The cave was a small and confined space to begin with, and he would be causing the others a massive headache if he went in there smelling horrible.", "After great struggles, he finally arrived at the lake. He took his training clothes off and carefully dipped his body in the water. His skin stung for a moment, then his body trembled from the gentle flow of the water.", "It was so refreshing that he wanted to scream from the top of his lungs. But since he was exhausted, he chose to quietly swim along the lake currents. When he pushed his face underwater and loosened his arms and legs, he began to float with only his curved back above the surface.", "If anyone unfamiliar with the situation was watching him, they would surely think they were looking at a corpse. Of course, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t care about this in the slightest. His head was only filled with thoughts of training.", "The second week was coming to a close. He was making progress, but he was still clueless as to how the Flash Step worked.", "\u2018What does fine control of mana have to do with it?\u2019", "It was hard to believe that Jang Maldong said it without a purpose. Looking back at all the training exercises he\u2019d done, Jang Maldong\u2019s training seemed to be connected with each other.", "Rather than trying to achieve a single goal with a single training exercise, Jang Maldong\u2019s methods seemed to be arranged so that many things could be learned mid-process.", "In other words, it was likely that the two goals he heard about were clues to learning the Flash Step. It was just that\u2026 Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t figure it out.", "Seol Jihu slowly raised his head out of the water before taking a small breath and plunging his head back down. He got rid of all idle thoughts and entrusted his body to the flow.", "How much time went by? As he was endlessly floating on the lake\u2019s surface, feeling the flow of the water, Seol Jihu suddenly tilted his head.", "\u2018Flow?\u2019", "When this thought crossed his mind, an unknown sensation enveloped his body. He wasn\u2019t sure what to make of this sensation, but he subconsciously concentrated on the flow of the water brushing past his body.", "This was the first time he was experiencing such a phenomenon. He couldn\u2019t describe it well, but a regretful feeling swept over him. He felt like something was within his grasp but was escaping his hands every time.", "\u2018Flow, flow, flow, flow\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu muttered the word \u2018flow\u2019 over and over again as if to clutch at straws. That was when\u2026", "Tk. Something touched his head. At the same time, his concentration broke along with all the flowing sensation of the water.", "\u2018Ah!\u2019", "Seol Jihu raised his head wistfully. Immediately, something white filled his sight. Judging by its round figure, it seemed to be a rock. He must have hit his head while drifting around the lake.", "\u2018Damn it!\u2019", "Just when it was within my grasp\u2026.", "A look of annoyance spread across his face. Disturbed at a critical moment, he felt like he suffered a great injustice.", "\u2018This damned rock!\u2019", "Seol Jihu slammed his head against the rock. He knew what he was doing was stupid and knew that the rock wasn\u2019t at fault. Still, he planted his face on the rock repeatedly. Otherwise, he didn\u2019t feel like he could soothe his stomach.", "\u2018Damn it, damn it!\u2019", "And in the middle of busily slamming his head\u2026.", "\u2018Damn\u2026 it?\u2019", "He suddenly felt that something was off. His head should hurt given how hard he was slamming it into the rock, but he couldn\u2019t feel a thing. In fact, he felt like his brain was enjoying it.", "Looking at the rock again, he realized that it was too white to be a marble. It was as if he was looking at a ball of snow.", "\u2018What is it?\u2019", "When he rubbed his cheek against it, he felt its squishiness. The elasticity of the supposed rock was so soothing that he wanted to rub his face against it forever.", "\u2018There was a rock like this?\u2019", "Rather mystified, Seol Jihu dug his face into the soft surface. His face sunk right in. When he took a deep breath just to be sure, the fragrant smell of\u2026.", "\u2018Huh?\u2019", "At this point, Seol Jihu had an inkling as to what the rock was.", "Peek. He glanced to the side and saw another rock right there.", "\u2018Twin rocks?\u2019", "No, it was too smooth, round, and pretty to be a rock or a boulder. Seol Jihu slowly looked up. His gaze went past a slim porcelain-like waistline and climbed up the curve of a back with artistic beauty.", "When his gaze went above the neckline and confirmed the red lips clenching down, his eyes quivered.", "\u201cSo,\u201d A chilling voice just as icy as her cold gaze shot down. \u201cHow long do you plan on smelling my butt?\u201d", "Hiik-! Seol Jihu shot back in terror.", "Under the silent night sky, inside the lake gleaming with starlight, Agnes was covering her upper body with her arms, with her back pointed toward him. Her dazzling beauty made him wonder if he was looking at the goddess of beauty. Her hair wasn\u2019t tied up like usual, giving her a whole new look than what he was used to.", "\u2018No, wait.\u2019", "Admiring her beauty could wait. Seol Jihu snapped out of his daze and began to beg in a flustered gibberish. That it wasn\u2019t on purpose, that he was mistaken while thinking about something else\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d", "He was prepared to be beaten up until he was a step away from death when he heard this and couldn\u2019t believe his ears.", "\u2018D-Did I hear that correctly?\u2019", "\u201cYou see, I was a bit surprised too,\u201d Agnes muttered as she stealthily turned her sharp gaze.", "\u201cI had my guard down, but to think I wouldn\u2019t notice you approaching\u2026.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIf you approached with the intention of peeking, there\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t have noticed. At the very least, I believe that you were thinking about something else.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth opened slightly.", "\u201cSo,\u201d Agnes tried to raise her glasses out of habit, and then went back to covering her upper body when she realized she wasn\u2019t wearing them.", "\u201cWhat were you thinking about?\u201d She sounded like she wouldn\u2019t let him leave in one piece if she wasn\u2019t satisfied with his answer.", "\u201cY-You see\u2026 I was thinking about my new ability when the flow of water suddenly\u2026\u201d", "When Seol Jihu confessed everything he had experienced, Agnes\u2019s eyes widened and a fed-up expression surfaced on her face.", "Seol Jihu was washing up after a long tiring day of training. The fact that he was still thinking about training meant he had to be a masochist when it concerned training.", "\u201cI\u2019ve told you time and time again, resting is part of training. What you\u2019re doing is overworking your exhausted brain.\u201d", "\u201cRight, but what Master Jang said kept bothering me\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cMaster Jang? What did he say?\u201d", "\u201cSomething about being a Halfie High Ranker\u2026.\u201d", "Agnes went, \u201cAh\u201d, then made a dull smile. It was as if she was saying that he was worried for nothing.", "\u201cThat\u2019s Master Jang being stubborn.\u201d", "\u201cStubborn?\u201d", "\u201cYes, it\u2019s his personal philosophy. By his logic, 80% of all High Rankers would be Halfies.\u201d", "\u201cI see\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head, but he still couldn\u2019t hide his disappointment. Agnes\u2019s tongue licked her upper lip.", "\u201cAnyways, you said you were thinking about the flow of water\u2026? Perhaps that\u2019s a clue to arriving at the answer.\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked up. \u201cReally?\u201d", "\u201cI can tell you if you\u2019d like.\u201d", "\u201cReal\u2026 n-no.\u201d Seol Jihu\u2019s face brightened at Agnes\u2019s suggestion, but then he quickly waved his hand in refusal.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I want to do this by myself.\u201d", "Agnes nodded her head as if that was a fine choice.", "\u201cI understand. I wish you good luck.\u201d", "\u201cThank you. And, um, I\u2019m really sorry about before.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bowed from the waist. Agnes turned away.", "\u201cAnyways, you should stop floating around the lake just because the training isn\u2019t going well. You might drown if you accidentally fall asleep.\u201d With that, Agnes headed to the center of the lake with smooth movements.", "Seol Jihu was standing like a stone statue until now. Realizing that he was beginning to tremble, he quickly followed Agnes like a duckling chasing after its mother.", "He thought that the water was deep, but the ground was protruding up where Agnes was standing.", "\u2018So that\u2019s why\u2026.\u2019", "As he saw Agnes getting farther away, Seol Jihu rubbed his nose and cheeks. Then, he let out a small chuckle.", "To think the evil rock that interrupted his thoughts was Agnes\u2019s butt.", "\u2018Wait, then it\u2019s not an evil rock\u2026.\u2019", "He knew that he would be killed the moment he laughed, so he held his breath and reined in his laughter from bursting out.", "*", "The morning dawned.", "When Jang Maldong woke up in the morning, he became speechless at the sight in front of the cave. Four people were running together. Agnes, Kazuki, and even Hugo were there.", "That wasn\u2019t all. In terms of stamina, it was correct for Agnes to be in the lead, followed by Hugo, Kazuki, and Seol Jihu.", "However, Seol Jihu was running in the front, with Agnes chasing after him. They were running so fast that they were pouring with sweat.", "\u2018Brat\u2026.\u2019", "The young man could barely follow his training in the beginning, but now, he was even leading the group. Seeing him so passionate, the old man couldn\u2019t help but feel a little lump in his throat.", "He was proud. Compared to the two idiots who paid for a Ceremony to have him die, the young man was like a saint.", "Not long afterward, Kazuki and Hugo stopped. However, Seol Jihu was still running nonstop.", "It was truly an unbelievable sight.", "[I\u2019m not training so that I can run away.]", "He began to see the young man in a different light. He had no other choice but to re-evaluate his willpower.", "\u201cHaha!\u201d", "Jang Maldong laughed happily and watched Seol Jihu and Agnes climb up a hill to where he was. It was then\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201d", "He blinked in surprise as he saw the duo getting closer. Agnes seemed to be running at full speed but seemed to be unable to pass Seol Jihu. That was impossible from a logical standpoint.", "\u2018Wait a minute\u2026.\u2019", "Now that he thought about it, Seol Jihu was running abnormally fast. Soon, the young man climbed up the hill with a storm of dust behind him. As soon as he touched the starting point, he turned to the side.", "\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d He screamed and quickly made his way down the other side of the hill. His arms swung in quick succession, and his legs were barely visible.", "While Jang Maldong was looking at him in a daze, Agnes reached the starting point and quickly chased after him.", "\u201cStop right there!\u201d", "\u201cAt least give me an explanation!\u201d", "\u201cShut up! This is the third time\u2026!\u201d", "The incident began early morning while Jang Maldong was still asleep. Agnes got up at the same time as Seol Jihu and advised him to eat breakfast. They ended up eating together, but Seol Jihu remembered the previous night\u2019s incident and snickered.", "He thought he was being secretive, but there was no way someone of Agnes\u2019s caliber wouldn\u2019t have noticed.", "Seeing Seol Jihu dodge her gaze, she became convinced. She checked her Status Window just to be sure and erupted when she saw that \u2018Evil Butt\u2019 had been added.", "Seol Jihu ran away immediately.", "\u201cEvil Butt? What\u2019s so evil about my butt?\u201d", "\u201cI, I only thought about it in my head!\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll kill you once I get my hands on you!\u201d", "\u201cMiss Agnes!\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re dead!\u201d", "Agnes\u2019s voice echoed out far and wide.", "Meanwhile, Jang Maldong blankly watched the young man desperately running away with his Festina Earring in full use."]}
