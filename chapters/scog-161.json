A Call in the Middle of the Night", "content": ["It was unknown whether this change was influenced by Seol Jihu\u2019s decision, but his body came to accept the Essence of Soma as if it was family.", "The essence took root as an inner core in Seol Jihu\u2019s dantian, and once the fusing process fully elapsed, Seol Jihu\u2019s body became noticeably better.", "By dinnertime, Seol Jihu considered going back to training, but Seo Yuhui\u2019s vehement protest made him watch the Yi siblings instead.", "Watching them was fun in its own way.", "Yi Sungjin was doing nothing but toiling away extremely hard, and Phi Sora was surprisingly helping him train.", "That said, all she was doing was standing on a small hill, rolling down decently sized big boulders. She also made it clear that Jang Maldong was forcing her to do this, but the simple fact that she was helping was still an improvement.", "When a boulder skipped down the hill, Yi Sungjin would grit his teeth and use his body as a shield to crash against it.", "Jang Maldong\u2019s rebuke followed if he tripped even a little.", "On the other hand\u2026", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were a Tracker?\u201d", "\u201cYes, I am!\u201d", "\u201cThen I don\u2019t know why you are asking me. I am a Level 4 Archer, but I am heavily focused on offense. Tracking is not my specialty.\u201d", "\u201cI was hoping you could teach me just the basics\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m busy trying to regain my battle instincts. Don\u2019t bother me.\u201d", "When Marcel Ghionea turned back with a cold reply, Yi Seol-Ah shouted in a hurry.", "\u201cB-But! Orabeo-nim and Master Jang told me to study under you\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cLeader did?\u201d", "\u201cYes?\u201d", "\u201cShall we start then?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cTracking isn\u2019t my specialty, but I will teach you what I can. Generally, there are two types of Level 2 Archers \u2014 Rangers and Trackers. Since you\u2019re the latter, you should be walking on the path of Pathfinders. Now, I will teach you what it means to be a Pathfinder\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed after seeing Marcel Ghionea do a complete 180. Then, as the training was coming to an end, he volunteered to help cook.", "Although he already had dinner, he knew how hungry one would get after a difficult training.", "Seol Jihu had chosen ramen as the day\u2019s late-night meal.", "He had brought some with him, hoping to eat a bit when he missed it, but he did not get the chance due to Seo Yuhui\u2019s late-night meals.", "He became busy with setting fire, boiling water, putting in the noodles and soup powder, and cracking open eggs\u2026.", "Bubble, bubble.", "When the smell of ramen began to spread out, the people, who were resting on the ground or returning after bathing in the lake, gathered.", "Seol Jihu held up chopsticks and paper cups he\u2019d prepared beforehand.", "\u201cAnybody want some? I made enough to go around.\u201d", "\u201cRamen at this time of night? You should be resting.\u201d", "Jang Maldong grumbled.", "\u201cI, I want some.\u201d", "However, Seo Yuhui surprisingly raised her hand with sparkling eyes. She was even drooling.", "As this side of her was something everyone found difficult to even imagine, they stared at her curiously.", "But ignoring such stares, Seo Yuhui took a paper cup full of ramen and quickly took a mouthful.", "\u201cMmmmn!\u201d", "She clasped her hands together, hunched her shoulders, and shuddered.", "\u201cAh, really, this ramen! I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve waited!\u201d", "She shouted inadvertently before realizing the surrounding peculiar stares and chuckling awkwardly.", "\u201cIt, it\u2019s well made. I\u2019ve been wanting to eat ramen for a while\u2026.\u201d", "Murmuring in a diminishing voice, she quietly went back to eating ramen.", "\u201cOh, wow, so she\u2019s speaking casually now, huh.\u201d", "Phi Sora snorted before nudging Seol Jihu.", "\u201cI can have some too, right? I helped with the training today.\u201d", "\u201cGo ahead. I would have let you have some even if you didn\u2019t help with the training.\u201d", "\u201cThanks!\u201d", "When Seol Jihu handed Phi Sora a cup of ramen, she took it somewhat arrogantly. But it didn't take long until her \u2018let\u2019s see what it tastes like\u2019 expression made a complete turn.", "After a bite, her eyes widened, and after the second, she grew dubious.", "Next, she poured the entire cup into her mouth.", "\u201cHaa~\u201d", "Breathing out a hot breath, she reached toward the pot, which was still full of ramen. Her chopsticks clashed with Seo Yuhui\u2019s, who was also reaching out for more at the same time.", "Electricity flew in the air as the two women glared at each other.", "The corner of Phi Sora\u2019s mouth twisted up.", "\u201cUnni, didn\u2019t you finish a cup already?\u201d", "\u201cSame goes for you, Miss Phi Sora.\u201d", "\u201cI hope you can concede. I have to gain weight, you see. But you, Unni\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora glanced at Seo Yuhui from top to bottom, making her thoughts extremely clear. Seo Yuhui laughed in response.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Any fat I gain from eating all goes to my breasts.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Ah, I see.\u201d", "Clang, clang. Even as they talked, their chopsticks clashed nonstop. Just as Seol Jihu was wondering how two pairs of chopsticks could even make such a sound, Jang Maldong let out a dry cough.", "\u201cKuhum. What happened?\u201d", "\u201cPardon? Ah, we decided to be close, like an older sister and a younger brother.\u201d", "\u201cAh, well, I guess that\u2019s fine. Anyways, I\u2019ll try a cup too.\u201d", "It seemed that was his real intention. Seol Jihu smiled and handed Jang Maldong a cup.", "Soon, with the sound of slurping noodles, Jang Maldong\u2019s eyes widened and he burst into laughter.", "\u201cHaha! You little bastard! Why don\u2019t you open up a ramen shop?\u201d", "\u201cIs it good?\u201d", "\u201cIt slides down my throat like magic.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah took a cup and hopped in with a comment.", "An unexpected ramen party broke out.", "On this silent night\u2026", "\u201cJihu, Noona wants more ramen\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll make more right away.\u201d", "Under the quiet night sky\u2026", "\u201cAh, hurry up! I\u2019m hungry!\u201d", "\u201cAlright, alright, just wait a bit more.\u201d", "\u201cEii, I don\u2019t usually eat ramen. Why is this so good? Did you put in drugs or something?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t kid.\u201d", "A group was gathered around a crackling campfire\u2026", "\u201cMiss Phi Sora is right. This noodle is chewy and full of flavor, and even the soup is incredible\u2026. Orabeo-nim, how did you make this ramen?\u201d", "\u201cI just follow the instructions on the back.\u201d", "\u201cEi, don\u2019t be like that. Tell me the secret.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m being serious. Who knows more about ramen than the person who created it? Just follow the instructions.\u201d", "Everyone laughed and talked while sharing a pot of ramen. Seeing how much everyone was enjoying the ramen he cooked, Seol Jihu was overwhelmed with happiness.", "This minor incident, in which eating ramen made everyone happy, touched Seol Jihu. If he could, he would not hesitate to stop time and hold onto this moment forever.", "\u2018I hope every day will be like this moment.\u2019", "How nice would it be if he could enjoy every passing day without having to worry about anything?", "Of course, he knew that he couldn\u2019t stay in Huge Stone Rocky Mountain forever\u2026 but Seol Jihu hoped this time would last a little longer.", "\u2018Anyways, should I really start a ramen shop in the future?\u2019", "Seeing how popular his ramen was even in Paradise, Seol Jihu made a mental note to look into a vacant shop when he returned to Haramark as he laid down on his sleeping bag.", "Soon, Seol Jihu breathed periodically and fell asleep. The smile on his face made him look extremely happy, and he really did feel that way on the inside.", "Until dawn arrived.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s sweet sleep came to an end when someone shook him awake. Seo Yuhui, who also looked half-asleep, was shaking him urgently.", "\u201cJihu. Jihu.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Noona?\u201d", "\u201cWake up. Hurry!\u201d", "As soon as Seol Jihu crawled out of his sleeping bag, Seo Yuhui handed him several crystals, which were all flickering with incoming calls.", "Seol Jihu had brought a total of four communication crystals, each connected to Kim Hannah, Sicilia, the Haramark Royal Palace, and Carpe Diem, respectively.", "The problem was that all four of these crystals were blinking.", "This was the first time that all four groups were trying to contact him simultaneously.", "\u2018What happened?\u2019", "He wasn\u2019t sure, but it did not seem like a simple matter.", "He was roused awake in an instant.", "After a moment of hesitation, Seol Jihu infused his mana into each crystal. Then, the communication crystals turned on.", "\u2014Seol!", "Starting with Teresa\u2026", "\u2014You\u2019re finally awake.", "Agnes\u2026", "\u2014You up?", "Chohong\u2026", "\u2014Hey! You\u2026?", "And even Kim Hannah.", "Kim Hannah looked around and, upon seeing three other communication crystals, made a dumbfounded face.", "\u2014You goddamn idiot\u2026!", "Pat. Kim Hannah\u2019s crystal flickered off. The other three women looked at each other in confusion before Teresa finally spoke up.", "\u2014Miss Agnes, Miss Chung Chohong, I will tell him the news.", "\u2014Understood.", "\u2014\u2026Okay.", "Pat. Pat. Agnes and Chohong\u2019s crystals flickered off.", "Now, only one communication crystal remained. Teresa tried her best to sound calm, but a faintly trembling voice escaped her mouth.", "\u2014Where are you right now?", "\u201cI\u2019m at Huge Stone Rocky Mountain.\u201d", "\u2014That\u2019s\u2026 Ah.", "\u201cWe had new recruits. I also went to train under Master Jang. Um\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows in the middle of talking. Wiiiing\u2014 It was because he could faintly hear the sound of a siren.", "\u2014I see. I thought you\u2026 right, there\u2019s no way you would.", "\u2018No way I would what?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head and asked.", "\u201cWhat happened, Princess?\u201d", "\u2014Seol, listen to me carefully.", "Teresa who sounded relieved suddenly turned serious. Seol Jihu realized the gravity of the situation and listened in while suppressing his nervousness.", "Soon, Seol Jihu\u2019s face contorted, and he exclaimed in shock.", "\u201cW-What?!\u201d", "\u2014It\u2019s not just us. All royal families other than Scheherazade issued a draft-call.", "\u201cBut why so suddenly\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shut his mouth and nibbled on his lip.", "\u201cUnderstood. We will return as soon as possible. No, we\u2019ll be there today.\u201d", "\u2014\u2026Thank you.", "The call ended.", "Seol Jihu and Seo Yuhui stared at each other for a moment before beginning to wake everyone up one by one.", "\u201cWhat is it\u2026?\u201d", "Jang Maldong, who was sleep talking with a drowsy face, shot up as soon as he heard the news.", "\u201cW-What?! The Parasites have gathered an army?!\u201d", "His hoarse voice was roused awake and let out a startled yelp.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just Haramark. Apparently, they are encroaching upon the entire human territory from all sides.\u201d", "\u201cHa, so they finally did it\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong stared at Seo Yuhui and asked.", "\u201cWhat about the Federation?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re not sure. All we heard is that we should return as soon as possible. We\u2019ll have to wait to find out the details.\u201d", "\u201cThe training is over. Pack your bags and contact Chohong.\u201d", "\u201cGot it.\u201d", "The situation suddenly turned urgent. The silent cave grew loud in the blink of an eye.", "By the time everyone finished packing, Flone returned to the cave after having been gone for a while. Like a ghost, she had returned when she sensed that the group was about to leave.", "\u2018Wait, she is a ghost.\u2019", "Flone looked strangely wistful after hearing the explanation.", "[That\u2019s unfortunate. I wanted to go explore with you.]", "\u201cExplore?\u201d", "[You have this pendant.]", "The pendant on Seol Jihu\u2019s neck shook.", "[Grandpa told me about its secret.]", "\u2018Secret?\u2019", "[Do you remember when I told you about how Grandpa hid the family\u2019s wealth before going to the greedy emperor\u2019s villa?]", "\u201cI do.\u201d", "[Don\u2019t be surprised. He said this pendant has the coordinates for the location of the hidden wealth!]", "This pendant contained the coordinates for the hidden wealth of the Rothschear family, which was famous for being rich even in the era of the Empire?", "Although it was an enticing piece of info, now wasn\u2019t the time to think about it.", "Now that the Parasites had raised an army, a mere exploration or an expedition was a trivial matter.", "\u201cSorry, now isn\u2019t a good time.\u201d", "[No, it\u2019s fine. You said those undead bastards are invading?]", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "[Then we can go after we kill all of them, right?]", "Seeing Flone twist her neck and wrist, Seol Jihu laughed.", "He inwardly thanked Flone for making him laugh.", "Then, he suddenly had a feeling that this couldn\u2019t be the only secret behind the pendant. While he was racking his brain trying to connect the dots, a communication crystal flickered on.", "\u201cChohong!\u201d", "She was there just a moment ago, so he had been worried when she wasn\u2019t picking up.", "\u2014Yeah. It\u2019s about a carriage, right?", "\u201cDid you send one?\u201d", "\u2014I went to the stables to look into it, but returned because it didn\u2019t look like I had to.", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u2014Never mind that. You know the place the carriage always drops you off at the foot of Huge Stone Rocky Mountain, right? Go there in the morning and wait.", "Seol Jihu understood what Chohong meant when morning arrived.", "Just to be safe, the group had been waiting at the usual place from dawn. When the sun rose, a carriage had arrived.", "The one who got off from the carriage was Hugo.", "\u201cI\u2019ve come to meet, no save, my future wife.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI hesitated a little\u2026 but Hell is only a little scary if it is for my first future wife\u2026. Huh? Why is everyone here?\u201d", "Hugo, who blabbered with air, asked when he saw everyone with their bags packed. From the looks of it, it seemed like he didn\u2019t know what happened.", "He must have left Haramark before the news broke.", "Thinking \u2018nice timing\u2019, Seol Jihu made a deal with the carriage coachman before hopping on the carriage with Seo Yuhui.", "Jang Maldong tapped the frozen Hugo\u2019s shoulders as he brushed by.", "\u201cEven a dog\u2019s turd can be used for medicine\u2026. Good job.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d", "Soon, the sound of someone causing a ruckus outside rang out. The uproar didn\u2019t last long as Hugo must have heard what happened, but he had no choice but to return to Haramark as soon as he arrived at Huge Stone Rocky Mountain.", "With a face that was neither crying nor laughing.", "The coachman whipped his rein.", "Dudududu, dudududu!", "As Seol Jihu had given him an extra silver coin to go as fast as possible, the horses ran as though their lives were on the line.", "The inside of the carriage was dead silent. Jang Maldong, who was fiddling with his wooden cane, broke the silence.", "\u201cI have a bad feeling about this one\u2026.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah, who was already unable to sit comfortably, tightened her grip on her younger brother\u2019s hand with a nervous face.", "\u201cThe Parasites\u2019 invasions so far had all been ambushes. But this time\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong blurred the end of his speech, but Seol Jihu could guess what came next without having to hear it.", "An invasion of such a massive scale was like a bolt of lightning from a clear sky, but Seol Jihu tried his best to maintain his composure and looked at the air.", "[Your Status Window]", "[3.

It was the equivalent of consuming five Divine Elixirs or of using 10 Ability Points.", "Purely in terms of physical level, he was comparable or even above most High Rankers.", "That wasn\u2019t all.", "When he roused his mana, golden energy began to coalesce in his hand.", "The crackling golden energy looked supremely beautiful and powerful.", "Things were completely different than when he was Level 1 and left for Arden Valley without knowing anything.", "His stats were incomparably better, he had obtained the evil-hunting power, and most importantly, he had gained several reliable allies.", "\u2018I have to win.\u2019", "No.", "\u2018I will win.\u2019", "Looking at his golden mana, Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes flickered with determination."]}
