Attribute Change, and...", "content": ["Undying Diligence led the Nosferatu, and Vulgar Chastity and Unsightly Humility were also Army Commanders who led their own Parasite armies.", "Other than the Queen whom they served, the seven Army Commanders were the Parasites\u2019 highest-ranked beings.", "But the Parasite Queen was dispatching three of them just to assault a single valley? Even going so far as deploying ten precious Nests?", "Considering the fact that two of the Seven Armies had left the Material Realm for unavoidable reasons, the Parasite Queen was deploying more than half of the Parasites\u2019 available forces.", "Being wasteful was generally not a problem. As it was the Queen\u2019s strict command, if they had excess troops or leisure, Undying Diligence would have followed the order without a word of complaint.", "The problem was that they had just conquered Tigol Fortress.", "[If we advance towards Haramark, they will surely come out to Arden Valley.]", "Hearing the Parasite Queen\u2019s command, Undying Diligence became conflicted.", "The battle at Tigol Fortress was a large-scale siege battle fully utilizing the five remaining Parasite armies, and the Parasites had just barely conquered the fortress after a fierce battle. Naturally, this spoke volumes of how important Tigol Fortress was as a strategic point.", "It would be a different story if the Parasites had completely taken over the fortress, but with the Federation gritting their teeth to try to reclaim the fortress, if the Parasites reassigned over half of their forces, there was a high chance that the Federation would succeed in their recapture efforts.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "As such, Undying Diligence strongly wanted to protest.

Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to let Chohong and Hugo know through the communication crystal.", "Marcel Ghionea was someone who was far from being sociable.", "Although he treated Seol Jihu and Jang Maldong with respect, he consistently treated the Yi siblings coldly, even though they were making efforts to warm up to him.", "Rather than doing so on purpose, it was more correct that this was how he normally was. After all, he was cold even to Chohong, whom he was acquainted with.", "But seeing as how Chohong didn\u2019t get angry, he didn\u2019t seem to be missing a screw like a certain someone. So, Seol Jihu welcomed him with open arms.", "He could see a somewhat bitter Phi Sora watching them from the corner of the cave, but she vacated the area.", "Just to be sure, Seol Jihu asked Marcel Ghionea whether he would like to return to Carpe Diem\u2019s office and rest, but he made a surprising request instead.", "\u201cI would like to join the training.\u201d", "\u201cTraining?\u201d", "\u201cYes. I have heard about Master Jang\u2019s reputation to the point of having my ears bleed.

Marcel Ghionea was the one who asked him to do so.", "\u201cIf it is about my body, I have already fully recovered. But because I\u2019ve been held captive for too long, I seem to have lost my touch\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cHaving one more person won\u2019t pose much of a problem\u2026. Fine. We will work on slowly re-sharpening your senses while making sure your injuries are not worsened.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Jang Maldong was being rather considerate, but Marcel Ghionea flat out refused him.", "\u201cI have heard about your training methods, Sir. Please work me to your heart\u2019s content. That will be much more beneficial.\u201d", "Hearing this unbelievable request, the Yi siblings became dazed. They looked like they had just seen a madman while walking down the streets.", "\u201cHoh\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong couldn\u2019t hide his astonishment.", "\u201cTo think I would hear this from someone other than that boy\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong struck his palm with his cane and let out a sinister \u2018Keuhuhu.\u2019", "\u201cFine.

Seol Jihu\u2019s Status Window was changing by the day.", "\u2018Something\u2019s weird.\u2019", "His physical stats had increased evenly, including his Luck stat, and only his Mana stat remained the same.", "Of course, this was something Seol Jihu should welcome with open arms\u2026 but there were more than a few suspicious points.", "Should he say that things were progressing too smoothly?", "After carefully contemplating for a few days, his suspicions turned into convictions. The more he trained, the more the energy inside of him would digest and increase his physical level.", "Moreover, even though it felt like he\u2019d already drained a lot of this mysterious energy, he still felt an inestimable amount left in his body.", "At this point, Seol Jihu could no longer believe that the recent changes were only the fruits of his labor.", "\u2018The late-night meals.\u2019", "Thinking about it now, the sudden changes began after he started having late-night meals with Seo Yuhui. No matter how many times he thought about the matter, that was the only suspicious point.", "Then, a new question arose in his mind.", "If Seo Yuhui really was the source of all this change, why was she treating him so well?", "He had heard about the Daughter of Luxuria caring for talented Earthlings and helping them grow, but this was simply too much.", "She was no longer just helping, but almost being a charity like the Giving Tree.", "\u2018Why?\u2019", "Clutching his hand and pondering, Seol Jihu slowly looked around. He couldn\u2019t see Seo Yuhui anywhere.", "Now that he thought about it, Seo Yuhui had been acting a bit differently recently.", "Not only did her late-night meals become less frequent, but she also wasn\u2019t wandering around Huge Stone Rocky Mountain and was often staring at the sky with eyes full of worry.", "And whenever Seol Jihu asked if she was worried about something, she would only shake her head with a pensive smile.", "\u2018My curiosity would be satiated if only I could see her Status Window with General Observation.\u2019", "Why did the Nine Eyes not work on Seo Yuhui and Cinzia? The dejected Seol Jihu suddenly heard approaching footsteps and turned around.", "It was Shuttle, no, Phi Sora.", "She stopped and went straight to the point.", "\u201cGrandpa is calling you. Your lover is with him too.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s not my lover.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, yeah. Anyways, judging by their faces, it looks like it\u2019s something important.

The leader of that group of war hawks?\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. I know she is a Magician, but that\u2019s about it. But why are you asking me this?\u201d", "Hearing Phi Sora\u2019s question, Seol Jihu scratched the back of his neck.", "\u201cAh\u2026 I was just curious about the difference between High Rankers and Unique Rankers.

For example, Gula would be gluttony. You will suddenly have the urge to eat whenever you see food or things like that. The urge is faint when you\u2019re a High Ranker, so it\u2019s not too bad. For the record, I serve Ira, the Goddess of Rage.\u201d", "Seol Jihu barely held himself back from blurting out, \u2018Is that why your personality is so fiery?\u2019", "\u201cBut from what I hear, this urge becomes far more intense when you become a Unique Ranker and go through the specialization process under your god\u2019s power. It hear it becomes an unbearable desire.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. He understood what Phi Sora was saying, but he had immediately thought of a counterexample.", "\u201cBut Lady Seo Yuhui is\u2014\u201d", "\u201cA Unique Ranker who serves the Goddess of Lust. That\u2019s what makes her so amazing.\u201d", "Phi Sora replied immediately and shrugged her shoulders.", "\u201cWho knows whether she\u2019s holding it in with superhuman patience? You never know what someone is feeling on the inside.\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026 then what about Executors?\u201d", "Hearing this, Phi Sora raised her hand to her stomach in the shape of a blade, then quickly raised it.", "\u201cYou can think of Executors as being a stage higher than Unique Rankers.\u201d", "\u201cSo their desires will be even stronger?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d", "Phi Sora raised her index finger.", "\u201cBecoming an Executor means becoming an apostle chosen by a god. You break away from your human shell and become your god\u2019s avatar.\u201d", "\u201cAvatar?\u201d", "\u201cNot only are you bestowed power, but you also come to share values, personality, thoughts, and life with your god. It\u2019s obvious why you will be influenced so much.\u201d", "\u201cAt that point\u2026 aren\u2019t you just the god\u2019s puppet?\u201d", "\u201cNo, not at all. The god cannot force you in any way, and your will is prioritized above all. There is a reason why Executors are called that \u2014 because they carry out the will of their gods. Well, some call them Avatars or Clones, which makes sense as well\u2026. Ah, my throat hurts.\u201d", "Seol Jihu had asked, wondering whether the reason he could not see Seo Yuhui\u2019s Status Window was because she was an Executor, but he ended up getting more information than he had expected.", "\u201cBy the way, don\u2019t you have to go?\u201d", "Phi Sora asked while rubbing her neck.", "\u201cI don\u2019t mind, but they\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "Only then did Seol Jihu start racing to the cave.", "Just as Phi Sora said, Jang Maldong and Seo Yuhui were waiting inside the cave.

You should remember me telling you about the attribute change.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head.", "\u201cBut you said it\u2019s not something that can be learned quickly\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cRight. You have to learn Mana Cultivation and then slowly take in lightning energy to transform your mana. But, a good opportunity just came up.\u201d", "When Jang Maldong looked to his side, Seo Yuhui slowly reached her hand out.", "Next, when she reached into the empty air and pulled something out, Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be so shocked. It\u2019s Dimensional Pocket, one of the innate Authorities of a Unique Ranker.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was surprised to see something he had only read about in novels, but that surprise only lasted a moment as his attention was taken by the object Seo Yuhui took out.", "It was a beautiful red flower shaped like a marigold.", "Its round, fanned-out petals were encapsulating a small, circular crystal that shone like a firefly.", "\u201cIt\u2019s called the Essence of Soma. Pretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head in a daze. He was just thinking how pretty it would look as an earring or a ring.", "Then, he suddenly closed his mouth and blinked.", "Why was she showing him this thing called the Essence of Soma?", "Jang Maldong opened his mouth.", "\u201cThe Essence of Soma is\u2026 simply put, something like an inner core.\u201d", "\u201cAn inner core?\u201d", "\u201cYep. As long as you can absorb it, your mana will come to carry powerful lightning energy. In other words, you\u2019ll be able to skip the process of gathering lightning energy with Mana Cultivation.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped. He was saying that it was basically a cheat key that could skip the long and boring grinding?", "\u201cAnd another thing.\u201d", "Jang Maldong continued.", "\u201cIf you acquire this essence, you will gain another powerful weapon.\u201d", "\u201cPower weapon\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cThe anti-evil attribute.\u201d", "With a short reply, Jang Maldong raised his tone by a notch.", "\u201cSo (\u71d2) meaning to incinerate and Ma (\u9b54) meaning evil. Soma. It\u2019s an attribute that incinerates evil. Considering the fact that most of the Parasites\u2019 forces are undead creatures\u2026 you can see how useful this attribute will be.\u201d", "Seol Jihu swallowed hard.", "He wanted it. And judging from how things were going, it looked like Seo Yuhui was planning of gifting it to him. But\u2026", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it incredibly precious?\u201d", "\u201cIs that even a question?\u201d", "Jang Maldong snorted.", "\u201cIts value doesn\u2019t just come from its rarity. Attribute change stops at just resisting evil, but Soma is a power that was created to combat evil.

Seeing this legendary sacred flower has shocked me too much\u2026. Please, it\u2019s all yours.\u201d", "Jang Maldong left the cave. With only Seo Yuhui and Seol Jihu in the cave, a somewhat awkward air flowed between them.", "Seol Jihu, whose eyes were fixated on the Flower of Soma, faced Seo Yuhui and asked seriously.", "\u201cHow much does it cost?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s a bit difficult to put a price tag on it.\u201d", "The slightly troubled Seo Yuhui suddenly put on a courteous smile.", "\u201cIf it is okay, may I ask for something other than money?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. I have more items than money.\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied quickly, having no intention of losing out on this opportunity, and Seo Yuhui shook her head gently.", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about items\u2026. I\u2019d like you to grant me a request.\u201d", "\u201cRequest?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui gently grasped the flower and smiled.", "\u201cCan we be a bit more close with each other?\u201d", "For a moment, the nervous Seol Jihu doubted his ears.", "He was thinking about agreeing to any request as long as he didn\u2019t need to step into the Parasites\u2019 territory, but he became dumbfounded by the unexpected nature of her request.", "\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 your request?\u201d", "He asked again just to be sure\u2026", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "But the answer was the same.", "In that instant, the questions he had forgotten about popped up in his head once again, and he snapped out of his daze as though he had been doused in cold water.", "Seol Jihu stared at Seo Yuhui fixedly. Her smile was just as kind and comforting as before.", "If he threw a tantrum and pestered her to give him the Essence of Soma, he felt she really would give it to him.", "\u2018\u2026Why?\u2019", "His flames of suspicion had been lit and refused to flicker off. As a result, her bright smile looked different than usual.", "It was as if he was leery of her, but he felt slightly uncomfortable.", "\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth moved\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Strange.\u201d", "And he finally spat out these two words.", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s smiling eyes quickly widened to a circle.
