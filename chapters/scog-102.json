Judging by its mild intensity, it wasn\u2019t anything worth worrying about.

I heard he was a Level 2! Why is he so strong?\u201d", "\u201cJust tell him to go easier then. Think about your age. I know more than a few people who left this world trying to act like they were still in their prime.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d", "Thwack! His cane cleanly struck Chohong\u2019s head, and she immediately wrapped her hands around it and screamed.", "\u201cAh, why\u2019d you hit me!? I was just worried about you!\u201d", "\u201cWorried? That\u2019s the tone of someone who\u2019s worried? You were ready to make offerings to send me off!\u201d", "\u201cOh please, making offerings? I already tried that and it was useless!\u201d", "Hearing Chohong\u2019s confession, the old man scowled.", "\u201cRight, now that I think about it, that did happen.\u201d", "It was a story from a long time ago. Tired of suffering from the old man\u2019s Spartan training method, Chohong and Hugo gritted their teeth and scrounged up some money. Not knowing what they were really up to, the old man proudly went, \u201cHoho, you two stopped going to bar? You must have finally sobered up.\u201d", "He even tried to buy them better equipment and went with them to an armor shop, but to his surprise, neither Chohong nor Hugo had a penny to their name. He tried to find out what happened, and it turned out that they went to the Temple of Luxuria and offered everything to a Priest to have a Ceremony done.", "It wasn\u2019t long until he found out that they begged for something to happen to the old man. Right, they had actually made offerings to wish him death.", "\u201cYou treacherous fools. I was wondering why flower pots kept falling on my head and why I kept tripping. It was all you idiots\u2019 fault.\u201d", "When the old man growled, Chohong snickered.", "\u201cNo, no, we were tricked too! That dumbass Maria lied with a straight face and said she was a Chief Priest.\u201d", "\u201cIs that something to be proud of!? Are you bragging!? Huh!?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding. Isn\u2019t that obvious? Geez, your high and mighty attitude hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, huh.\u201d", "Thwack! Thwack! Quick tapping sounds rang out. Chohong moaned \u201cAuuuu!\u201d before falling forward and rubbing her head against the couch.", "\u201cCome on, think of how desperate we were! Wouldn\u2019t you do the same if you were being beaten day and night!?\u201d", "\u201cYou idiot! If you were half as smart and earnest as Dylan, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to work you so hard!

The old man pointing his wooden cane at her also collected his breath and sat back down. While Chohong was panting, he gently opened his mouth.", "\u201cI heard what happened. Looks like you\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You should have visited earlier. Do you have any idea how much Dylan wanted to see you?\u201d", "Chohong retorted in a softer voice.", "\u201cHmph, you and your mannerless way of talking.\u201d", "The old man replied curtly, then let out a sigh. The aged wrinkles on his face made him look like he lost weight.", "\u201cBut well done. It sounds like the Parasites came up with a frightening plan, but not only did you save Dylan, you even managed to stop them. You performed outstandingly.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t do much. If anything, it\u2019s that guy who should be praised. He\u2019s the one who did everything.\u201d", "\u201cThat guy?\u201d", "\u201cSeol. You know, Seol, the guy you were training before. Speaking of which, what was up with that? I thought you retired.\u201d", "The old man didn\u2019t hear what happened in detail, so hearing that the young man \u2018did everything\u2019 came as a surprise.", "\u201cWell\u2026 he pleaded desperately and I found it hard to say no. But I couldn\u2019t bear to just watch him, so I figured I\u2019d do it as a pastime until you guys were back.\u201d", "\u201cOh? Is this really the old man who\u2019s twisted to his bone marrow? The past you would have turned back without even considering\u2026. Ah! What, I can\u2019t even say what\u2019s on my mind!?\u201d", "When the old man raised his wooden cane, Chohong backed off with a terrified face. The old man clicked his tongue and looked up at the ceiling.", "\u201cWhat a hassle. I left in peace knowing I could entrust Carpe Diem to Dylan, but now that he\u2019s gone, it\u2019ll only be a matter of time until Carpe Diem disbands.\u201d", "His worries were justified since the leader and nucleus of the team had died. Chohong pouted.", "\u201cDon\u2019t ignore us. I\u2019m a High Ranker now, too.\u201d", "The old man looked as if he just received a culture shock.", "\u201cW-What? Someone like you, a\u2026 High Ranker!?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m a Templar now.\u201d", "When Chohong strutted her chest proudly, the old man asked again.", "\u201cReally? How?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m a Warrior. I amassed more than enough experience points while I was stuck at Level 4, and as for Enlightenment\u2026.\u201d", "When Chohong hesitated to talk about this \u2018Enlightenment\u2019, the old man said tactfully.", "\u201cEnlightenment isn\u2019t necessary. Plus, weren\u2019t you trying to pass expediently using your technical starting class as a Priest? Rather than that, what about the mission from the royal family?\u201d", "\u201cHow is Manifestation an expedient method? It\u2019s my Class Ability.\u201d", "Chohong protested and continued as if she had just suffered a wrong.", "\u201cAs for the mission from the royal family, they wrote it off since I participated in the rescue mission. I risked my life for that mission, so they wouldn\u2019t send me off on another one unless they\u2019re the worst sons of bitches.\u201d", "To become a High Ranker, an Earthling had to pass the formality of completing a mission issued by any of the royal families. One thing of note was that this mission was always related to the Parasites. Since it boasted a terrifying level of difficulty, there were countless Earthlings who were unhappy with it.", "But that couldn\u2019t be helped. After all, just by becoming a Level 5, one would gain both the status and the authority needed to spread their voice in Paradise.", "In the first place, the reason the royal families intervened in the Earthlings\u2019 High Rank promotions was to \u2018prevent giving authority and power to those who did not contribute for the betterment of Paradise\u2019. The seven gods agreed with the seven kingdoms as well.", "Ever since this change happened, the number of new High Rankers decreased dramatically. This was because more and more Earthlings chose to stay at Level 4, realizing the risk needed to overcome the wall blocking their path.", "In a way, it was quite a depressing reality. It was well-known how powerful High Rankers truly were. For the royal families who detested the Parasites to put such a restriction on their own allies, it could be seen just how deplorable the Earthlings were.", "\u201cI see, that makes sense.\u201d", "The old man agreed readily.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad. Since you\u2019re now a High Ranker, you have the qualifications to take on the mantle of the leader.\u201d", "\u201cEh? Me? Leader? No thanks, I can\u2019t do something like that. I don\u2019t want to either.\u201d", "Chohong waved her hand with a scowl. Being a leader of a team wasn\u2019t something anyone could do. Not only did you need power, but you also needed the brain to make sound judgments in critical moments.", "Dylan was an ideal leader from this perspective, but Chohong was an idiot who only knew how to fight. This was something the old man knew as well.", "\u201cRight\u2026. If you wanted to become a leader, you would have chosen to become a Crusader, not a Templar.\u201d", "The old man said regrettably.", "\u201cAnyways, I\u2019m never going to become the leader. I know my personality. If I become the leader, this team is done for.\u201d", "The old man nodded his head in complete agreement but still spoke with sincerity.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no other choice. A High Ranker needs to be the leader for a team to have any face. Besides, you\u2019re at least better than Hugo.\u201d", "\u201cFuck. You\u2019re right about that, but why does that make me angry?\u201d", "Seeing Chohong\u2019s annoyed expression, the old man shook his head side to side.", "\u201cWhat else can we do? It\u2019s not like we can entrust the position of the leader to that Level 2 newbie.\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s complexion sank. Just like the old man said, this problem couldn\u2019t be avoided much longer. Setting aside the emptiness left behind by Dylan\u2019s death, Carpe Diem needed to elect a new leader to elevate the team\u2019s dispirited atmosphere.", "Right, she knew this\u2026 but there was just one problem.", "\u2018There\u2019s no one suitable for the job.\u2019", "Chohong knew her place. Hugo was also out of the question. She saw some potential in Seol, but he was still too inexperienced.", "\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201d", "Chohong stole a glance at the old man and smacked her lips. She got up while scratching her neck harshly.", "\u201cI\u2019ll consider it. It\u2019s not something I should decide alone anyways.\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThe three of us will take care of it, so don\u2019t mind it. You\u2019re already retired, so it shouldn\u2019t concern you. Don\u2019t be a nagging mother-in-law, okay?\u201d", "The old man chuckled. Chohong was curt, but he wasn\u2019t so dull as to not notice her true feelings.", "\u201cColor me surprised.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cWho would have thought that an immature brat like you could learn to be so considerate? Looks like you\u2019ve tasted Paradise\u2019s waters a bit.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m a High Ranker, you know.\u201d", "\u201cHmph, but you\u2019re still a Halfie. Don\u2019t be too full of yourself.\u201d", "Seeing the old man instantly switch from praising to rebuking, Chohong dropped her head and sighed.", "\u201cAnyways, don\u2019t concern yourself with this problem any further, old man. Just meet everyone you came to meet and go back. Don\u2019t go sticking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d", "\u201cOf course. So, when\u2019s Hugo getting here?\u201d", "\u201cIt should be soon. Aren\u2019t there other people you have to see?\u201d", "\u201cJust Hugo\u2019s enough.\u201d", "Hearing this, Chohong smacked her chest uncomfortably.", "\u201cGeez, clean up after yourself before you leave. Do you know what we had to go through after you left? Everyone we met asked, \u2018When is the old man coming back?\u2019 or \u2018Did he really retire?\u2019\u201d", "\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d", "The old man smiled bitterly as he waved his cane around.", "*", "Hugo came back to Paradise five days later, and during this time, many people visited Carpe Diem\u2019s office. Without even the slightest bit of exaggeration, almost everyone Seol Jihu met since he came to Haramark came to visit.", "\u201cMaldong! My old friend!\u201d", "Starting with someone he never met before\u2026.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Old Boy.\u201d", "Cinzia and Agnes came.", "\u201cI hope you\u2019ve been well, Sir Jang Maldong.\u201d", "Kazuki dropped by.", "\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to see you, Master Jang.\u201d", "Even Haramark\u2019s king, Prihi Hussey, came to visit. As he witnessed the old man\u2019s terrifying connections for the past five days, he learned a thing or two about this man named \u2018Jang Maldong\u2019.", "The first was that he was also from Area 1. The second was that he was incredibly famous even though he wasn\u2019t a Magician. Finally, he seemed to be the founder of Carpe Diem.", "Of course, that wasn\u2019t all.", "\u201cNo more worries! It\u2019s the start of happy days!\u201d", "Hugo spread his arms out and cheered as he ran. He had been smiling nonstop ever since he returned and found Jang Maldong in the office.", "\u201cUhuhuhu, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we return to being Haramark\u2019s number one team!\u201d", "Seeing how confident he was, Seol Jihu approached him like a fish who bit the bait.", "\u201cHe must be someone incredible.\u201d", "\u201cYes! Incredible doesn\u2019t begin to describe him!\u201d", "\u201cCould he be a Unique Ranker? Or perhaps, an Executor?\u201d", "Hugo\u2019s bobbing head stopped.", "\u201cUhh\u2026 no. He\u2019s a High Ranker.\u201d", "Seol Jihu doubted his ears. He certainly wasn\u2019t looking down on Level 5 Earthlings, but he couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.", "\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate him just because of his level. Old Man Maldong\u2019s worth can\u2019t be evaluated with Paradise\u2019s system.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu asked with glittering eyes, Hugo\u2019s lips pursed before he made a troubled expression. It seemed his tiny brain was having trouble coming up with the words to explain the old man. Though quite a bit of time went by, he managed to pull through.", "\u201cRemember how there are four classes when you first begin? Archer, Magician, Priest, and Warrior.\u201d", "\u201cYes, and no exceptions.\u201d", "\u201cBut! That doesn\u2019t mean you have to walk the path of combat.\u201d", "Seol Jihu mulled over Hugo\u2019s words before opening his mouth.", "\u201cNow that I think about it, I heard there were people who focused on production.\u201d", "\u201cExactly! But production classes aren\u2019t the only non-combat classes.\u201d", "\u201cThen what?\u201d", "Hugo became speechless once again. He wrapped his hands around his head, then suddenly yelled, \u201cAh!\u201d", "\u201cMiss Foxy!!\u201d", "\u201cKim Hannah!!\u201d", "Seol Jihu also shouted, feeling like he had to play along with Hugo.", "\u201cYes! The person who you\u2019re contracted to!\u201d", "Hugo spoke excitedly as if he finally thought of a good example.", "\u201cShe\u2019s the same. She started out as an Archer, but she became a High Ranker some other way.\u201d", "What did that mean?", "\u201cKim Hannah was an Archer?\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d", "Hugo must have thought Seol Jihu would know this as a look of surprise appeared on his face.", "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m hearing about it. What exactly is that other way?\u201d", "Hugo became silent. Rather than being unable to say his thoughts, he seemed to be choosing his words carefully.", "\u201cMm\u2026. To put it in a good way, her abilities are excellent.\u201d", "\u201cAnd if you put it in a bad way?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d", "\u201cI-If you say so\u2026.\u201d", "Hugo made Seol Jihu promise three times before he finally said it.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a con artist.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was about to ask why, but he remembered the early parts of his dream and shut his mouth. Hugo let out a dry cough before continuing with his words.", "\u201cComing back to my point, I think everyone has some sort of talent. But that doesn\u2019t mean that their talent has to be battle-oriented.\u201d", "\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that if you\u2019re skilled at lying or cheating, the gods will develop your talent and guide you in that direction?\u201d", "\u201cExactly. Kim Hannah might be one of the most famous brokers in Paradise, but Old Man Jang is indisputably the best trainer in Paradise. The Daughter of Luxuria is famous in her own right, but she doesn\u2019t hold a candle to our old man.\u201d", "Hugo gave a thumbs up. Suddenly, Seol Jihu remembered the old man yelling at him.", "[You absolute fool! You have such a powerful engine, so why aren\u2019t you using it properly!? What a waste of mana!]", "Just thinking about it sent shivers down his spine. As someone who had received Jang Maldong\u2019s mana training, he couldn\u2019t help but agree with Hugo one hundred percent.", "In truth, Seol Jihu had only spent five days training with Jang Maldong. But during these five days, not only was he able to evolve his Spear Throw skill, but he was also able to learn a new ability.", "What was even more frightening was that he awakened this new ability while training to evolve \u2018Spear Throw\u2019 to \u2018Mana Spear\u2019. Since he even got to raise the proficiency of Mana Circulation, it was no wonder he was so shocked.", "\u2018All I did was follow his instructions\u2026.\u2019", "Having experienced Jang Maldong\u2019s magic personally, Seol Jihu fully agreed with Hugo\u2019s assessment.", "\u201cThat\u2019s not all. He has incredible eyes for discerning the talent and nature of people.\u201d", "\u201cOh yeah?\u201d", "\u201cJust wait a few days. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find us a skilled Archer. He might even train one up himself.\u201d", "Hugo laughed cheerfully before going \u201cAh!\u201d and clapping his hands.", "\u201cHey! This is a good opportunity. Why don\u2019t you ask the old man to train you too?\u201d", "That was what Seol Jihu wanted too. If he got this far by training under him for five days, how strong would he get if he trained under him for a long time?", "Just thinking about it made him excited.", "\u201cWell, to be honest, the training is going to be su~~per hard. You might want to kill yourself even. But if you endure his hellish training\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThen what?\u201d", "Seol Jihu swallowed hard, his eyes sparkling. Hugo opened his mouth with a serious face.", "It was then.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "A firm voice cut between the two men. They turned around simultaneously.", "\u201cHugo, don\u2019t tell him useless things and get him excited for nothing.\u201d", "Chohong was doing sit-ups on a workout machine but got up to glare at Hugo.", "\u201cWhat do you mean, useless?\u201d", "Hugo retorted coldly, seemingly bothered by Chohong raining on his parade.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d", "\u201cHey, all I\u2019m saying is that-\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know about Seol, but you\u2019re not qualified to ask him for help, just like me and Dylan.\u201d", "Hearing her blunt statement, Hugo flinched and shrunk back.", "\u201cHe barely managed to retire after leaving behind his lingering attachments.

Promise.\u201d", "But Chohong gave him her unique, chilly glare, and Hugo froze up on the spot.", "\u201cDo you want to see him be disappointed again?\u201d", "Her sharp voice caused Hugo to grimace. He gritted his teeth and glared back at Chohong before growling like a tiger and leaving. The heated mood flushed cold in an instant.", "Caught between a rock and a hard place, Seol Jihu stealthily walked toward Chohong who snorted and went back to working out.", "\u201cI told you no, okay?\u201d", "But before he could even ask, Chohong warned him. Feeling a bit guilty, he pouted his lower lip.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious what you were trying to\u2026 say!\u201d", "Chohong raised her upper body with a grunt. After watching her toned abs for a moment, he raised his finger and poked her belly button.", "\u201cAh, that tickles! Stop, are you a pervert?\u201d", "\u201cChohong-.\u201d", "\u201cYou can act cute all you want, but I won\u2019t change my mind.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s shoulders dropped. There was no hesitation in Chohong\u2019s voice. It was clear she already made up her mind.", "\u201cBut why not?\u201d", "She didn\u2019t answer immediately. She simply continued working out in silence. Soon, she stepped down from the workout machine and put a towel over her shoulder. She didn\u2019t open her mouth until she turned halfway back to grab her water bottle.", "\u201cOld Man Maldong\u2026 he\u2019s the oldest Earthling in Paradise. Not necessarily by age, but by how long he\u2019s been here.\u201d", "\u201cHow long?\u201d", "\u201cEven I\u2019m not sure.\u201d", "Chohong muttered as she twisted the water bottle open.", "\u201cBut I do know he\u2019s been here longer than anybody else I know. I think he\u2019s one of the first people to have entered Paradise.\u201d", "\u201cOh?\u201d", "\u201cSurprising, right? You see, working in Paradise for over 10 years isn\u2019t easy\u2026.\u201d", "Gulp, gulp. Puha! She emptied half of the bottle in one shot before continuing.", "\u201cUnless you\u2019re attached to this world in some way, it\u2019s impossible to last that long.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head.", "\u201cReally, no matter how much I think about it, he\u2019s one hell of an old man. He entered Paradise at his old age and scraped up his talent as a trainer to aid Paradise. Who could hate him? If it were up to me, I\u2019d give him a long, standing ovation.\u201d", "But after that, Chohong blurred her speech.", "\u201cBut you know\u2026 not everyone is as noble and amazing as Old Man Maldong\u2026.\u201d", "She sounded like she was prompting him to agree. But rather than nodding his head or verbally agreeing, he chose to ask a question.", "\u201cWhat did you mean when you were talking about him being disappointed?\u201d", "Chohong paused.
