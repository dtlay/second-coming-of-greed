What is it?\u201d", "\u201cAlso, I have a couple of favors I\u2019d like to ask you.\u201d", "Prihi stared at Seol Jihu, who suddenly turned serious. What was the young man trying to say?", "\u201cI\u2019ll listen to the favors first.\u201d", "\u201cCan you prepare a new habitable land in Haramark using this gold bar?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Land?\u201d", "Prihi\u2019s tone went up, and his usually-calm eyes narrowed slightly. It was as if he heard something completely unexpected.", "Seol Jihu continued without a pause.", "\u201cIn addition, please lend me Master Ian.\u201d", "\u201cIan Denzel?\u201d", "Prihi\u2019s eyes clearly narrowed to a slit, his expression forming a frown. Ian Denzel was a Magician affiliated with the royal family and one of the few Earthlings Prihi trusted. There was no need to even mention the value of a Magician. He might understand if the young man gave a good reason, but he didn\u2019t feel good being told to \u2018lend him\u2019 out of the blue.", "\u201cFather.\u201d", "When Teresa tried to step in, Prihi raised his hand to stop her.", "\u201cIs this related to what you wanted to tell me?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Prihi gave the young man a deeply profound look. Seeing this gaze that seemed to be asking for an explanation, Seol Jihu opened his mouth. He told him about the village head of Ramman Village and the ghost saintess trapped in the Forest of Denial\u2019s tomb. As the story continued, the king\u2019s indifferent expression changed to one of interest.", "\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d", "Prihi leaned forward, locked his fingers, and rested his chin on them.", "\u201cYou want us to accept the villagers into the city.\u201d", "\u201cI heard that the castle has limited capacity, but I\u2019d like to ask you if it is at all possible.\u201d", "\u201cHm, to be frank, it is quite difficult. The castle is already at max capacity. A couple dozen might be acceptable, but accepting hundreds of villagers is a bit\u2026.\u201d", "Prihi sounded reluctant. Helping a large group migrate wasn\u2019t an easy task. If he simply allowed them into the city and forgot about them, they would only become homeless and displaced. If that were to happen, it was better to not accept them in the first place. Thus, granting Seol Jihu\u2019s request meant he would have to prepare them shelter as well as means of living.", "\u201cYour Majesty, you said that the royal family is fair in rewards and punishments. One is a retired old man living in seclusion and the other is a soul, but I believe they have the right to be rewarded more than anyone else who participated in this mission.\u201d", "Seeing the king in thought, Seol Jihu pleaded earnestly.", "\u201c\u2026It is true that Ramman Village is in an awkward location. I won\u2019t deny that I thought it couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201d", "Prihi let out a deep sigh and nodded his head.", "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a matter I can decide on easily. But with this gold bar, I can examine it favorably.\u201d", "\u201cThen!\u201d", "Just as the young man rejoiced\u2026.", "\u201cBut, why?\u201d", "Prihi\u2019s eyes suddenly flashed.", "\u201cI want you to hear me out without misunderstanding me. Are you not an Earthling?\u201d", "\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d", "\u201cI am not trying to discuss philosophy, nor am I trying to discuss right and wrong. It is just that\u2026 you are an Earthling.\u201d", "Prihi emphasized the last line.", "\u201cSetting aside the matter of the Forest of Denial, is there a need to do so much for Ramman Village?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you understood me, but I will be frank. The villagers will be ecstatic and grateful if you simply send them a supply of food. You will also have repaid your debt to the village head.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t that Seol Jihu hadn\u2019t thought of this. A part of him wanted to put on airs and take the gold bar for himself.", "\u201cIf it is weighing on your conscience, I shall tell you this. The current Haramark cannot afford to look after its people. I can easily decline your request of kindness given the circumstances we face.\u201d", "He was right. Pleading with the king only to be turned down because it was difficult. What better excuse was there?", "\u201cIn other words, no one will criticize you for taking this gold.\u201d", "He was right again. Who would criticize him? All he had to do was keep his mouth shut. Moreover, he would become rich as long as he took this gold.", "\u201cYou want to use this gold for a cause which will not benefit you. I can\u2019t help but be curious about your ulterior motive.\u201d", "Right, it wasn\u2019t that he was selfless. However, to him, there was something even more important than the gold in front of him. If he didn\u2019t look at the gold bar with his Nine Eyes, he wouldn\u2019t have noticed it until the end. But he had seen it and come to a conclusion.", "\u201cThere is nothing I\u2019d call an ulterior motive.\u201d", "He could now say this without hesitation.", "\u201cI am only acting according to my rule.\u201d", "\u201cRule?\u201d", "\u201cIf you owe a debt, it is only natural to pay it back. An opportunity to do so has landed right in front of me. What reason do I have to not take it?\u201d", "Prihi looked dumbfounded.", "\u201cI do not understand you at all. You don\u2019t seem to be the type who likes to play with words.\u201d", "Seol Jihu almost answered, \u2018I do, actually\u2019, but he managed to stop himself from ruining the tension. He got to the main point.", "\u201cI call it the Golden Commandment.\u201d", "\u201cGolden Commandment?\u201d", "\u201cThe ghost saintess and the village head. Both of them treated me well. I cannot shamelessly pretend the achievements were mine alone, and it is improper for me to compromise with myself when I am treating others. After all, doing so would be deceiving my benefactors. I would rather not treat them unless I do it to my fullest power.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cYour Majesty, if I cannot pay my debts to those two, I cannot expect them to treat me the same again. That is what I fear the most.\u201d", "When the young man looked up at the king after a long monologue, he saw the king blinking his eyes repeatedly. He looked as if he had taken a blow to his face.", "\u201cYou cannot expect them to treat you the same again\u2026.\u201d", "A few minutes went by before the king decided to open his mouth again.", "\u201cIndeed.\u201d", "He leaned back on his chair and said as he massaged his nose.", "\u201cI am beginning to understand you better. Humans all have a limit to their vessel. The same goes for ghosts.\u201d", "\u2018A limit to their vessel\u2026.\u2019", "For some reason, that line touched him. He felt like it was the perfect summary of the Golden Commandment.", "\u201cThank you for your understanding.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t give a clear answer yet, so I want to ask you one final question.\u201d", "Prihi asked in a soft voice.", "\u201cIs this truly what you want?\u201d", "\u201cYes!\u201d", "Seol Jihu answered without hesitation. Rather than being uncomfortable, spending the gold this way made him feel a thousand times better. Seeing the bright smile on the young man\u2019s face, Prihi made his decision.", "\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d", "So this is why you wanted me to meet him so much. He murmured to himself quietly so that Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t hear him.", "\u201cThen fine.\u201d", "Finally, the decision was announced.", "\u201cI, Prihi Hussey, hereby permit all villagers of Ramman Village to settle in the city. The gold bar rewarded to Seol Jihu shall be used to support them both materially and spiritually.\u201d", "A royal decree. Although his position no longer possessed the glory it once held, the weight it carried made it such that his decisions could not be flipped lightly.", "\u201cFurthermore, we shall partially support the appeasing of the pitiful soul trapped inside the Forest of Denial\u2019s tomb.\u201d", "Partially support? What did that mean?", "\u201cHe means he will raise the level and quality of the Ceremony.\u201d", "Teresa whispered in his ear.", "\u201cHer status does not disappear just because she became a soul. Although it was hundreds of years ago, didn\u2019t you say she was canonized by the Empire? I mean to show her the appropriate level of respect.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped at Prihi\u2019s statement. He had been expecting a simple rite where she was offered food and someone to talk to.", "When he imagined how much the saintess would rejoice, a smile bloomed on his face. And seeing this satisfied smile, Prihi rested his chin on his hands.", "\u201cAnd?\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cWe can finish discussing official work here. Why don\u2019t we continue what we were talking about before? Something small, if possible.\u201d", "Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t an idiot. He realized what the king was implying right away. Although he put a restriction of it having to be small, he was saying he wouldn\u2019t allow the young man to return empty-handed.", "\u201cUh\u2026 well\u2026.\u201d", "The king waited patiently, but Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know what to say. This truly meant that the young man did not want anything other than what he requested before.", "\u201cYou can take your time. The night is long.\u201d", "After saying so with benevolence\u2026.", "\u201cI will have to get going. I\u2019m not the type of person who likes to procrastinate. It will take a few days for us to come up with a solid plan.\u201d", "He picked up the gold bar and got up.", "\u201cFather, you\u2019re leaving? You should stay a little longer.\u201d", "Teresa muttered as if she was asking how he could leave a pair of healthy man and woman alone at night. Prihi looked dumbfounded.", "\u201cHoho, I have quite the vixen as my daughter. Don\u2019t say something you don\u2019t mean a tiny bit. The one who told me to look for an opportunity to leave was\u2026.\u201d", "He was mumbling with a wry chuckle\u2026.", "\u201cI came up with the perfect excuse to leave you two alone. How can you be so blind?\u201d", "Crack, crack- But he changed tune as soon as he heard the sound the bones cracking. Teresa, who was cracking her neck and knuckles, smiled brightly.", "\u201cOh, this young lady misunderstood her father\u2019s intention. Please leave this to me and focus on state affairs.\u201d", "\u201cMy\u2026. It\u2019s like I am entrusting a fish to a thieving cat.\u201d", "\u201cDid you say something?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m going to risk my well-being and just say this. You can enter the storage, but don\u2019t touch anything from the royal treasury.\u201d", "\u201cGeez, don\u2019t be such a worrywart. Besides, it\u2019s not like the royal treasury deserves to be called that.\u201d", "Teresa grumbled, and Prihi smiled bitterly.", "\u201cI\u2019m just telling you not to empty out the way of living. I know that a married daughter is no better than a stranger, but have some self-restraint. When your older sister got married, she\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cEii, who do you think I am? I\u2019m not like Older Sis. I\u2019ll leave the furniture and tableware at least.\u201d", "While saying that, Teresa stealthily avoided Prihi\u2019s gaze. By now, even a fool would realize what they were talking about, yet Seol Jihu was staring at them blankly with an innocent face.", "Prihi clicked his tongue.", "\u201cReally, both in this world and that world, heroes are quite the peculiar group of people. Maybe it isn\u2019t a matter of genes, but some sort of outside interference.\u201d", "He mumbled regrettably before saying his farewell.", "\u201cThat was an interesting story and an enjoyable meeting. It was a time well spent. I\u2019ll take my leave so you can enjoy at ease.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know what he meant by enjoying at ease, but he quickly got up as well. However, Prihi placed his hand on his shoulder as if such motion was unnecessary and spoke.", "\u201cAlso.\u201d", "His clear eyes stared at the young man, and a gentle smile spread across his face. It was the first smile he was showing since their meeting. Teresa\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cThank you for saving my daughter.\u201d", "At that moment, the sense of incongruity Seol Jihu had been subtly feeling disappeared instantly. Should he say the distance between them had shortened drastically?", "\u201cI\u2019m humbl-\u201d", "\u201cAh, please.\u201d", "\u201cN-No problem.\u201d", "With a chuckle, Prihi tapped on his shoulders twice before leaving.", "\u201c\u2026Well that was a surprise.\u201d", "Teresa also chuckled, seemingly caught off guard by her father.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen Father laugh.\u201d", "\u201cDoes His Majesty not laugh often?\u201d", "\u201cRather than that, he\u2026.\u201d", "Teresa was about to say something but swallowed her words back down. She felt like it was something she didn\u2019t need to mention.", "\u201cAnyways, why don\u2019t we go somewhere cozy and finish talking about your reward?\u201d", "\u201cOh, are we going to the storage?\u201d", "\u201cAii, geez, don\u2019t be in such a rush. Let\u2019s chat while we slowly eat some dessert. We have lots of time.\u201d", "\u2018Dessert!\u2019", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t have any reasons to refuse. He was nervous and full of tension while he was eating, so he could barely taste the food. Now that the talk had gone well and he was left with someone he was more comfortable around, his taste buds returned and were roaring to eat. He gulped.", "\u201cI\u2019d love to try it.\u201d", "\u201cYou can look forward to it. Once you taste it once, you\u2019ll never be able to forget it.\u201d", "After announcing this confidently, Teresa got up.", "\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go!\u201d", "\u201cWhere?\u201d", "\u201cMy bedroom.\u201d", "\u201cHuh? We\u2019re not eating it here?\u201d", "It was a justified question given that they were in the dining room. Teresa giggled.", "\u201cThis dessert has to be eaten in a secluded place. Though, eating it where you can be found out would give it a special flavor as well.\u201d", "The young man tilted his head. Teresa made an alluring smile and wagged the bait seductively.", "\u201cCome on, get up. Hurry! Not anyone can eat this dessert, you know!\u201d", "\u201cWow, it must be really precious.\u201d", "Teresa looked as if that was obvious.", "\u201cOf course, it is. Father and Mother only made one in the world.\u201d", "The king and the queen personally made it?", "\u201cWhat is it called?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s no fun if I tell you beforehand.\u201d", "\u201cEii, come on, tell me.\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked again, wondering how eating a dessert could be fun in the first place.", "\u201cHn~ng.\u201d", "Teresa licked her lips before staring at him coyly. Then, she exclaimed.", "\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d", "*", "Seol Jihu refused vehemently, but when Teresa threatened to not give the reward, he bit the bullet and followed her to her bedroom. Thankfully, the dessert was a true delicacy. It was soft and flavorful, making him devour it eagerly, forgetting about saving face.", "He enjoyed eating Teresa Hussey, and because the Princess got happy seeing him eat so tastily, he was able to return with all sorts of additional rewards she gave.", "\u2018Who would have thought there was a dessert like that?\u2019", "There really was a dessert called \u2018Teresa Hussey\u2019. It was a cute, no, a refreshing strawberry-flavored pink cake. Apparently, the king and the queen had personally made it for their youngest daughter, who was a helpless sweet-tooth. The cake was then given Teresa\u2019s name as it was created on her birthday.", "\u2018That was great.\u2019", "He wanted to taste it again. Enjoying the cake\u2019s sweetness still lingering in his mouth, Seol Jihu returned to the office.", "\u2018It\u2019s a good thing I went.\u2019", "He felt like today was his lucky day. Not only was did he pay back the debt he owed the village head, but he was also able to care for the ghost saintess.", "That wasn\u2019t all. Looking at the rewards he put on the office table, a feeling of satisfaction spread across his face. Although he didn\u2019t get to enter the nominal royal treasury, the items he received made him wonder if it was okay.", "First was a metallic mace called \u2018+2 Thorn of Steel\u2019. Crafted by refining a meteorite, it boasted hardness that was ten times that of ordinary steel, and it was enchanted with magic that doubled its attack power when it successfully hit its target.", "\u2018Chohong should love it.\u2019", "He got it as a gift for Chohong, who was likely to become a High Ranker soon. He could only imagine how giddy she would be.", "He also received a crucifix artifact. Although it wasn\u2019t as good as the Proof of Chastity, it was still an item that money couldn\u2019t buy. He was certain it would be an excellent bait to lure out Maria when he needed her.", "When he was about to leave the palace\u2019s storage room, thinking just these two were enough, Teresa told him to wait before bringing him a black belt. The belt was enchanted with a permanent \u2018Pocket\u2019 magic, allowing it to store two bags\u2019 worth of items.", "The one thing that bothered him was how she carefully looked around the area while telling him to hide it on his way out. When he asked if he could really take it, Teresa immediately exclaimed that she didn\u2019t steal it from the royal treasury. As Seol Jihu trusted her wholeheartedly, he took it at ease.", "Finally, she handed him 500 silver coins, saying it was a \u2018small expression of gratitude\u2019.", "\u201cAh~\u201d", "While he was happily looking at the items, he suddenly remembered the bracelet the ghost saintess gave him. He immediately took it out from his pocket.", "\u2018I wonder what effect it has.\u2019", "Since it was an item from the Empire, it was unlikely to be simple. Seol Jihu activated the Nine Eyes\u2019 color of General Observation and gazed at the golden bracelet.", "Soon\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201d", "His smiling eyes opened wide."]}
