No matter the era, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for the ruling party to designate some places as forbidden grounds.", "It was just that this Sacrificium place had been designated as a place one couldn\u2019t visit easily by an emperor of the Empire, a nation which was said to have reached the apex of magic engineering. The weight of the ban was far heavier than normal.", "\u201cWhy did he designate it as a forbidden place?\u201d", "[Uuuuun~]", "Flone groaned, seemingly having trouble recalling something that happened such a long time ago.", "[I think it\u2019s because people kept dying even after the death of the previous emperor.]", "\u2018After the death of the previous emperor?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cWas he raising a monster in his villa or something?\u201d", "[I don\u2019t know.]", "The smoke shook side to side.", "[Many people wondered what the exact reason was, but no one could figure it out. The only thing everyone knew was that the only person to survive after going into that villa was that greedy emperor himself. Both during his lifetime and after.]", "\u201cDo you think you could explain this in greater detail?\u201d", "At that moment, a small cough rang out, causing Seol Jihu to jump in surprise. Jang Maldong was staring at him with narrowed eyes.", "\u201cAre you calling someone?\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Ah, yes.\u201d", "\u201cYou can talk normally. You don\u2019t have to whisper.\u201d", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "Jang Maldong closed his eyes again after giving Seol Jihu a fixed stare.", "Seol Jihu had many questions he wanted to ask Flone\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "But because it felt like Jang Maldong noticed something, he couldn\u2019t open his mouth easily.", "*", "When Seol Jihu returned to Haramark, he saw that Kim Hannah was calling him. He immediately placed his hand on the round crystal, and they were connected in less than 10 seconds.", "The reason she had called was to notify him that she had found the Heaven-Slaughtering Star and the white headband girl.", "The brother and sister duo were last seen in Eva. But seeing as how they disappeared after going into the temple, she said they had likely gone back to Earth and that she would notify him when they returned. It was at this moment that she realized Seol Jihu wasn\u2019t really listening and furrowed her brows.", "\u2014What\u2019s up with that attitude? You\u2019re the one who asked me for help.", "\u201cOh yeah, thanks.\u201d", "\u2014Do I have to fish for compliments? What\u2019s wrong? Is something worrying you?", "\u2018Should I say it?\u2019 Seol Jihu hesitated. Although he wanted to confide in someone, Bok Jungsik had asked not to let the Yi siblings know about the transfer, and had even asked for a non-disclosure request.", "But because Seol Jihu wanted to obtain information, he asked in a roundabout way so as to keep the secret.", "However, Kim Hannah wasn\u2019t someone to be looked down on.", "\u2014Archer? You mean, Yi Seol-Ah?", "She instantly realized what he was worried about when he said, \u2018Master visited White Rose because they had a talented Archer.\u2019", "\u201cNo?\u201d", "\u2014Don\u2019t lie. Ordinary Archers won\u2019t catch Master Jang\u2019s eye. Since you said White Rose\u2026 it either has to be their top Archer or a rising star.", "\u201cWell, he actually went to see their top Archer.\u201d", "\u2014Oh yeah? What was that Archer\u2019s name?", "\u201cUh, what was it again?\u201d", "\u2014Funny. You\u2019re saying that without even batting an eye? Hey, don\u2019t lie to me. That top Archer I just mentioned? He recently ended his contract with White Rose and left.", "When Seol Jihu fell silent, Kim Hannah laughed as if his attempt to trick her was cute.", "\u2014Who are you trying to fool? Wet your mouth a little before you try.", "Seol Jihu looked dumbstruck. Kim Hannah cackled, then rested her chin on her interlocked fingers.", "\u2014Anyways, I\u2019ll keep it a secret, so just say it.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u2014Or don\u2019t, if you don\u2019t want to. You think I won\u2019t find out just because you stay silent?", "In the end, Seol Jihu revealed everything that happened until now.", "By the time the explanation came to an end, Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes had narrowed to a slit.", "\u2014He~eh. A collaboration for an expedition in exchange for a transfer\u2026.", "Her eyes rolled.", "\u2014That\u2019s intriguing, for sure. The conditions are too good.", "\u201cYou think so too, right? Maybe they\u2019re targeting me.\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked at Seol Jihu strangely before going \u2018Ah.\u2019", "\u2014Right, Master Jang is there.", "\u201c\u2026You really don\u2019t think I might have figured this out?\u201d", "\u2014As if.", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly.", "\u2014Anyways, expedition\u2026 expedition\u2026", "Kim Hannah tapped on her desk. It wasn\u2019t as if she knew everything there was to know about Paradise, and it certainly wasn\u2019t a strange thing for Earthlings to go on an expedition.", "But Kim Hannah showed suspicious movements like tilting her head or twisting up the corners of her mouth.", "\u2014It smells\u2026", "\u201cSmell?\u201d", "\u2014It smells fishy.", "Kim Hannah revealed a furtive smile.", "\u2014I can practically smell the rotting odor of shit.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but think about how Kim Hannah compared things to poop whenever something happened.", "\u2014Given what I know about that old man Bok Jungsik, there\u2019s no way he would proceed with something so reckless\u2026. Aha!", "Tak. She smacked the desk before staring at Seol Jihu.", "\u2014Hey.", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u2014You haven\u2019t gone ahead and accepted the offer, have you?", "\u201cWhy would I? I refused, obviously.\u201d", "\u2014Good. I\u2019ll be clear just in case. Don\u2019t interfere in this matter. Don\u2019t get yourself involved and don\u2019t be related to it in any way. Got it?", "\u201cI told you, I refused.\u201d", "\u2014We\u2019ll see about that.", "Kim Hannah snorted.", "It wasn\u2019t until a few days later that Seol Jihu found out what she meant.", "**", "\u201cWelcome. It\u2019s pretty hot today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Princess.\u201d", "\u201cYes, come in.\u201d", "Teresa came out to greet Seol Jihu and personally led him to the reception room.", "Teresa wasn\u2019t in her usual military uniform and was wearing an apron instead. Because of it, she exuded a cozy and graceful atmosphere rather than a lively and energetic one.", "\u201cI heard that you became Carpe Diem\u2019s new leader.\u201d", "\u201cAh, yes.\u201d", "\u201cYou must not have been taught all the duties and responsibilities that come with that position. It\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "\u201cIt is a bit unsettling, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d", "\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Would you like to wash up and rest? Or maybe you\u2019d like to eat something first?\u201d", "Saying this, Teresa suddenly blocked her mouth with her hand and dropped her head. Seeing how her withdrawn shoulders were trembling slightly, she seemed to be making considerable effort to rein in her laughter.", "\u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019", "\u201cNo, I already took a shower this morning. I also\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI see, then why don\u2019t you eat first?\u201d", "Teresa spoke gently as she personally took Seol Jihu\u2019s jacket off.", "\u201cAh, I\u2019ll hold onto it.\u201d", "Despite Seol Jihu\u2019s refusal, Teresa more or less ignored him and headed to the dining hall. As a result, Seol Jihu was able to enjoy the unexpected luxury of having the Princess\u2019s handmade food.", "Other than Teresa constantly asking \u2018Is it good?\u2019 and staring at him with her chin cupped in her hands, the meal couldn\u2019t be more excellent.", "Teresa spoke as she watched Seol Jihu tap his mouth with a napkin.", "\u201cMm, I guess this is enough for today.\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I was just talking to myself. Anyways~\u201d", "Teresa threw off her apron and returned to her usual appearance.", "\u201cI heard that you became Carpe Diem\u2019s new leader.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the same thing just a while ago?\u201d", "\u201cEii~ The meaning is different, you know~?\u201d", "Teresa giggled.", "\u201cAnyways, how does it feel, being a leader?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu thought for a moment before replying.", "\u201cThere are many things I want to do, but not much that I can actually do? That sounds about right for now.\u201d", "\u201cWhy? There\u2019s something even our Hero of Haramark can\u2019t do?\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know when he received another strange nickname, but he still smirked.", "\u201cThere are things in life you just can\u2019t do without money.\u201d", "Hearing the bitterness in Seol Jihu\u2019s tone, Teresa folded her arms.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. Money doesn\u2019t guarantee happiness, but it at least guarantees leisure.\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but agree seeing how realistic this was.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. If you\u2019re lacking money, you can just make more.\u201d", "\u201cRight, like how you can eat cake if you don\u2019t have bread.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head in agreement.", "\u201cAii, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d", "Teresa shook her hand.", "\u201cI\u2019m asking if you\u2019re interested in making money.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cListen. We\u2019re not the ones who came up with this plan, but an interesting proposition has been made to us a few days ago\u2026.\u201d", "As Seol Jihu listened attentively, his expression became more and more distorted.", "Teresa was chatting away until she saw Seol Jihu\u2019s grim expression.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d", "She trembled inwardly, wondering if she said something wrong.", "\u201cDid White Rose make this proposition?\u201d", "And when she heard this, she blinked her eyes.", "\u201c\u2026Oh, you already knew?\u201d", "\u201cPrincess.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s voice suddenly dropped an octave.", "\u201cDid White Rose tell you to ask us?\u201d", "His manner of speech changed as well.", "Feeling that something wasn\u2019t right, Teresa quickly fixed her posture.", "\u201cNo. White Rose made this proposition to collaborate, then asked us to introduce them to a good team if we knew one.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt sounded like a good offer, and Darling\u2019s, I mean, Carpe Diem\u2019s team popped up in my head\u2026.\u201d", "Teresa was speaking fluently when the end of her speech became blurred.", "\u201cPrincess.\u201d", "Seol Jihu slowly opened his mouth.", "\u201cIn truth, we visited White Rose a few days ago and heard the same offer.\u201d", "\u201cOh, you did? I didn\u2019t know.\u201d", "\u201cYes, and we refused.\u201d", "Seol Jihu had thought the matter was over when he refused them. However, the same offer had now returned to him through the Haramark Royal Family.", "Was this a coincidence? Or was it part of Bok Jungsik\u2019s scheme?", "Or\u2026 was this destiny?", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "\u201cHave you accepted?\u201d", "\u201cWe haven\u2019t given a definitive answer.\u201d", "Teresa shook her head.", "\u201cBut we gave a favorable answer. The evidence they provided was flawless. Since the villa belonged to an ancient emperor, even a rock lying around there might be made of gold. We could tell that White Rose made careful preparations for this expedition. They were offering us an opportunity to take a bite out of an already-prepared meal, so we didn\u2019t really want to refuse outright\u2026.\u201d", "Teresa mumbled before asking carefully.", "\u201cWhy did you refuse?\u201d", "Seol Jihu became speechless. At this rate, there was a huge chance that the Haramark Royal Family would participate in this expedition.", "He wanted to tell them not to go, but he couldn\u2019t think of a proper reason.", "Saying, \u2018You\u2019ll die if you go\u2019; he would be lucky to not be treated as a madman.", "\u2018Maybe I should reveal the existence of my Nine Eyes\u2026.\u2019", "If it were Teresa, perhaps she might believe him.", "He bit his lips lightly and fell into deep contemplation. Meanwhile, light flickered in Teresa\u2019s eyes as she watched the young man intently.", "The Seol Jihu she knew didn\u2019t cower no matter what wave came crashing in. He didn\u2019t shrink, nor did he back away.", "In fact, the more difficult the problem was, the more he would work to find a solution. The result he produced always impressed her as well.", "But now he was showing such disapproval for what seemed like a well-planned expedition\u2026", "\u2018Could it be?\u2019", "After staring at him for a moment, she initiated a conversation.", "\u201cYou see\u2014 I\u2019ve actually been thinking about not going\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shot his head up.", "\u201cWell\u2026 White Rose\u2019s offer was good and all, but I wasn\u2019t really sure about having to enter the Parasites\u2019 territory. I mean, they did tell us that they would travel by sea, and not land, but\u2026 you remember, right? What we experienced while we were escaping from the laboratory.\u201d", "Teresa continued nonchalantly.", "\u201cI\u2019m still jolted awake from sleep whenever I think about it. I don\u2019t want to crawl into that situation again just to make money.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2026\u201d", "Checking that Seol Jihu\u2019s complexion had brightened, Teresa dealt the finishing blow.", "\u201cEii, I\u2019ll just not go. Life is more important than money anyways.\u201d", "\u201cPrincess.\u201d", "\u201cPlease understand. I\u2019m a fickle woman, you see.\u201d", "\u201cRight, I agree. Well thought, Princess. Well thought.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t nitpick about she changed her tune completely. He nodded his head, relieved from the bottom of his heart.", "Seeing how the young man smoothed down his chest to finally relax, Teresa was convinced.", "\u2018I dodged a bullet.\u2019", "She hadn\u2019t changed her tune for no reason. Teresa had noticed the secret Seol Jihu was hiding a long time ago.", "To be more precise, it was when they were escaping from the Delphinion Laboratory. Although Teresa was the one who led the way, Seol Jihu was the one who told her about the enemy\u2019s whereabouts.", "At first, she found this rather mystical. But when the young man was spot on 100% of the time, she couldn\u2019t just chuck it up to him having good intuition.", "It wasn\u2019t as if he was an Archer. No, even if he was a High-rank Archer, it would be impossible for him to be right hundreds of times consecutively.", "She wasn\u2019t sure about the details, but it seemed likely that this mysterious ability of his had activated this time as well.", "In other words, there had to be a reason.", "A reason that the young man known as the \u2018problem-solver\u2019 was taking his foot out of this matter.", "Moreover\u2026", "\u2018If Hubby says don\u2019t go, I won\u2019t.\u2019", "Teresa smiled bashfully as she rubbed the apron she took off."]}
