The Threads of Bonds Coming Together (5)", "content": ["[Well done.]", "Gula spoke in a rare, upbeat voice.", "[Not only did you stop the Parasites\u2019 plan, but you also dealt their forces a considerable blow. Even the Parasite Queen should have no choice but to falter because of that.]", "It sounded like she was praising him. To confirm this, Seol Jihu bowed down and immediately felt a gentle touch stroking his hair. Was it because it was the hand of a goddess? He liked how warm it was.", "[Well done. You earned us a lot of time.]", "\u2018Time?\u2019", "[Yes, this event will serve as a sturdy breakwater for when you fully jump into the flow of fate in the future.]", "He was happy to be praised but not so much with her riddles.", "\u2018Goddess Gula, I may sound impertinent, but can you be a bit more straightforward?\u2019", "[What do you mean?]", "\u2018Straightforward. You always seem to say things in a roundabout way.\u2019", "[\u2026.]", "\u2018For example, the five Ws \u2014 who, what, when, where, why. If you could at least explain things this way, won\u2019t it be easier for both of us?\u2019", "His bold question stopped Gula\u2019s hand, and Seol Jihu felt a tapping on his head; almost as if Gula was contemplating, \u2018What should I do with this child?\u2019", "[Didn\u2019t I tell you before? Revealing profound secrets would greatly affect the law of causality.]", "\u2018Is it that important to not affect the law of causality?\u2019", "[Of course, it is. You can bring about a desired effect by interfering with the cause. But the law of causality is always impartial.]", "The gentle and consoling voice continued.", "[Even if you can make the scale tip on one side, the law of causality will always balance it back.]", "\u2018Do you mean to say if you affect the cause to bring about a favorable effect, the other side will be given a similar cause and effect?\u2019", "[That\u2019s right. And if we are not careful, it might nullify everything we have done until now.]", "\u2018Then I guess, I can\u2019t pester you about that\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu acquiesced quietly. Gula must have felt bad seeing his dejected look. Her voice rang out.", "[It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have things I want to say. Thankfully there are some possibilities ahead of us, so for the time being, be patient and focus on your growth. Worrying too much about this now would be the same as putting the cart before the horse.]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s ears perked up after hearing that there was a method to avoid the balancing effect of the law of causality. However, he didn\u2019t press for an explanation any further than he needed.", "Gula\u2019s serious tone made him feel that he shouldn\u2019t investigate the matter any further. Although his curiosity hadn\u2019t been satisfied, he decided to move along and finish what he came to do.", "The situation with his level was exactly as he expected it to be. By participating in the rescue mission, he had amassed quite a bit of experience and merit. His indirect involvement in the destruction of the laboratory and his subsequent survival against all odds gave him a large amount of contribution points.", "It was so much that\u2026.", "[In the name of Gula, I shall henceforth bestow Seol Jihu the title of Level 3 Mana Lancer! I expect great feats befitting the one-of-a-kind class from you!]", "\u2026He had experience points left over after he leveled up.", "\u2018What?\u2019", "Seol Jihu quickly raised his head, his excitement disappearing as a look of horror appeared on his face.", "[What\u2019s wrong?]", "\u2018T-The class name.\u2019", "[It\u2019s Mana Lancer.]", "Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped at Gula\u2019s firm answer, and then he quickly became depressed. After hesitating for a moment, he opened his eyes and muttered in his head, \u2018That\u2019s too harsh.\u2019", "[?]", "\u2018What the heck is a Mana Lancer\u2026.\u2019", "[What do you mean?]", "\u2018I mean, don\u2019t you have cooler class names? I\u2019m embarrassed to tell people my class name.\u2019", "[You little brat.]", "Seol Jihu felt more strength entering the hand stroking his head. He quickly asked before he got smacked.", "\u2018Gula-nim, there\u2019s something I want to ask.\u2019", "[Speak.]", "\u2018Would it be possible for you to awaken just one of the colors of the right side?\u2019", "[Not even remotely possible.]", "Just as he expected, Gula refused flatly. Seol Jihu was rubbing his hands together with a pleading smile, but as soon as he heard Gula\u2019s answer, his expression turned cold.", "[Don\u2019t even dream about it. The three colors of the right side are tied together and need to be awakened simultaneously. As I told you the last time, this takes a large amount of contribution points.]", "Hearing this reply, Seol Jihu grumbled inwardly, \u2018You\u2019re a goddess, so do you have to be so stingy? At the very least, can\u2019t you change my class name? Your naming sense sucks.\u2019 He complained in all possible ways.", "[Impertinent!]", "Thwack. In the end, Gula smacked him.", "\u2018Che!\u2019", "Seol Jihu rubbed his steaming head and snorted.", "\u2018Wait and see!\u2019", "He remembered hearing that Luxuria, the goddess of lust, was like a kind older sister, who would give you a warm embrace. Furthermore, her voice was said to be sensual.", "Seol Jihu vowed to start going to Luxuria\u2019s temple henceforth, instead of going here.", "[Whew\u2026.]", "While Gula sighed like she was disappointed, Seol Jihu confirmed the new abilities he could awaken. Mana Spear could evolve into \u2018Mana Spear - Multiple\u2019, but he passed on it for now since he planned to learn this himself.", "There was also the \u2018Aura\u2019, which amplified the cutting power and the destructive power of his spear. When he thought about how he learned this skill under Jang Maldong\u2019s training, a dumbfounded laugh escaped his mouth. Aura was a skill that could be learned at Level 3 and was extremely difficult to learn at Level 2.", "Old Man Maldong was only trying to help him learn how to materialize his mana. But one thing Jang Maldong had overlooked was Seol Jihu\u2019s abnormally high Mana stat, which easily contended with the \u2018High Rankers\u2019. He was able to learn Aura quickly with the help of Mana Circulation, which boasted a higher proficiency rank compared to his level, and the effect of Psychi\u2019s Tears.", "The old man\u2019s face at the time was quite a sight to behold.", "In any case, the remaining skill was the \u2018Flash Step\u2019, which sounded vaguely familiar.", "\u2018Some sort of a movement technique\u2026.?\u2019", "He felt like he\u2019d seen it before in martial arts novels, but that was it. A worried look appeared on his face. He was obviously thinking, \u2018Just how the heck am I supposed to learn this?\u2019", "[I see that you\u2019re worried.]", "\u2018No, it\u2019s just\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu shook his head, but upon realizing that Gula could read his mind, he laughed feebly.", "[Fufu, you are worried over nothing.]", "\u2018Worried over nothing?\u2019", "[You don\u2019t have to worry about what is to come. That is, as long as you don\u2019t choose to run away or do nothing. After all, you\u2019ve been weaving the threads of bonds one by one.]", "\u2018Ah, here she goes again with her enigmatic riddles.\u2019", "[The threads tied to you are trying to bind new bonds. So just be patient and wait.]", "He had no clue what she meant by threads or bonds. He also didn\u2019t like the word \u2018bind\u2019, since it sounded like he was forcing people. But the message as a whole seemed to be a good one.", "Seol Jihu nodded his head. He knew that talking back would only end up with him getting smacked. More importantly, his mind was currently filled with thoughts about Flash Step.", "*", "Jang Maldong must have been exhausted, as he lay sprawled on the couch. He had already met everyone he needed to, and wanted to head back. But people kept visiting him nonstop.", "It wasn\u2019t that he disliked it. In fact, he was rather grateful that they remembered him. But even good things needed to be in moderation.", "Plus, there were more than a few people who were expecting him to come out of retirement and return to Paradise. Also, it was a chore to have deep conversations.", "And that wasn\u2019t all. If there was one topic he heard more than his retirement, it was the newbie. Everyone who visited him brought up the newbie, so much so that he was starting to get annoyed. But then again, his interest was piqued.", "\u2018Wait, what was that guy\u2019s name again\u2026? Ah, no!\u2019", "He didn\u2019t finish his thought. He was retired. He didn\u2019t want to involve himself any further.", "\u201cI\u2019ll need to go back soon. If I stay any longer than this\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong picked up his tie and coat before anyone else could come to bother him. But the heavens weren\u2019t so kind.", "Knock, knock. Before he could even put on his tie, knocks rang out on the door. Jang Maldong let out a groan before plopping down on the couch and pressing his temples.", "\u201c\u2026Come in, the door is open.\u201d", "The door opened. Who was it this time? Jang Maldong narrowed his eyes and turned to the door, only to be surprised.", "\u201cIs anyone here?\u201d", "An old voice rang out. The visitor looked just as old as Jang Maldong. The important thing was that he was someone Jang Maldong had never seen before. The old visitor looked at Jang Maldong and asked quietly.", "\u201cExcuse me, is there an Earthling named Seol here?\u201d", "\u2018Right, it was Seol\u2026. Wait, Earthling?\u2019", "People from Earth rarely referred to themselves as Earthlings. In the first place, the word was coined to distinguish between Earthlings and Paradisians, so it was often used by Paradisians.", "\u201cHe seems to be out\u2026. Ah, come in.\u201d", "\u201cI see. Excuse me then, I\u2019ll be troubling you for a bit.\u201d", "The old visitor walked in and sat down on the couch across from Jang Maldong. Because the old visitor seemed to be the same age as him, Jang Maldong spoke politely, \u201cWould you like to drink some tea while you wait?\u201d", "The old visitor did the same.", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Plus, I am not an Earthling.\u201d", "\u201cDoes it matter whether you are an Earthling or a Paradisian? Haha.\u201d", "Jang Maldong chuckled before brewing two cups of tea and handing one to the old visitor.", "\u201cT-Thank you.\u201d", "\u201cNo problem. That\u2019s a traditional Korean tea made from tea leaves found on Earth. It\u2019s sweet even though it doesn\u2019t have any sugar in it.\u201d", "The old visitor carefully took a sip before nodding his head.", "\u201cIt tastes wonderful!\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m happy that you like it. If you\u2019d like, I can bring some for you to take back home.\u201d", "Seeing Jang Maldong roar with laughter, the old visitor was slightly taken aback. It seemed like he didn\u2019t know what to make of the unexpected treatment.", "After taking a few more sips, Jang Maldong finally asked what he was wondering.", "\u201cPardon me, but who might you be? Why are you trying to find that young man?\u201d He asked politely.", "As the old visitor was used to being treated as an NPC, he couldn\u2019t help but see Jang Maldong in a different light. He quickly fixed his posture to look like a gentleman before finally opening his mouth.", "\u201cI\u2019m the village head of Ramman Village. I came to thank him on behalf of the village.\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "Jang Maldong was taken by surprise at the old visitor\u2019s unexpected reason for stopping by. It was then. Kiik. The door creaked open. Two pairs of eyes turned to the side simultaneously and found a young man walking in dejectedly.", "\u201cHuh?\u201d", "Seol Jihu must have seen the village head as he let out a surprised voice.", "\u201cVillage head?\u201d", "Only then did the village head reveal a gentle smile.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d", "*", "Seol Jihu and the village head conversed cordially for a long time. The atmosphere was quite decent, which was to be expected, given how much help they had given each other.", "After being relegated to a spectator, Jang Maldong carefully listened to their conversation.", "\u201cYou must be a fool, telling the king to use the gold bar you earned for our village. Do you know how surprised I was hearing that?\u201d", "\u2018What?\u2019", "Jang Maldong was listening with his chin on his hand when he heard what the village head said and raised his head.", "He earned what and used it how?", "\u201cI remembered you saying that you wanted to move to the city. I don\u2019t really like carrying debts on my shoulders, you see.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s quite the way of paying back your debts. How did you manage to convince the king? I doubt he agreed easily.\u201d", "\u201cHe was troubled at first, so I had to tell him about your invaluable contribution on making the rescue mission a success. Ah, I also made sure to explain your circumstances, so you won\u2019t have to worry about being bothered by him.\u201d", "\u201cPlease! He already came to see me personally and indirectly asked if I would lend the royal family a hand.\u201d", "\u201cHuuh?\u201d", "\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about it too much. He said he wouldn\u2019t mention my past, and I told him that I\u2019d think about it.\u201d", "Despite what he was saying, the village head seemed happy that the king personally came to recruit him. At that moment, Seol Jihu was suddenly reminded of Gula\u2019s words about \u2018binding\u2019 others with bonds. But he quickly forgot about it and congratulated the old man.", "The village head let out a dry cough. That was when he saw Jang Maldong sitting there in a daze and went, \u201cAh.\u201d He realized he had gotten swept away by the atmosphere and ended up talking too much.", "\u201cAh, he is\u2026.\u201d", "When Seol Jihu tried to introduce him, Jang Maldong opened his mouth, \u201cI\u2019m Jang Maldong, an insignificant villager.\u201d", "\u201cJang Maldong?\u201d", "The village head showed signs of being startled.", "\u201cCould you be Haramark\u2019s famous martial arts master\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a false reputation.\u201d", "The village head shook his head.", "\u201cFalse reputation? I see that you\u2019re humble. Even among Paradisians, there are few who have not heard of the name Jang Maldong.\u201d", "After saying that, the village head held out his hand, \u201cThis insignificant villager is named Arbor Muto. May I have the honor?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to take your hand.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t be. I know full well just how much you\u2019ve done for Paradise until now. Since even the Head of a remote village knows about you, what more is there to say?\u201d", "Once the village head put it that way, Jang Maldong found it harder to refuse. Seol Jihu watched the two old men shake hands and smiled in awe.", "\u2018Old Man Maldong really is amazing!\u2019", "After shaking hands, the village head, no, Arbor Muto got up. Jang Maldong followed him in a hurry.", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay a little longer?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You see, the entire village has been quite busy preparing for the migration.\u201d", "Jang Maldong couldn\u2019t say much once he heard this. Arbor Muto looked back and forth between Jang Maldong and Seol Jihu before smiling happily.", "\u201cI was thinking that this man was different\u2026. It seems it\u2019s all thanks to you. Mm, it is normal for a courageous master to nurture a courageous disciple.\u201d", "\u201cN-No\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThen I must thank you as well. You helped save the lives of hundreds of villagers.\u201d", "Jang Maldong was flustered. This old man in front of him seemed to be mistaken about something. However, Arbor Muto continued unfazed.", "\u201cYou have an excellent disciple. I\u2019m envious.\u201d", "At that moment, Jang Maldong\u2019s eyes opened wide. He looked dazed as if he had just been struck in the head with a hammer.", "\u201cI\u2019ll see you off.\u201d", "\u201cPlease, don\u2019t. I\u2019ll be uncomfortable if you do.\u201d", "Arbor Muto walked towards the door before suddenly stopping.", "\u201cAh\u2026 there\u2019s actually one thing I forgot to mention. Well, it\u2019s more of a request.\u201d", "\u201cPlease, go ahead.\u201d", "Arbor Muto rummaged through his pockets before taking out a folded piece of paper.", "\u201cHave you heard of Huge Stone Rocky Mountain?\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. He had no clue, but this was a place Jang Maldong was familiar with. After all, this was where countless memories from when he was in his prime were buried. Then again, it was a place of nightmares for Chohong and Hugo.", "Seol Jihu took the folded paper and asked.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a map to my hideout in that mountain.\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be so surprised of?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Just how many hideouts do you have?\u201d", "Arbor Muto paused for a moment before replying, \u201cTwenty-two?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThe smart ones are always digging tunnels to escape for when they need to.\u201d", "After snickering like a child, he continued, \u201cAnyways, it\u2019s close to Haramark. It will only take a day by carriage.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d", "\u201cNothing much. There should be a few worn-down equipment and books lying around. All you have to do is bring them to me.\u201d", "\u201cThat sounds easy.\u201d", "\u201cIt should be. But, I recommend you to be careful. It\u2019s been a while since anyone\u2019s visited that place, and because I built the hideout in a cave, I don\u2019t know what might be dwelling in it now.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head slowly.", "\u201cWhen do you need them?\u201d", "\u201cYou can take your time. As you know, I\u2019ve been a bit busy lately. You can go when you\u2019re bored and want a fresh breath of air.\u201d", "\u201cSo it looks like I have time.\u201d Seol Jihu smiled brightly.", "\u201cAlso\u2026.\u201d", "Arbor Muto made a furtive smile.", "\u201cI plan on paying with what\u2019s inside the hideout. Is that okay?\u201d", "\u201cWith what\u2019s inside the hideout?\u201d", "\u201cYes, there should be items and potions inside. They\u2019re nothing great, so I understand if you\u2019d rather take money.\u201d", "\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d Seol Jihu agreed immediately, remembering that the village head was a distinguished Mage back in the day.", "\u201cAnyways, you can go when you have time.\u201d With that, Arbor Muto left the office.", "\u201cWhat kind of person is he?\u201d Jang Maldong finally snapped out of his daze and asked as soon as the door closed shut. Seol Jihu hesitated as if he found it difficult to answer him.", "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of man who belongs in a remote village.\u201d", "\u201cHow did you know?\u201d", "\u201cHe didn\u2019t look simple, and I could easily figure it out from your conversation. If the king personally made him an offer, he shouldn\u2019t be an ordinary old man.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s true.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can keep secrets.\u201d", "Seol Jihu scratched his cheek and opened his mouth like he didn\u2019t have a choice.", "\u201cHe went into seclusion, but he was once a famous Mage in the Delphinion Duchy.\u201d", "\u201cDelphinion Duchy,\u201d Jang Maldong exclaimed in surprise.", "\u201cA Mage from the Empire. He\u2019s an even bigger man than I imagined.\u201d", "\u201cThe Empire? But he\u2019s from the Delphinion Duchy.\u201d", "\u201cDelphinion Duchy was one of the duchies under the duke families of the Empire.\u201d", "Having heard this for the first time, Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cBut that old man sure likes to go about things in a roundabout way. He could have just told you straight out. Instead, he makes it a request\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong snickered before suddenly raising his arm with a gentle face, and placing his hand on the young man\u2019s shoulder.", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "Tap, tap. He tapped his shoulders a couple of times and smiled. This was the first smile Seol Jihu was seeing.", "*", "Despite saying he would leave as soon as possible, Jang Maldong stayed for another day under the pretext he would see Chohong and Hugo one more time. Of course, his real reason was something else.", "He couldn\u2019t get his meeting with Arbor Muto out of his mind. He couldn\u2019t forget the words that were said to him. A refreshing feeling constantly surged inside him, not wanting to disappear.", "He had been full of complaints, but now he wanted to stay in Paradise.", "Of course, staying in Paradise came with the risk of having to meet someone. And Jang Maldong\u2019s intuition was spot on.", "\u201cMaldong!\u201d", "Ian came to visit him once more. Jang Maldong showed clear hints of being tired, but after being convinced by Ian\u2019s words that this might be the last chance for them to drink together, he headed to Eat, Drink, and Enjoy.", "\u201cI thought you would have already left by now. I\u2019m surprised.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m leaving soon.\u201d", "\u201cC\u2019mon, do you really have to?\u201d", "\u201cOf course, I won\u2019t really be welcomed if I stayed anyway.\u201d", "\u201cHa!

Haramark still needs you!\u201d", "In truth, Ian Denzel was one of the people Jang Maldong was most uncomfortable around. That was because Ian was one of his closest friends who earnestly wished for his return.", "\u201cWhew\u2026.\u201d", "Seeing Jang Maldong staying silent, Ian heaved out a deep sigh. He must have drunk quite a lot as the smell of alcohol oozed out of his mouth.", "\u201cRoger, Garp, Sengoku\u2026. There aren\u2019t many left who know the old Paradise.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s been dozens of years. It\u2019s obvious\u2026.\u201d", "Jang Maldong was nodding his head in agreement when\u2026. \u201cWhat? Ro\u2026 Who?\u201d", "He furrowed his brows and asked back.

Ian smacked the table, his eyes flickering with light.", "\u201cSo you should come back.\u201d", "Jang Maldong put on a tired expression at Ian\u2019s jump in logic.", "\u201cYou sure are persistent, I\u2019ll give you that.
