{"cid": "145", "title": "Chapter 145. Choice of Destiny (5)", "content": ["The heated bickering full of back-and-forth turns eventually changed over to a fierce battle of baiting.", "Seol Jihu tried persuading her, saying there was a real reason for them to not go to the villa and that he would take her to Scheherazade today instead. However, it was difficult to placate the excited Flone.", "Who could blame her? After all, flying around the world as an incorporeal spirit was something everyone must have imagined at least once. Since the expedition was even laced with a stimulating description called \u2018forbidden\u2019, it wasn\u2019t surprising for Flone, who was thirsty for adventure, to be so excited.", "For a while, Seol Jihu stood his ground with firm \u2018NOs\u2019. However, when Flone took out her secret weapon of crying tears of blood, he had no choice but to surrender.", "Do you think I\u2019m going only out of curiosity? Grandpa adored me when I was little. If he were alive, I wouldn\u2019t have been buried alive. It might be late, but I want to retrieve his body and give him a proper burial. And so on and so forth.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t resist when she lamented nonstop.", "In the end, Seol Jihu agreed, but only after making her promise to guarantee their safety.", "But even if he wanted to go, there were problems that hindered them.", "\u2018I don\u2019t even know where it is.\u2019", "All he knew was that Phi Sora left the port of Nur on a ship. But as it looked like Flone would remember if she was in the area, he ignored this part.", "Another problem was that this matter was wrapped up in great controversy. Since standing out wouldn\u2019t do any good, he didn\u2019t dare to ask his comrades for help. After all, he might cause them trouble by getting them wrapped up in the controversy as well.", "Thus, Seol Jihu made up a story about having something to do and prepared to travel alone.", "He never imagined that things would turn out this way, and he definitely had his worries, but he changed his mind when he saw Flone\u2019s bright, joyful smile.", "\u2018I\u2019ll just think of it as paying her back.\u2019", "Thinking about it now, this was the first time Flone \u2014 the Giving Tree \u2014 wanted something so much. Letting her have this one thing should be fine.", "Thinking so, Seol Jihu hopped onto the carriage to Nur.", "**", "Tap, tap- The sound of footsteps rang out in a hallway.", "A deathly silence filled the interior of the villa, and total darkness made things barely visible. In addition, chilly air cold enough to cause goosebumps flowed around in the atmosphere.", "A group of people walked in this dark hallway, relying only on a torch flickering precariously.", "But soon, the header stopped, having come to a dead-end.", "A dusty, dilapidated wall revealing a long passage of time caught Phi Sora\u2019s eyes, and she let out a sigh.", "\u2018Again.\u2019", "The hallway was blocked. She lost count of how many times they had experienced the same thing.", "She stared at the wall with tired eyes before turning around and checking on the group.", "\u2018One, two.\u2019", "Her comrades didn\u2019t look any better, having emaciated complexions.", "\u2018Three, four.\u2019", "In truth, the group was unable to tell night from day and had even lost track of the number of days that passed since they entered.", "\u2018Five\u2026.\u2019", "Phi Sora counted five people. Six, including her.", "The group had 18 members at the start of the expedition, yet 12 had disappeared.", "Right, they didn\u2019t die. They vanished after entering this villa.", "\u2018How?\u2019", "How did things turn out like this?", "Phi Sora bit down on her cracked lips.", "The start wasn\u2019t bad. Entering the villa went smoothly, and exploring the 1st floor wasn\u2019t any more difficult than the tests of courage she\u2019d had in college.", "When the group was collecting the treasures and luxury goods lying around in the villa, she thought she had finally hit the jackpot after spending such a long time in Paradise.", "The problem began when they climbed up the stairs.", "After exploring the second, third, and then the fourth floor, they were ready to go back home, delighted. However, they couldn\u2019t find the staircase. They returned the way they came from, yet the staircase had vanished.", "Having explored the villa for dozens of hours, the expedition group was dead tired. They chose to set up a campsite, but when Phi Sora woke up from her sleep, she couldn\u2019t see the two members who were supposed to be standing watch. Next, four members who went to look around the area disappeared without a trace.", "Enraged, Phi Sora conducted a thorough search of the villa, but she couldn\u2019t find the six missing people anywhere.", "The remaining members continued to vanish. The tail guard would disappear in the middle of an exploration, or one or two members would disappear if Phi Sora took her eyes off of them for just one second.", "Just like that, only six people were left.", "She knew the gravity of the situation she was in.", "But what unhinged her the most was\u2026", "Drrrk\u2014", "\u2026the mysterious sound ringing out from an undiscoverable location.", "On one hand, it sounded like someone forcefully opening a rusty door, while on the other, it sounded like an unknown creature lightly dragging its feet on a run-down wooden floor.", "The important thing was that the sound rang out whenever she was starting to forget. And once this sound reached her ears, someone would always disappear.", "Gulp. Someone swallowed hard.", "\u201cUnni\u2026.\u201d", "A girl wearing a Priest\u2019s robe teared up.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be scared.\u201d", "Phi Sora\u2019s eyes turned sharp.", "\u201cAnd don\u2019t talk weak. This son of a bitch is doing this on purpose. It\u2019s getting enjoyment out of seeing our reactions.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cNo buts. If this thing was anything special, it would have appeared in front of us a long time ago. Think about it. Why else would it play around so shamelessly?\u201d", "Drrk, drrrrrk!", "Immediately, an unpleasant racket resounded in the hallway. It was as if the mysterious creature was laughing in ridicule.", "Phi Sora clenched her teeth and forced herself to continue talking.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll stop the search here. Next, we\u2014\u201d", "Whoosh. The torchlight flickered off.", "The moment Phi Sora\u2019s eyes shot open\u2026", "Drrrk!", "All six people could feel it.", "Drrrrrrrrrrrrrrk!", "From the other side of the hallway, something was fiercely charging toward them.", "\u201cUAAAAAAAH!\u201d", "\u201cAAAAAAAAK!\u201d", "Piercing screams echoed out in the hallway.", "**", "After arriving at Nur, Seol Jihu waited until dawn to head to the port.", "After going to a desolate place he had seen in the afternoon, he checked to see if anyone was watching before entrusting his body to Flone.", "The method Seol Jihu chose to cross the sea was flight. He was making use of the fact that Flone could exercise physical force if she wanted to.", "Taking a boat was also an option, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he could find a captain who would be willing. More importantly, he would attract attention by taking a boat. As Seol Jihu dreamed of committing the perfect crime, flying in Flone\u2019s arms was the safest approach.", "\u2018It\u2019s much faster too.\u2019", "Crossing the dark sea splattering with waves, Seol Jihu felt his heart pound. He felt a little guilty, like a kid who was doing something mischievous.", "How much time went by?", "Seol Jihu slicked his hair up to prevent it from fluttering in the air and discovered a coast getting nearer in the darkness.", "Technically speaking, this seaside marked the start of the Parasites\u2019 territory.", "\u201cHow is it? Do you remember anything?\u201d", "[I\u2019m not sure. Kind of\u2026?]", "Flone, who was traversing the sea in a straight line, gently turned to the side. At the same time, Seol Jihu activated his Nine Eyes.", "\u2018Holy shit!\u2019", "He immediately swallowed his breath. The entire coast became dyed in a shade of yellow.", "\u2018Attention Required.\u2019", "Hesitation emerged on Seol Jihu\u2019s complexion. He knew this area was the Parasites\u2019 territory, but from what he had heard, their army often wasn\u2019t stationed here.", "Judging by the color of the shore, perhaps the information was wrong.", "\u2018Maybe it\u2019s better to just go back\u2026.\u2019", "[Huh?]", "At that moment, Flone yelped after flying around the coast for a long time.", "[I found it!]", "Seol Jihu looked around the area and saw a lone building shining in a different light.", "\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s the place?\u201d", "[I\u2019m sure. Sacrificium, the villa on the cliff.]", "Just like Flone said, the building was standing at the edge of the shore cliff. Perhaps because it was still dark, it gave off an ominous aura standing by itself in the middle of nowhere.", "The problem was that the villa was colorless.", "\u2018Why?\u2019", "According to Flone, the villa was an incredibly dangerous place. Seol Jihu for sure thought the color of danger would appear. However, the villa was colorless no matter how he looked at it.", "Was it related to the shore being yellow?", "He couldn\u2019t be sure, except for one thing. From now, even a seemingly insignificant action could determine life or death. No, it certainly would.", "Flone stopped near the villa.", "Seol Jihu stared at the camouflage army helmet in his hand. He had spent quite a large sum of money to purchase this equipment, which could only be used one time but had a fantastic effect.", "His original plan was to send Flone in and camp out nearby in hiding. But since the surrounding area was dyed in yellow, he had no choice but to change his mind.", "\u2018What should I do?\u2019", "Looking at the yellow color, he felt uneasy about separating from Flone and staying alone. But he didn\u2019t want to go inside the villa together either.", "In truth, ever since he escaped from the laboratory in the Parasites\u2019 territory, he never wanted to step even one foot in there again.", "\u2018Do I just hide out underwater?\u2019", "He hated the idea of staying in the Parasites\u2019 territory to the point of having such an absurd thought. But in the next moment, he shook his head.", "It wasn\u2019t as if there weren\u2019t flying creatures among the Parasites. If ocean waves swept him away to the open ocean, he would be in a terrible position.", "He couldn\u2019t see rocks or any tiny islands to hide on either.", "\u2018How troublesome.\u2019", "[Um, what are you going to do?]", "A fidgety voice rang out in his already-confused head.", "\u201cDo you need to go?\u201d", "Perhaps sensing the hint of annoyance in Seol Jihu\u2019s voice, Flone dropped her head.", "[I want to go\u2026.]", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "[Being curious is one reason\u2026 but I really want to find Grandpa. There\u2019s something I want to ask when I meet him\u2026.]", "\u201cBut there\u2019s no guarantee that your grandfather is in the villa.\u201d", "[Yes, but\u2026 it\u2019s not a matter of possibilities. That\u2019s the only place he can be at.]", "\u201c?\u201d", "[We were told about the assassination, but we never got his body back.]", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows and raised his gaze. He could see a ghost staring at the villa with an ardent expression.", "[I realized after I died.]", "Flone continued.", "[I became free thanks to you, but most spirits who were once living are restrained to a specific place.]", "\u201cBy a specific place, you mean\u2026.\u201d", "[The place they died.]", "Flone emphasized.", "[If he isn\u2019t in the villa, he must have become a free spirit and left, or passed on to the afterlife. Since we can\u2019t really find him if that is the case, I can give up on finding him without regrets.]", "With Flone saying all this, Seol Jihu\u2019s expression softened.", "\u201c\u2026What do you want to ask him?\u201d", "[This.]", "The pendant on Seol Jihu\u2019s neck clattered.", "[I\u2019m curious why Mother left me this and why she said what she did when she placed this on my coffin\u2026.]", "Hearing her sorrowful voice, Seol Jihu bit his lips.", "\u2018Now that I think about it\u2026.\u2019", "[That necklace\u2026.]", "[A fragment of the Seven Virtues. You did well to find that.]", "After a short silence, Seol Jihu asked.", "\u201cHow does it look?\u201d", "[Hm?]", "\u201cThe villa, I mean.\u201d", "[Oh, who knows? I don\u2019t feel any presence worth noting\u2026. It\u2019s just that\u2026]", "\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026?\u201d", "[It\u2019s strange. It feels like it\u2019s gesturing at me to come in\u2026. That\u2019s the only way I can describe this feeling.]", "Seol Jihu crossed his arms and lowered his head.", "\u2018I have to make the right decision.\u2019", "Going together or staying alone.", "After looking back and forth between the colorlessness and the yellow color, Seol Jihu decided.", "\u201cYou can go.\u201d", "[I can go?]", "\u201cYes, but we\u2019re going together.\u201d", "[E-Eh? You\u2019re coming too? Really?]", "\u201cIt might help you ask if you have this pendant.\u201d", "Although this was the reasoning he gave, the real reason was that he trusted his Nine Eyes.", "Of course, the Nine Eyes was more varying than one might think. Although the villa might be colorless now, entering it or touching something wrong could instantly change the color to something more sinister.", "\u2018But\u2026\u2019", "Even while taking that into account, Seol Jihu thought it was better to go in.", "He didn\u2019t know why, but he had a strong feeling that staying near Flone would greatly increase his chance of survival.", "He would be able to deal with any situation that comes up too.", "[Really? We\u2019re both really going?]", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "A sigh heavy enough to sink the ocean escaped Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth.", "\u201cBut don\u2019t forget the promise you made me.\u201d", "[Yeah! Of course!]", "Flone shouted joyfully.", "Soon\u2026 the young man and the ghost circled around the cliff and disappeared inside the villa.", "*", "Seol Jihu and Flone entered the villa without much trouble. Because the villa was extremely dark, Seol Jihu turned on the illuminating stone he had brought along.", "\u201cHm\u2026.\u201d", "The villa looked rather small from the outside, but as expected, the interior made him exclaim in awe automatically.", "He could see traces of the place having been rummaged recently as if to say that the place had been worn down through the passage of time. One thing that surprised him was that there weren\u2019t many ornaments and luxury goods that would be worth taking.", "\u2018Did they take everything\u2026?\u2019", "\u201cThey should have left some for me\u2026\u201d Seol Jihu murmured to himself before suddenly remembering Phi Sora.", "He wouldn\u2019t have to worry if she died or went back after the expedition, but there was a chance that she was still here. He had to be careful not to run into her.", "[So this is the Sacrificium\u2026.]", "\u201cFlone? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything nearby.\u201d", "[Yeah. Let\u2019s go somewhere else.]", "\u201cDon\u2019t forget. We can\u2019t stay here for more than an hour.\u201d", "[Okay, okay.]", "Where should I go? Flone wondered to herself before going up the stairs. Worried that he would get separated, Seol Jihu quickly chased after her.", "At first, the desolate, ghastly atmosphere bothered him. But the uncomfortable feeling disappeared as he conversed with Flone.", "Perhaps because of the black smoke Flone continuously emitted, Seol Jihu seemed to get used to the surroundings as time went on.", "After wandering around the second floor for a long time, Flone pushed open a door. There was furniture and bed inside, but it seemed overly luxurious to be a simple lodging room.", "Seol Jihu spotted a portrait of a woman smiling kindly, then when he saw the small drawer underneath it, his eyes widened.", "The White Rose Guild must have missed this room as a beautiful ornament was placed on top of the drawer.", "It was a large glass cup. The stem was crystalline, and the bowl was crafted with gems. Inside, tantalizing grape-like golden orbs were stacked on top.", "\u2018Just taking one would be\u2026.\u2019", "Since one gold coin was 550 million Won, the gold orb should easily go for a billion Won.", "[You can take it.]", "Seeing Seol Jihu entranced by the cup, Flone whispered.", "\u201cI, I can?\u201d", "[Yep. It\u2019s not like it has an owner.]", "\u201cBut the emperor\u2026.\u201d", "[Don\u2019t worry. That greedy emperor was beheaded at a guillotine.]", "In other words, he had been killed elsewhere.", "In that case, there was no reason for Seol Jihu to hesitate.", "Seol Jihu approached the jeweled cup and stared at the golden orbs with a look of rapture.", "\u2018Just how many are there?\u2019", "There seemed to be at least ten orbs in there.", "[The cup\u2019s pretty too. Let\u2019s take it.]", "Seol Jihu nodded in a daze.", "\u2018This place really is a treasure trove.\u2019", "To think just one room would have such an incredible treasure\u2026.", "It was then\u2026", "While Seol Jihu was picking up the orbs with his jaw dropped, he suddenly felt a strange gaze. When he looked up, following his instincts\u2026", "\u201c!\u201d", "His body froze stiff and his eyes widened.", "The kindly smiling woman in the portrait now had the corners of her mouth hanging by her ears.", "When he met the eyes of the woman, whose head had turned at a strange angle, his breath stopped. His scream became stuck in his throat.", "[What\u2019s wrong?]", "Seeing Seol Jihu frozen, Flone looked up without much thought. Then, when she saw the woman smiling frighteningly\u2026.", "[NOOO!]", "She let out a short scream and swung her arm subconsciously.", "In that instant, Seol Jihu barely managed to snap out of his daze. A clear scene became etched in his mind.", "Flone\u2019s sharp nails scratched the portrait mercilessly\u2026", "Tzzzzt!", "And the smiling woman\u2019s face turned to stupor.", "[You surprised me!]", "It didn\u2019t take long for the portrait to transform into an unrecognizable mess."]}
