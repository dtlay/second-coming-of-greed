While charging forward at breakneck speed, he curled up, spread his mana to every corner of his body, then let it explode instantly.", "Tong! Along with a boom of the air detonating, Seol Jihu shot forward like an arrow.", "Abilities that were unlocked with each level-up were separated into two categories\u2014 an evolved version of an already-learned ability or an entirely new ability.", "He had learned Flash Step at Level 3, and Flash Thunder, which he unlocked at Level 4, was an evolved version of Flash Step.", "Meaning, raising his proficiency in Flash Step would be his shortcut for acquiring Flash Thunder.", "Of course, with Jang Maldong\u2019s personality, Seol Jihu rarely dug just one well while training.", "Tong! Just as Seol Jihu performed Flash Step once more\u2026", "\u201cNow!\u201d", "Jang Maldong shouted at the top of his voice.", "At the same time, Phi Sora, who was standing apathetically to the side, swung a bucket she was holding in her hand.", "The colorful stones sitting inside the bucket shot out and hurled toward Seol Jihu.", "The distance between Seol Jihu and the stones shortened in an instant.

Moreover, he was feeling the effect of this absurd training.", "His Intuition skill, which had remained at the same level for a long time, was growing by the day.", "*", "With a new location, the content of the training was naturally different as well.", "Another training Jang Maldong ordered was shadow boxing \u2014 selecting an imaginary opponent and studying ways to attack and defend alone.", "After giving it some thought, Seol Jihu chose Phi Sora as his imaginary opponent. Of course, he could also fight her in real life, but the main purpose of this training was \u2018to think\u2019.", "After engraving what Hugo said deep into his mind, Seol Jihu closed his eyes and racked his brain intensely.", "[I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a long time.

It was because he couldn\u2019t believe he heard those words from Jang Maldong.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no helping it. Judging from your explanation, the Misfortune-Delivering Curse Spear is more like a magic spell than a spear technique. And a very high-level spell, at that. Digging one well is hard enough. It\u2019s better to use contribution points to learn it than to waste precious time.\u201d", "Due to the habit he started developing since he was in the Neutral Zone, Seol Jihu had an aversion to easily acquiring abilities.

The abilities\u2019 explanations make them even more confusing, especially this Punishing Spear.\u201d", "Seol Jihu agreed with him on this. Delivering an \u2018absolute\u2019 counterattack that equals the damage taken.

It might even be more difficult than Sword Qi.\u201d", "Sword Qi was the crowning symbol of High Ranker Warriors.", "As it was their representative technique, it wasn\u2019t easy to acquire it through one\u2019s own efforts.", "Even Phi Sora had acquired Sword Qi after acquiring One With the Sword.", "Since Jang Maldong said this Floral Substitution technique was even more difficult than Sword Qi, Seol Jihu could only imagine how difficult it must be to learn it.", "\u201cFloral Substitution (\u79fb\u82b1\u63a5\u6728).
