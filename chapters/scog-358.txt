I\u2019m Sorry", "content": ["The time was 6 p.m.", "Seol Jihu finally arrived at his parents\u2019 house.", "Stopping in front of the main entrance, Seol Jihu stood still for a long time with his head dropped.", "His heart pounded from fear of what was to come.", "Looking back, every time he came back home, he had left thinking, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have come.\u2019", "Would it be any different this time?", "He didn\u2019t think so. That\u2019s why he hesitated.", "Standing like a stone statue for some time, a laugh escaped Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth.", "In Paradise, he was a hero who was welcomed and acknowledged by everyone. But on Earth\u2026 he was no different than unrecyclable trash.", "That\u2019s what made him laugh.", "\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d", "Seol Jihu raised his head.", "How long had he been there for? Seol Wooseok was standing on the staircase, looking down at him.", "\u201cHyung.\u201d", "\u201cYou said you\u2019d be here by six. Were you just standing there for thirty minutes? Did your shoes get glued to the ground or something?\u201d", "Seol Wooseok chuckled before coming down and opening the main entrance.", "He scanned Seol Jihu from top to bottom, then whistled.", "\u201cIya~ You\u2019re all dressed up in a suit. Is it because it\u2019s Mother\u2019s birthday? I see that you brought gifts too.\u201d", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s Mother\u2019s birthday and it\u2019s also been a while\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYou have something for me too?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. It\u2019s nothing expensive though, so don\u2019t look forward to it too much.\u201d", "\u201cHaha, thanks. You just came back from overseas, right? Aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d", "\u201cHm? Overseas?\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you went on a business trip? You didn\u2019t go overseas?\u201d", "Seol Wooseok asked with widened eyes.", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cNo, it was domestic. I never went overseas. Though, I might relatively soon.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 I see. It was so hard to get in touch with you that I figured you weren\u2019t in Korea.\u201d", "\u201cAh, that makes sense.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded strongly.", "\u201cEven the Reserve Forces called, you know.\u201d", "\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry about that. I took care of it. Sinyoung has a workplace reserve force unit, so I\u2019m transferring there.\u201d", "\u201cYou should have done that earlier. Anyway, let\u2019s go in. Mother\u2019s been waiting for a while now. Seonhwa and Seunghae are here as well.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok looked back at the house and then pulled on Seol Jihu\u2019s arm. The latter resisted slightly and objected.", "\u201cHyung, wait. I gave this some thought, and\u2014\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I already let them know.\u201d", "\u201cBut today\u2019s supposed to be a day of celebration. I can come back some other time\u2026\u201d", "\u201cToday is a day of celebration. That\u2019s why we should have more good things happen. Are you really going to go back after coming all the way here?\u201d", "Before he noticed, Seol Jihu found himself walking up the staircase and standing at the front door.", "Seol Wooseok punched in the password while holding onto Seol Jihu\u2019s arm.", "\u201cYou told me, remember? That you\u2019d visit once you finished paying off your debt.\u201d", "\u201cHyung\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI know. You must be uncomfortable. But there\u2019s going to be no end to this if you keep putting it off because of guilt. If you really want to seek forgiveness, don\u2019t run away. We can\u2019t forgive you if you don\u2019t come ask for our forgiveness.\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t argue because he knew his brother was right.", "\u201cCome in. And this time, make it clear. That you quit gambling and are working diligently.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok said encouragingly, then turned the doorknob.", "Seol Jihu still hadn\u2019t prepared his heart, but the door opened cold-heartedly.", "He first saw a middle-aged woman fidgeting nervously in deep concern. She jolted when she saw the door open, and her jaw dropped when she caught sight of Seol Jihu.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth opened slightly, but no sound came out.", "\u201cJihu\u2019s here.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok said clearly.", "\u201cAigoo, aigoo, my son\u2026 my second baby\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s mother walked up to him and squeezed his arm.", "\u201cM-Mother.\u201d", "\u201cAigoo, how can you not call even once until now? Do you have any idea how worried I was?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have come visit sooner\u2026\u201d", "\u201cHe said he wouldn\u2019t show up until he paid off his debts. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll visit more often from now on.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok said with a smile.", "Their mother couldn\u2019t take her eyes off her second son, whom she hadn\u2019t seen for a long time.", "Staring fixedly, she reached out with her hands and gently caressed Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "Seol Jihu stiffened up at a loss for what to do. Seeing her eyes glistening with tears, he felt guilty just meeting her eyes.", "\u201cMother, the food is going to go bad.\u201d", "Thankfully, Seol Wooseok stepped in.", "\u201cAh, I almost forgot.\u201d", "She laughed cheerfully.", "\u201cWhat am I doing just making you stand there? Come in, Jihu, come in. Let\u2019s eat first.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok passed the baton to his mother, and Seol Jihu was pulled inside once again.", "His heart beast faster and faster and his mind was in chaos.", "But when he arrived at the dinner table, his heart sank.", "Three people were already sitting at the table.", "Yoo Seonhwa, who was staring at him calmly; Yoo Seunghae, who was nervously clutching her older sister\u2019s hand; and Seol Jinhee, who was glaring at him fiercely.", "He couldn\u2019t see his father anywhere.", "\u201cSit here, Jihu. You must be hungry. Hurry and eat.\u201d", "His mother pulled out the chair next to Yoo Seonhwa.", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t sit right away.", "He hesitated while looking at the shopping bags in his left and right hands.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Hurry and sit.\u201d", "Noticing his hesitation, his mother urged him again with a gentle voice.", "\u201cHmph,\u201d Seol Jinhee snorted. But just as she was about to say something\u2014", "\u201cHey, what did you bring?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa beat her to the punch.", "\u201cHm? Ah, it\u2019s Mother\u2019s birthday, and\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYou brought sweet potato cake? It\u2019s handmade too. It must have been expensive\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu was a bit taken aback that Yoo Seonhwa was talking to him so nonchalantly.", "\u201cIt\u2019s better than the one I or Wooseok Oppa brought, and sweet potato cake is your favorite too\u2026. Mother, why don\u2019t we use Jihu\u2019s cake for the birthday song later?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. But jeez, he brought so many things. He could have come empty-handed\u2026\u201d", "\u201cEii, it\u2019s Mother\u2019s birthday. I can tell Jihu\u2019s spent a lot of effort picking these out.\u201d", "\u201cSo embarrassing\u2026 Anyway, give those here and take a seat. I\u2019ll go put the cake in the fridge.\u201d", "\u201cN-No, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tried to head to the kitchen, but he was stopped by his mother as she took the shopping bags from him.", "\u201cSit. We\u2019ve been starving waiting for you to come.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa tapped on the seat, and only then did Seol Jihu hesitantly sit down.", "The six people finally sat down around the dinner table.", "\u201cAh, I\u2019m starving. We can eat now that Jihu\u2019s here, right?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa said casually as an awkward silence filled the atmosphere.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s mother smiled brightly and nodded.", "\u201cOf course, go ahead. You too, Jihu.\u201d", "\u201cWow, you really pulled out your best recipes for Jihu. Everything looks amazing.\u201d", "Only when Yoo Seonhwa nonchalantly mentioned this did Seol Jihu see what was actually on the table.", "All sorts of delectable dishes were laid out on the table.", "They were all food that Seol Jihu loved.", "\u201cThanks for the food~\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa said in a bright voice and reached her chopsticks out.", "Yoo Seunghae, who kept stealing glances at Seol Jihu, also carefully picked up her utensils.", "Seol Wooseok also took a spoonful of soup, then grinned.", "\u201cThis is great. Having Jihu here really changes the flavor.\u201d", "\u201cWooseok, when did I\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIf only you showed off your skills normally. Hey, you should try some too. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok said casually. Thanks to him, the cold atmosphere seemed to melt bit by bit.", "Seol Jihu carefully picked up his spoon before pausing.", "A stinging gaze pierced his face.", "Seol Jinhee was glaring at him with an expressionless, spiteful gaze.", "Although her mouth was tightly shut, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t need to hear her out to know exactly what she was thinking.", "\u2018What qualification does someone like you have to eat Mom\u2019s food?\u2019 must be what she\u2019s thinking.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Recalling the highway rest area incident, Seol Jihu was about to place down his spoon, when\u2014", "\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Jinhee?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa said to Seol Jinhee.", "\u201cYou should eat, too. The food\u2019s going to go cold. You don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Unni.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s good! Why, are you feeling unwell? Do you want to go rest inside your room?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201d", "Seol Jinhee heaved a dumbfounded sigh.", "She took her eyes off Seol Jihu just barely, then picked up her chopsticks in a snatching motion.", "Yoo Seonhwa glanced at Seol Jihu fidgeting with his utensils before picking up a large, juicy piece of steamed short ribs.", "\u201cAnyway, aren\u2019t you being too adamant? I thought you\u2019d call me at least once.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThe offer I made. You know, about working at the cafe together. Eh, judging by that face, you must have forgotten all about it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked twice. He vaguely remembered Yoo Seonhwa making such an offer. He had forgotten about it because he had no interest in it.", "\u201cAh, I found myself with a large sum of extra money some time back because Jihu paid off his debts in one go.\u201d", "As everyone\u2019s gaze fell on Yoo Seonhwa, she explained as if it was nothing.", "\u201cI tried to coax him into running the business with me.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok looked shaken. Their mother was shocked, and Seol Jinhee was alarmed.", "\u201cU-Unni, are you serious? Are you crazy?\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa ignored her and continued.", "\u201cBut he declined right away.\u201d", "\u201cHe declined?\u201d", "\u201cYep. I thought he\u2019d take the bait if I waved it right in front of him, but he refused right away. I thought he was just acting proud and would call me back in a couple of days, but never mind calling, he didn\u2019t even text me.\u201d", "Their mother\u2019s complexion brightened.", "Seol Wooseok nodded his head in satisfaction, clearly thinking, \u2018I knew it. I was right.\u2019", "Seol Jihu looked at Yoo Seonhwa in a renewed way.", "He didn\u2019t expect this at all.", "He was prepared for the worst given all the horrible things he had done to Yoo Seonhwa, but for some reason, she was welcoming him.", "He could tell just by how she covered for him.", "\u201cYou must really like your current workplace.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa removed the bone from a piece of short rib, cut it in half, and placed one into her mouth and the other on Seol Jihu\u2019s plate.", "\u201c\u2026Yeah, it\u2019s hard, but fun. I\u2019m enjoying it there.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not good. If you enjoy working too much, you\u2019ll become a workaholic.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa smiled bitterly, then gestured at his bowl of rice.", "Encouraged by her consideration, Seol Jihu took a spoonful of rice. And when he placed the steaming rice into his mouth along with the well-cooked braised short rib, he closed his eyes unknowingly.", "\u2018It\u2019s delicious.\u2019", "Seol Jihu found the food delicious without even the slightest exaggeration.", "It had been so long since he had his mother\u2019s homemade food that he almost teared up.", "His pounding heart had also stopped.", "That wasn\u2019t all.", "\u201cOh yeah, how did you end up getting into Sinyoung?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, tell us a bit about it. I\u2019m sure Mother is dying to know as well.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa and Seol Wooseok talked to him constantly. Seol Jihu knew they were trying their best not to make the atmosphere awkward.", "Thanks to their show of goodwill, Seol Jihu opened up more and more.", "\u201cI just got to know them through work\u2026\u201d", "\u201cActually, what I want to know is how you know Director Yun Seohui and Manager Yun Seora.\u201d", "\u201cHuh? How does Hyung know Miss Yun Seora\u2026 or rather, Manager Yun?\u201d", "\u201cYou weren\u2019t picking up my calls at all, so I called your company and your manager picked up. She praised you like there was no tomorrow.\u201d", "\u201cShe did?\u201d", "\u201cYep. She was so excited when she was talking about you that I thought she was bragging about her own kid. She sent a card and a present for Mother\u2019s birthday too. Also, she said you saved her life? What does that mean?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026She said all that, huh.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head. He appreciated Yun Seora\u2019s compliments, but it seemed she said something unnecessary.", "Seol Wooseok observed Seol Jihu carefully, then asked.", "\u201cSpeaking of which, there are some things I heard through the grapevine\u2026 Do you have something big going on at work?\u201d", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "\u201cI know you\u2019re in Miss Yun Seora\u2019s team, but Miss Yun Seohui was pretty close to you too. I don\u2019t know the details, but I heard Sinyoung\u2019s inner structure is complex. Director Yun Seohui had everything under her grasp, but I also heard Manager Yun Seora is doing quite well recently.\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked. His older brother knew Sinyoung\u2019s inner hierarchy better than he thought.", "\u201cHow do you know all that?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m the manager of Haesol Research Institute. I hear news about people in the same line of work whether good or bad. Especially if it\u2019s a large corporation like Sinyoung.\u201d", "That made sense.", "But Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Seol Wooseok was probing him because he was also an Earthling.", "\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of this Yun Seohui person.\u201d", "At that moment, Yoo Seonhwa cut in.", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows.", "\u201cYou know her?\u201d", "\u201cNo, how would I know her?\u201d", "\u201cThen why do you say that?\u201d", "\u201cNo reason. I just don\u2019t like her name. But don\u2019t forget it. You know my intuition is pretty good, right?\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "Seol Jihu acknowledged it readily.", "\u201cStill, don\u2019t worry too much.\u201d", "\u201cOh? Where is this confidence coming from? Aren\u2019t you just an employee?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu spoke plainly, Seol Wooseok showed a hint of surprise.", "\u201cWell, to tell you the truth, that problem was a bit stressful in the beginning.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sure it was. Office politics are like that.\u201d", "\u201cI wasn\u2019t a fan of that. You know, other people forcing me to take a side when I just want to focus on my work.\u201d", "\u201cNot something you can control, is it?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s why I gritted my teeth and swore to get strong so as to avoid any underhanded schemes.\u201d", "\u201cOh? You\u2019re talking like you got yourself a strong backer.\u201d", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that\u2026 but I can just quit if things go wrong. There are plenty of people who want me.\u201d", "Seol Jihu muttered as he stuffed his mouth with a spoonful of rice.", "Talking while eating made the food all the more delicious.", "Their mother gently closed her eyes as she watched Seol Jihu, Seol Wooseok, and Yoo Seonhwa chat.", "She was indescribably moved.", "Just how long had she waited to see this scene once again?", "She felt like she returned to the happy days of the past.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "However, her jubilant mood died down when she saw the empty seat at the table.", "Soon, she got up quietly, making an excuse of going to the bathroom. She then opened the master bedroom door and went in.", "Inside, the father of the family was lying on the bed, watching TV.", "\u201cDear, are you really going to do this?\u201d", "She sat down on the corner of the bed and pleaded.", "\u201cJihu mustered up his courage to come. He\u2019s walking on eggshells because you\u2019re not there\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAt least come show your face and hear him out. Seonhwa said she offered to have her cafe be signed under both of their names and that he declined right away. The old Jihu would never have done such a thing.\u201d", "There was no reply.", "The father continued to watch TV with a stone-cold expression.", "\u201cHoney!\u201d", "\u201cLeave.\u201d", "He muttered gruffly in reply when the mother raised her voice.", "\u201cI\u2019m doing what you wanted, aren\u2019t I? You told me not to come out.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s because\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t wanna see that bastard\u2019s face either. Just seeing him drives me mad. What, you still want me to come out?\u201d", "He said curtly.", "\u201cI\u2019m only holding it in because it\u2019s your birthday and because Wooseok begged me when he never once made a request of me his entire life. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have let that bastard step one foot inside this house!\u201d", "\u201cDear\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m boiling with rage right now, but I\u2019m suppressing myself. If you understand that, don\u2019t ask me to come out. I feel like I\u2019m going to blow up every time I hear his voice.\u201d", "With that, he turned around and faced the wall.", "The mother tried talking to him a few more times, but he didn\u2019t even reply and only raised the volume of the TV.", "In the end, she sighed and left, quietly closing the door behind her.", "She returned to the dinner table with a troubled look on her face, then met Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes.", "She quickly put on a smile.", "\u201cYou\u2019re eating well. Doesn\u2019t Sinyoung feed you?\u201d", "\u201cN-No, I eat every meal. I guess your food is still the best.\u201d", "\u201cHaha, do you want more?\u201d", "She took Seol Jihu\u2019s bowl without even waiting for a response and filled it with rice until it formed a small mound.", "It was a lot, but Seol Jihu didn\u2019t refuse. He felt like he could eat however much he wanted because the food was better than anything he had in Paradise.", "It was then.", "\u201cMom, do you hear these squeaks?\u201d", "Seol Jinhee asked, taking advantage of a brief lull in their conversation.", "\u201cSqueaks? You mean like a mouse\u2019s?\u201d", "\u201cYep, I think there\u2019s a rat stealing our food.\u201d", "She spoke as if she had been waiting wholeheartedly for this moment.", "Seol Jihu paused.", "The atmosphere suddenly froze.", "Though she didn\u2019t say it outright, everyone knew who she was referring to.", "Seol Jinhee raised the corner of her mouth. She had been gritting her teeth looking for an opportunity to cut in, but couldn\u2019t because of Yoo Seonhwa and Seol Wooseok constantly talking to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve eaten enough, so why don\u2019t you go back? Way to be so tactless. I don\u2019t know what I expected from a rat.\u201d", "\u201cJinhee.\u201d", "\u201cWhere\u2019d you lose your conscience? On one of your thieving sprees? I\u2019m surprised you can swallow all that food. I guess you\u2019ve forgotten about all the shit you\u2019ve pulled.\u201d", "\u201cJinhee!\u201d", "Their mother shouted.", "\u201cSeol Jinhee.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok\u2019s voice also turned cold.", "Seol Jinhee twisted her mouth defiantly. Giving a sidelong scowl at Seol Jihu, she turned to Yoo Seonhwa and raised her voice.", "\u201cOh yeah, Unni! What happened with that?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about. I introduced you to a guy last time, remember?\u201d", "Seol Jinhee smiled.", "\u201cIt\u2019s about time you get yourself a man.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThat Oppa is super famous in my department. He was the campus model! His face and figure are top-notch, his personality is great, and he\u2019s from a wealthy family. He wasn\u2019t interested in other women, but when I showed him one of your pictures, it was love at first sight for him\u2014\u201d", "\u201cHey.\u201d", "Tak. The sound of chopsticks hitting the table rang out.", "Seol Jinhee trailed off before she could finish saying, \u2018He begged me sooo much~\u2019", "Yoo Seonhwa was staring at her with an expressionless face.", "Seol Jinhee knew Yoo Seonhwa well enough to know that this was what she did when she was angry.", "\u201c\u2026Yeah, you did introduce him to me. Without me ever asking for such a thing.\u201d", "Her voice was cold.", "\u201cI clearly rejected him, saying I didn\u2019t have the time to be dating because I was busy with opening my cafe. But you gave that psycho son of a bitch my cafe address as well.\u201d", "\u201cUn-Unni.\u201d", "\u201cThen he actually came to the cafe and asked to see me, giving your name as reference. I told him there was a misunderstanding and told him to go back, but then he freaked the hell out and threw a fit, so I had to call the cops on him. I thought I already told you.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I mean\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYou apologized to me multiple times for that incident. Saying you didn\u2019t know he was like that. You also said you\u2019d never do it again, remember?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cYou and I both know this, and it should be a thing of the past, so why are you suddenly bringing it up?\u201d", "Seol Jinhee became lost for words. To be completely honest, she was trying to provoke Seol Jihu, knowing how much head-over-heels he was for Yoo Seonhwa, but Yoo Seonhwa\u2019s reaction was slightly different than what she was expecting.", "\u201cYou\u2019re obviously trying to provoke Jihu or make him uncomfortable. But that\u2019s the best you could come up with?\u201d", "Seol Jinhee frowned as Yoo Seonhwa exposed her intent in a sharp tone.", "\u201cDo you have to put it that way, Unni?\u201d", "\u201cWhy? Am I wrong?\u201d", "\u201cUnni\u2026 Are you fine with this? Why are you doing this? Are you two back together or something?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not something for you to worry about.\u201d", "Yoo Seonhwa replied coldly.", "\u201cI understand that you\u2019re angry. Then you should talk to Jihu afterward. What are you doing at your mother\u2019s birthday celebration? Don\u2019t you see her face? Have you thought about her feelings?\u201d", "\u201cUnni!\u201d", "\u201cBe quiet.
