Outside!]", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Unexpectedly obtaining something he had to bring along everywhere, Seol Jihu turned back feeling strange.", "The travel back home was smooth, except for one troublesome situation he ran into. As he was in the southernmost region renowned for being unsafe, he should have had a difficult journey.", "Traveling alone made one an easy prey, and as monsters generally enjoyed the taste of human flesh, they wouldn\u2019t let a delicacy escape so easily.", "As a result, a group of seven monsters had commenced their hunt while swallowing their saliva, and it wasn\u2019t until half of them were steamed cold by Seol Jihu\u2019s Ice Spear that they ran for their lives.", "The problem was that the ones who managed to escape informed the deaths of their comrades to their village.", "It would have been better if they just stayed quiet, but the leader of the monsters grew furious at the deaths of its subordinates and swore a vendetta against the perpetrator.", "No matter how strong the human was, he was alone. If the entire clan ambushed him while he was asleep at night, his demise seemed inevitable.", "Thinking so, the leader became confident in its plans.", "That was, of course, until it got beaten to a pulp.", "If there was one mistake it made, it was that it didn\u2019t realize the human wasn\u2019t alone. And if one were to put a second charge to its list of crimes, it would be that it disrupted Flone\u2019s secret enjoyment.", "She was giggling and taking delight in watching Seol Jihu\u2019s sleeping face, but when sharp killing intent swept over his campsite, Seol Jihu had instantly opened his eyes.", "When his and Flone\u2019s eyes met at a nose-close distance, Flone felt extremely embarrassed, and this humiliation transformed into unreasonable rage.", "In the end, the pack of monsters that caused this situation faced Flone\u2019s rage in full force.", "Not only did she beat the warriors of the pack into a pulp, but she even tore the trembling mothers and babies hugging each other into pieces. Seeing this, Seol Jihu became speechless.", "An unexpected consequence of this massacre was freeing the few Earthlings who were being kept in the monsters\u2019 village as if they were livestock, but the two of them had no way of knowing this.", "In any case, Seol Jihu returned to Haramark safe and sound and headed straight to Carpe Diem\u2019s office.", "The three others must have gone out as the building was empty.", "[Is this your room?]", "When he returned to his room, the pendant floated up and moved side to side.", "[Can I look around?]", "\u201cSure.\u201d", "Immediately, black smoke flowed out from the gem and flew around the room.", "For the record, Seol Jihu called this gaseous state of Flone as \u2018stage 1\u2019.", "[Bed!]", "Next, the smoke blazed up and transformed into a half-transparent figure of Flone. This ghost form that was invisible to Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes was \u2018stage 2\u2019.", "\u2018Stage 3\u2019 was when she manifested, being no longer half-transparent and visible to everyone else.", "[Wow, wow!]", "Seol Jihu made a bitter smile as he watched Flone roll around in his bed.", "\u2018I was too hasty again.\u2019", "He thought Flone would be freed if the barrier and the spell tying her to the Forest of Denial were lifted. In a way, he wasn\u2019t wrong. After all, Flone had been freed.", "The problem was that Seol Jihu equated freedom to entering the afterlife.", "To be more precise, when she became an evil spirit from resentment, she became a type of haunting spirit. Simply put, she hadn\u2019t given up on revenge and was refusing to move on to the afterlife.", "\u2018I really made a fool out of myself.\u2019", "Flone repeatedly asking \u2018What do I do?\u2019 and putting the pendant around his neck was just a way of telling him to bring her with him.", "He\u2019d shouted \u2018Goodbye!\u2019 without even knowing that. Just how comical did he look?", "When the barrier and the spell tying her down vanished, she had lost the place she haunted, making the pendant she cherished her new home. Now, she was hanging on Seol Jihu\u2019s neck, enjoying the freedom to her fullest.", "[Can I go out and play?]", "Seol Jihu smiled faintly. As long as he had the pendant, there was nothing to worry about.", "Being outside the Forest of Denial for the first time in centuries, Flone was as curious as a child, always disappearing on her own to take a look around and coming back to the pendant to sleep.", "\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d", "[On a stroll. I want to check out the city.]", "\u201cYou know you can\u2019t let other people see you, right?\u201d", "[Yep.]", "Flone became half-transparent again and passed through the window.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t randomly kill someone, okay?\u201d", "[Okay!]", "Seeing Flone fly away in the blink of an eye, Seol Jihu plopped down on the bed before sprawling down on his back and looking up at the ceiling.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "To be honest, he was still a bit embarrassed. The Ghost Saintess not passing on to the afterlife was an unexpected result, but he didn\u2019t think traveling together like this was bad.", "There were other reasons too, but he was happy that Flone herself wanted to stay in Paradise.", "\u2018Who would have thought I would get a ghost friend?\u2019", "Seol Jihu closed his eyes, thinking how unpredictable life was.", "**", "Making a report after returning from an expedition or an exploration was a \u2018must\u2019. One could find out about this just by seeing how Alex reported the appearance of the Moles to the Temple as soon as he returned to Haramark, and had the information appear in the plaza.", "Paradise\u2019s ecosystem being disrupted was a frequent occurrence. Continuous sharing and updating of information was practically an unspoken rule in Paradise.", "After all, just knowing \u2018Monster A appeared in Region B\u2019 greatly increased one\u2019s chance of survival.", "This was also the reason the Haramark Royal Magician invited Seol Jihu. Ian had requested him to help him with his report on the fifth Banquet.", "Although he\u2019d heard the story at the pub before, there was a huge difference between listening while drunk and listening as a serious business.", "The Royal Magician\u2019s private library was stacked full of books. Ian sat in front of a desk, spinning a fountain pen between his fingers. Seol Jihu was slightly taken aback by this side of Ian, which was different from his usual flippant attitude.", "Seol Jihu readily agreed to Ian\u2019s request, hoping to see Princess Teresa and give her a gift while he was at it. However, Princess Teresa was out.", "According to Ian, she was working hard at Arden Valley with the village head of Ramman Village. When Seol Jihu heard that the village head\u2019s knowledge greatly bolstered the plan of fortifying Arden Valley, he felt content.", "While helping Ian get the story of the Banquet straight, Seol Jihu also told him the reason the Ghost Saintess was angry. When Ian said, \u201cShe could have just asked why you weren\u2019t there. What a narrow-minded Saintess,\u201d Seol Jihu jumped up in shock.", "He had to expend quite a bit of effort to stop Flone, who was struggling wildly and yelling that she would pull the old man\u2019s beard out.", "He consoled Flone by taking her to a lake at the center of the capital, then barely sent her off by telling her how beautiful she was.", "By the time Seol Jihu was almost finished with going over the report, Ian who was silently focused on the report suddenly asked.", "\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Me?\u201d", "\u201cWhen you came back, your face was full of worry.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed lightly.", "\u201cI am always worried.\u201d", "\u201cAiya, it\u2019s like they say. A tree with many branches is always concerned about the wind. What are you worried about now?\u201d", "\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m not sure.\u201d", "Seol Jihu pulled his arm back and rubbed his neck.", "\u201cWhat I should do\u2026 where I should begin\u2026 I\u2019m just not sure.\u201d", "\u201cHm.\u201d", "Ian asked, not taking his eyes off the report.", "\u201cNow that I think about it, aren\u2019t you still Level 3?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cSince you passed Stage 3, you should be able to get to Level 4.\u201d", "\u201cProbably.\u201d", "\u201cHoh, I\u2019m also Level 4. To think we\u2019re already at the same level\u2026.\u201d", "Ian shook his head.", "\u201cCan\u2019t you become a High Ranker if you want, Master Ian?\u201d", "\u201cI haven\u2019t been Enlightened yet, and even if I were, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that your growth speed is incredible. Well, considering the things you\u2019ve done, it\u2019s no surprise.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s explosive rate of growth was explained by the impossibly difficult missions he\u2019s completed since he was a Level 1.", "\u201cAnyways, a Level 4\u2026. I guess it is time to get ready.\u201d", "Ian took a deep breath and nodded his head. After staring at the report for a long time\u2026.", "\u201cThere is this saying.\u201d", "He opened his mouth.", "\u201cHe who wishes to wear the crown, must bear its weight.\u201d", "Hearing the word \u2018crown\u2019, Seol Jihu flinched.", "First Kazuki, and now Ian. Was he that easy to see through?", "\u201cI think you want to become the leader of Carpe Diem. Am I right?\u201d", "When he asked to confirm, Seol Jihu nodded his head.", "\u201cThen do you know the difference between a leader and a member? What do you think is the most important virtue a leader must have?\u201d", "\u201cEyes that can read the situation, no?\u201d", "\u201cIf it were that obvious, I wouldn\u2019t have asked, don\u2019t you think?\u201d", "Seol Jihu fell into thought for a moment before replying.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s strength.\u201d", "\u201cStrength? Don\u2019t tell me you mean physical strength?\u201d", "\u201cRather than being the physical strength of the leader\u2026 I would say it\u2019s the physical strength of the group.\u201d", "Ian tilted his head and slowly rubbed his beard.", "\u201cThat\u2019s too broad. In my opinion, a leader has to be someone with diplomatic skills.\u201d", "\u201cDiplomatic skills?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. More than ten years have passed in Paradise\u2019s time since it began to invite Earthlings. There are countless for-profit groups and organizations co-existing in this world for various goals.\u201d", "\"\u2026.\"", "\u201cTo survive in these rough waters, diplomacy is key. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d", "Seeing Seol Jihu only tilt his head at this question, Ian smacked his lips.", "\u201cMm\u2026. What is the goal of the team you are trying to create?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu opened his mouth to talk, Ian quickly asked again.", "\u201cAnd how will you create that team? How many members are you thinking of having? What will be the requirements to join? Do you have a recruiting strategy in mind?\u201d", "Seol Jihu listened attentively as his complexion slowly paled.", "\u201cYou probably never thought about the matter in detail. After all, I doubt you told anyone about it until now.\u201d", "Ian let out a big sigh.", "\u201cThe goal of a team is certainly important because it decides the color and personality of a team. But you cannot stop at just thinking about it. You have to say it and put it into action. Only then can you add meat and scent to your team.\u201d", "\u201cRight.\u201d", "\u201cIn Dylan\u2019s case, his actions were befitting of the name Carpe Diem. Since it means to enjoy the moment, there was no problem working as a small team of elites. But your goals aren\u2019t the same as Carpe Diem\u2019s.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded as he rubbed his face.", "\u201cI understand what you\u2019re feeling. The bigger your goals are, the bigger burden you must face. Even I am not confident in accomplishing what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d", "Ian chuckled while clicking his tongue.", "\u201cBecause of the sheer difficulty of your goals, your team must inevitably rise beyond to become an organization. And on your path to becoming a large organization, your diplomatic skills will be tested multiple times.\u201d", "\u201cBy diplomatic skills, you don\u2019t just mean relationships between groups\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOf course. It also includes relationships between individuals. Frankly speaking, if a stranger suddenly came up and said, \u2018Hello! Let\u2019s save Paradise from its peril!\u2019, will you answer, \u2018Sure! Let\u2019s do it!\u2019?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026No.\u201d", "\u201cExactly. Of course, some people might work for a righteous cause. But most people won\u2019t make a move based on righteousness alone. How righteous you are won\u2019t matter.\u201d", "Ian then added with a bitter tone, \u201cThe Haramark Royal Family isn\u2019t generous with rewards because they\u2019re pushovers.\u201d", "\u201cThen what should I do?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s obvious. Money, fame, and\u2026.\u201d", "Ian paused before breaking out into a grin.", "\u201cWit.\u201d", "\u201cWit?\u201d", "\u201cAppeasing a soul with a Ceremony, baiting the Parasites in Arden Valley, coming up with a plan to escape the laboratory\u2026 it\u2019s wittiness that made these things possible. This ability of yours transcends materialistic things. I think it will become a charm that only you possess.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating it.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t deny it. After all, I\u2019m one of the people who\u2019s fallen head over heels for this charm.\u201d", "Seol Jihu scratched his cheek, feeling a bit itchy.", "\u201cIn the future, a lot will change.\u201d", "Ian let out a long sigh once again.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll have to change the name, and if needed, you might have to move your base of operations. You might have to reaffirm your alliances, and you might even have to change your teammates completely\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cChohong and Hugo, you mean?\u201d", "Ian\u2019s pen stopped. He glanced up and spoke calmly.", "\u201cThose two are members of Carpe Diem, which Dylan made.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if they will agree to follow you.\u201d", "\u201cIf they don\u2019t\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cThen it\u2019s simple.\u201d", "Ian spoke clearly.", "\u201cEither you will leave the team, or they will.\u201d", "Seol Jihu leaned back against the chair and tilted his chin up. He felt dizzy staring at the high ceiling.", "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty difficult, huh.\u201d", "Hearing Seol Jihu\u2019s groan, Ian smirked.", "\u201cSo, what. You\u2019re going to quit?\u201d", "Seol Jihu snickered too. Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to say thanks.", "\u201cThank you. You always give me advice worth more than gold.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m happy you think my nonsense is worth so much. I\u2019m flattered.\u201d", "Ian burst out into laughter as he put his pen down. Then, his eyes flickered as he looked at the equipment lying on the table.", "\u201cGreat, why don\u2019t I give one homework for our future leader?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThis.\u201d", "Ian picked up the longsword and the shield. They were the burial goods Seol Jihu brought from the tomb. As these were equipment from the era of the Empire, they would fetch an astronomical price if sold.", "\u201cExcellent. You told me to give this to them\u2026.\u201d", "Ian expressed his awe before putting the sword and shield back down.", "\u201cBut give these to them yourself the next time you see them. Except, you will add conditions.\u201d", "\u201cConditions\u2026. You mean I should trade them?\u201d", "\u201cExactly. Equivalent exchange. You see, giving these away for free would be too much. I don\u2019t mind whether you do it for yourself or for others, so give this diplomacy thing a chance.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2014 No, okay.\u201d", "Seol Jihu swallowed the words that were just about to come out of his mouth and obediently nodded his head. To be honest, he was feeling greatly indebted to Teresa, but there had to be a reason Ian gave him this homework.", "\u201cGood. Ah, you can go now. I finished going over all the details.\u201d", "\u201cGot it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu got up from his seat.", "\u201cSeol.\u201d", "Just as he was about to open the door and leave, Ian added.", "\u201cA leader is not someone who is placed in that position by someone else. A leader is someone who wishes to become a leader himself.\u201d", "Hearing Ian\u2019s affirming tone, Seol Jihu nodded his head. Ian giggled.", "\u201cDon\u2019t make Maldong worry too much. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s steaming right now with restlessness.\u201d", "\u201cGot it. Thank you for your kind words.\u201d", "Seol Jihu bowed before leaving.", "When the sound of the door closing rang out, Ian put his pipe back into his mouth and took up his fountain pen. Puffing out one smoke after the other, he stared at the report fixedly.", "As this report could be a matter of life or death for someone, there was nothing wrong with reviewing it multiple times.", "\u300e\u2026And thus, just when the catastrophe of the fourth Banquet was about to repeat itself, one young man stepped up.", "The protagonist who normalized the trouble-ridden fifth Banquet was Carpe Diem\u2019s Seol Jihu (Korea)\u2026.\u300f", "While reading about the events of Stage 2, Ian smiled.", "He grabbed his pen tightly and, without hesitation, scratched out the words \u2018Carpe Diem\u2019.", "**", "Seol Jihu walked while looking down at the ground, his footsteps heavy. He was walking out of the palace\u2019s main gate, but he was so deep in thought that he didn\u2019t even notice it.", "Although he had expected as much, now that he was faced with the problem, he realized how impossibly difficult and complicated it was to become a leader.", "Moreover, just as Ian said, the number of things he had to worry about increased, the bigger he set his goals. The weight of it all seemed to crush down on his shoulders.", "It was to the point that he began to admire Dylan.", "\u2018Money\u2026.\u2019", "All sorts of thoughts swirled inside his head, but money was at the focus of it all. If he had an astronomical amount of money, he felt like he would have more choices as well.", "Then suddenly, he recalled Stage 3.", "\u2018I should have brought it.\u2019", "And he thought about the Dissonant Wishes the deceased carried with them.", "At the very least, they would have been worth a gold coin.", "Although he regretted it, the bus had already left.", "\u2018It\u2019s no time to sit still.\u2019", "He couldn\u2019t stand around in a daze just because a big event had ended. There were just too many things he needed to take care of.", "When he set his resolve, his steps naturally quickened. Soon, he found himself at Carpe Diem\u2019s office.", "One of Seol Jihu\u2019s habits was to first take care of the most difficult and time-consuming things. As soon as he entered his room, he took out his communication crystal and infused his mana into it.", "\u2014Oh? It\u2019s been a while.", "Along with a familiar voice, Kim Hannah appeared on the crystal.", "\u2014You\u2019re contacting me now after the Banquet ended?", "\u201cThere was something I had to take care of, so I was a bit late.\u201d", "\u2014Hnng, okay. Anyways, I heard you caused another big stir.", "\u201cI did. Anyhow, let\u2019s talk about the Banquet later.\u201d", "\u2014\u2026Huh?", "Kim Hannah blinked her smiling eyes.", "\u201cI need to ask you for a favor.\u201d", "\u2014Favor? You\u2019re out of money? I can send you some if you want.", "\u201cSure, but the favor is something else.\u201d", "Kim Hannah must have felt that something was off as she straightened her tilted chair and sat up straight.", "\u2014What\u2019s gotten into you? Being so serious\u2026. I\u2019m not used to this. Anyways, go on. What is it?", "\u201cI want you to help me find someone.\u201d", "One of Kim Hannah\u2019s eyes perked up.", "\u2014Who?", "\u201cCan you do it?\u201d", "\u2014I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t. Finding and observing someone are my specialties.", "As expected of a woman who became a High Ranker with just the ability of a broker, her businesslike voice was filled with pride.", "\u2014I want to ask why\u2026.", "Kim Hannah muttered hintingly, then asked while she tapped on her desk with her index finger.", "\u2014But I\u2019ll hear you out first. Who is it?", "\u201cThere are two people, actually.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke calmly.", "\u201cA brother and sister duo. Their names are\u2026.\u201d"]}
