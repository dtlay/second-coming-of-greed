Variable, and Variable (4)", "content": ["The view of the territory that the Parasite Queen had settled in was similar to what he had seen in the Delphinion Duchy.", "But there was a difference.", "How should he put it? Seol Jihu felt the urge to get out of here as soon as possible.", "It began the moment he first set foot on the rotting soil.", "He could feel his energy drain and his strength weaken when all he did was stand there. His headache worsened and his physical condition deteriorated with every breath. On top of that, the world looked dark and dreary, even though the sun was clearly out and shining.", "This seemed to be the case for the rest of the team as well, as looks of discomfort crossed their faces.", "The surrounding landscape flashed past them.", "It would take them at least six hours to reach their destination on foot, but fortunately, they had the means to fly.", "The expedition team was able to arrive near its destination about 40 minutes after leaving their hideout.", "\u201cOver there.\u201d", "The team had entered a vast mountain terrain, where the ground had risen to an altitude of more than 2000 meters above sea level, forming a series of steep slopes.", "In the direction that Baek Haeju pointed stood a faded building that almost seemed glued to the mountain range.", "Standing alone at this high altitude, the building almost seemed to be out of touch with the world.", "[It\u2019s the Castitas Monastery!]", "Flone, who was flying after the phoenix carrying Seol Jihu in her arms, gave a small exclamation.", "\u201cMonastery?\u201d", "[Yeah. It\u2019s where the priests who served the Goddess of Chastity practiced their faith, away from the rest of the world.]", "Flone quickly explained and tilted her head.", "[But\u2026 that\u2019s strange. That monastery doesn\u2019t have any secret hiding place as far as I know. Of course, it\u2019s considered sacred, but I don\u2019t think the Gorgonu would have cared about that\u2026.]", "She was right. It was hard to imagine anyone would hide anything in a place as wide open as that monastery building.", "[But I was never the family head, so I don\u2019t know of every family secret, but\u2026. Ah!]", "Flone quickly descended behind the phoenix, who suddenly changed his altitude after passing by the monastery.", "The phoenix did not stop flapping his wings for a long time even after it began to fly low.", "\u2018Further, further\u2026.\u2019 Baek Haeju kept muttering and stopped only after they had passed a dozen mountains.", "\u201cStop. Please descend here.\u201d", "The phoenix and Flone landed almost simultaneously.", "Baek Haeju jumped off the phoenix and began climbing the rugged slope.", "She took the lead and escorted the team to a place where the blankets of clouds were unusually thick, to the point they couldn\u2019t even see an inch in front of them.", "\u201cFrom this point onward, we\u2019ll walk in a single file. Follow me, and don\u2019t stray from the path, or else you might fall.\u201d", "The expedition team quickly changed its formation and began the march.", "They picked their way through the clouds, taking each step with caution. Then, all of a sudden, the clouds lifted, the view widened and their vision became crystal clear.", "The next thing they saw was a steep cliff. Enthralled by the beauty of the landscape, Seol Jihu realized a moment later that a cave was hidden behind the cliff.", "When he came to his senses, Baek Haeju was already entering the cave.", "The team hurried after her, but all they could see inside was darkness.", "Only after Philip Muller recited the illumination spell were they able to see the seemingly endless flight of stone steps leading down to the area below.", "\u201cI have a bad feeling about this. Are you sure there are no traps?\u201d", "Phi Sora asked in a wary voice as she marched down the uneven stairs.", "\u201cI took care of them the last time I was here.\u201d", "Baek Haeju, who had already descended the stairs, replied while pushing the iron gate at the end of the stairs.", "As they had been warned, the inside was deep and complex.", "The slope wasn\u2019t steep but it was long and the road kept branching off into more paths, much like a maze.", "In spite of everything, however, Baek Haeju continued down the road without any hesitation, perhaps because she had been here once before.", "She walked straight ahead for a while before entering the gate at the far left end, at a spot where the road branched in seven directions.", "Then, at the next crossroads, she turned right.", "Baek Haeju continued to move in a clockwise direction and stopped after seven full circles.", "The space where the expedition team arrived was a void with nothing but a tunnel, the size of which an adult could barely pass through.", "\u201cThis room is the deepest part of the catacombs.\u201d", "Baek Haeju took out the Rothschear\u2019s insignia from her Dimensional Pocket and looked back at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go alone from here. Only those permitted by the guardian can find the right path.\u201d", "\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d", "\u201cNot long, since all I\u2019ll be doing is bringing it with me. I\u2019ll be out in three minutes at the earliest, five minutes at the latest.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded.", "He, too, had Rothschear\u2019s insignia and wondered which world the tunnel was connected to, but he held back his curiosity.", "The insignia was no guarantee that he was qualified, and this was no time to put his personal desires before their goal.", "\u201cWe\u2019re counting on you.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll try to be as quick as possible.\u201d", "Baek Haeju turned towards the tunnel with the insignia in her hand.", "Her body faded as soon as she stepped inside the tunnel where the strange mana danced.", "It was like watching someone use the warp gate\u2019s portal.", "With Baek Haeju gone, an awkward silence filled the air.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad we made it here in one piece.\u201d", "Disconcerted by the heavy silence, Phi Sora said in a cheerful voice.", "\u201c\u2026News just came in.\u201d", "At that moment, White Tiger, holding a communication crystal in his hand, announced in a low voice.", "\u201cThe Parasite Queen and Unsightly Humility\u2019s army have withdrawn from the Hiral Mountain Range.\u201d", "\u201cEek\u2014\u201d", "Phi Sora yelped.", "\u201cLooks like they left in a hurry as if they were being chased by something. Like that time they lost in Tigol Fortress and ran away without looking back.\u201d", "White Tiger flashed his fangs in a smile.", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied calmly.", "It wasn't good news, but it was the way things should be.", "The Parasite Queen wouldn\u2019t sit idly while her enemies roamed freely in her domain.", "As the entire imperial territory was under her surveillance, he would have been more suspicious if she hadn\u2019t left.", "So this move of hers was within his expectations, but nevertheless he couldn\u2019t help feeling pressured.", "\u201cWe should contact the hideout and see how they\u2019re doing.\u201d", "\u201cI already did.\u201d", "Said Philip Muller when he saw Seol Jihu pull out a communication crystal.", "\u201cWhen?\u201d", "\u201cBefore we discovered the mountain range. They said nothing\u2019s out of the ordinary.\u201d", "That was good news if it was true.", "Seol Jihu glanced at the tunnel, wondering how much longer it would take.", "It was then.", "Suddenly, an eerie aura filled the tunnel and a woman dressed in white traditional robe rushed out.", "It was Baek Haeju.", "\u201cI got it.\u201d", "She held out her hand, covered in green mana.", "In her grasp was the stele surrounded in black smoke.", "\u201cHurry\u2026.\u201d", "Judging by her heavy breathing, she seemed to have run as fast as she could.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face trembled as he stared at the stele.", "He\u2019d never felt such boundless, purely evil energy before.", "But there wasn\u2019t much time for an examination.", "Seo Yuhui wrapped the stele in several layers of blessed cloth soaked in holy water, which she had prepared beforehand.", "The unsettling energy began to fade before disappearing completely.", "\u201cIt should be alright for now. The effect will last for a few days\u2026.\u201d", "At last, they succeeded in securing the stele.", "They had no more business here.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "The expedition team quickly escaped the catacombs and went back the way it had come.", "*", "30 minutes ago.", "Sung Shihyun sat on the parapet of the castle, watching the city below.", "Every day, a new Sinyoung executive was brought here and forced to apologize, and this made for a quite entertaining show.", "These men had to apologize with action, not with words.", "In other words, they were forced to undergo the same humiliation that Roe Scheherazade had suffered at their hands.", "For example, they had to dance naked, crawl on their knees with leashes around their necks, stand still for days without access to the bathroom, or even be raped in front of a crowd.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would really do it\u2026.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun mumbled as he watched one of the former executives howl in despair.", "\u201cThis is fun.\u201d", "As Roe Scheherazade giggled with joy, Sung Shihyun threw a sideways glance in her direction.", "\u201cYou won't change your mind now, will you?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade\u2019s eyes curved in a smile.", "\u201cEven if I do change my mind, I thought my part was already over?\u201d", "\u201cNo, we may have to use you again to locate another stele.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun smirked.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure the other Army Commanders will be delighted if we can take out the stele from Gorad Boga, but\u2026 I won\u2019t allow that.\u201d", "\u201cOh my. How come?\u201d", "\"So that everyone can focus on the task at hand. This mission has only one goal.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun continued.", "\u201cI don\u2019t need the stele or anything else. That bastard, he\u2019s all I\u2019m after.\u201d", "Roe Scheherazade looked at him with a renewed expression.", "Because even though his voice sounded calm, his eyes were filled with obsession and madness.", "At that moment, a succubus rushed in and whispered something in Sung Shihyun\u2019s ear.", "\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d", "\u201cYes, just now\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cHmph. It\u2019s still a bit early, but I guess l have to go.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun rose from his seat, turned and headed down the ramp.", "Roe Scheherazade tilted her head and followed him with a gentle gait.", "The place where Sung Shihyun headed to, was a room inside Gorad Boga where pieces of the stele were stored.", "The other four Army Commanders had already arrived before him.", "\u201cThe Queen called?\u201d", "\u2014You\u2019re here.", "As soon as Sung Shihyun asked, a grand voice resounded throughout the room.", "Twisted Kindness handed him the communication crystal in her hand.", "Sung Shihyun took it and smirked.", "\u201cCommunication crystals aren't too bad, huh? Your Majesty.\u201d", "\u2014It\u2019s primitive but somehow convenient.

How would you like to proceed from here?\u201d", "With a grin, he asked the queen on the other side of the crystal.", "\u201cAre you going to be greedy again and try to catch two rabbits at once, only to miss both of them and regret it, then say something like, \u2018Ah~ I should have gotten rid of the Brightest Star earlier~\u2019 Or\u2014\u201d", "\u2014You never change.", "The Parasite Queen gave a light chuckle.", "\u2014Didn\u2019t I tell you?
