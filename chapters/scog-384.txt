So he could guess how passionate they must have been in attacking the Temple of Luxuria, which must have been flaunting its political power.", "\u201cThe Temple of Luxuria\u2019s influence diminished by the day. Still, with how rare healing Priests were, there was a constant demand for their members, so they were able to maintain a certain level of influence. But they must have wanted to regain their past influence, which went above the Magicians\u2019 Guild, or maybe they felt threatened by the pressure from their surroundings\u2014 regardless, after Miss Seo Yuhui retired, the bishop, who was the representative of the Temple of Luxuria, made a certain decision.\u201d", "\u201cDecision?\u201d", "\u201cHe joined hands with Sinyoung.\u201d", "Kim Hannah said firmly.", "\u201cAha.\u201d", "Seol Jihu exclaimed.", "\u201cNow that you mention it, you used to be with Sinyoung.\u201d", "\u201cYou overhear interesting stories while following board members.

There might be something only she knows about as well.\u201d", "Kim Hannah continued.", "\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think Roberto Servillo made the wrong decision.

It is the runner-ups who are antsy to get ahead.\u201d", "Seol Jihu rubbed his chin slowly.", "He understood the background story to an extent.", "The bishop, who did not want Seo Yuhui\u2019s return more than anyone else, had come to help her personally. It was indeed strange.", "\u201cAnd there is something else I have to tell you.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke.", "\u201cWe ran into the bishop once while we were guarding Miss Seo Yuhui.
