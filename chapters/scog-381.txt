{"cid": "381", "title": "Chapter 381. Spring, the Season That Flowers Bloom (3)", "content": ["Seol Jihu came back.", "The position of Valhalla\u2019s representative, which had been empty for eight months, was filled once again.", "This news was immediately delivered to all members, including those working outside the building.", "As a result, Seol Jihu was quickly surrounded by his comrades, who came running from downstairs after hearing the news.", "\u201cHe\u2019s back! Seol is back!\u201d", "Hugo picked Seol Jihu up and rejoiced like a kid.", "\u201cIya~ Look at your shoulder and back muscles. Did you go and get steroids for eight months?\u201d", "Chohong expressed her awe while constantly rubbing and fondling Seol Jihu\u2019s wide, hard back.", "\u201cWelcome back, Representative.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea greeted him with his usual monotonous voice.", "\u201cOppa~ Sorry to ask you when you just got here, but can you lend me some money? It\u2019s kind of urgent.\u201d", "Maria put her hands out while asking in a nasal voice.", "\u201cCome ooonnn! If you came back, you should have gone around and said something! It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve been gone a month or two. It\u2019s been eight whole months!\u201d", "Phi Sora was still complaining.", "The quiet building quickly became noisy.", "Seol Jihu quietly smiled inside all the ruckus and looked around.", "He had been longing for this scenery for seven years.", "The loneliness he felt after Black Seol Jihu left seemed to subside slightly.", "Where have you been, did you get stronger, do you have any money on you? Seol Jihu answered the never-ending questions one by one.", "\u201cHow can you say, have you eaten?, so nonchalantly!? Shouldn\u2019t it be, have you been well? I almost got fooled!\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes met the grumbling Phi Sora\u2019s.", "He suddenly put down his silverware and winked at her.", "Phi Sora stopped talking with a flustered expression.", "Jang Maldong, who was standing back and watching the warm reunion with a smile, cleared his throat after seeing Seol Jihu eyeing him.", "\u201cWhat are y\u2019all doing so early in the morning?\u201d", "\u201cHaah? Can\u2019t you see? Seol\u2019s back, so we\u2019re saying hi. Isn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d", "\u201cWell, keep it to a minimum. Can\u2019t you see that you forced him to put his silverware down? Even a dog wouldn\u2019t bother someone who\u2019s eating.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re just curious! Aren\u2019t you curious too, old man?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t talk back to me. You can say your hellos later. Can\u2019t you see that he\u2019s eating after coming back early in the morning? Look at the shadows under his eyes! Throw him a warm welcoming party in the evening and let him be for now.\u201d", "\u201cAh, now that you mention it, he does seem a little tired.\u201d", "Chohong was quickly convinced by Jang Maldong.", "\u201cRight, and welcoming parties need alcohol! Seol, you better come tonight! Hugo, Maria, follow me.\u201d", "\u201cYeess! Tonight, we drink \u2018til we die!!\u201d", "\u201cSure~\u201d", "As Chohong began to rush downstairs, Hugo followed after her jubilantly. Maria responded in a lukewarm manner and went after them as well.", "The trio, who couldn\u2019t live without alcohol, left.", "\u2018It\u2019s not even noon. Just how much are they planning to buy?\u2019", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly.", "With the three loudest members leaving, the cafeteria quickly regained its serenity.", "Only Jang Maldong and Phi Sora were left talking to him.", "\u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t mind it all that much, but I guess it was a little uncomfortable because it\u2019s been a while.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said with a smile.", "\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I see them every day and I\u2019m still not used to it.\u201d", "Jang Maldong also laughed.", "\u201c\u2026So.\u201d", "While a warm atmosphere flowed between the master and the disciple, Phi Sora spoke indifferently.", "\u201cWhy did you wink at me? You better not ask me out on a date, saying we haven\u2019t met in a while.\u201d", "Phi Sora put down her foot, having suffered from Seol Jihu\u2019s manipulations multiple times already.", "\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked around at the few members that were still in the cafeteria, eating, and then spoke.", "\u201cShould we move to a quieter place?\u201d", "The three of them then left the cafeteria and moved to Team 1\u2019s office.", "\u201cI heard that you introduced Seol-Ah to the Federation.\u201d", "Seol Jihu brought up the matter that he was curious about the most.", "\u201cAh, you mean Yishino Seolara?\u201d", "\u201cWho?\u201d", "\u201cYep. I asked Mister Marcel Ghionea to help her form a contract with a Spirit.\u201d", "Phi Sora giggled.", "\u201cBut don\u2019t misunderstand. I didn\u2019t help her because I like her or anything. There was your request, and I also just thought it was a waste of valuable talent.\u201d", "Seol Jihu gave Phi Sora an odd look as she acted like a typical tsundere.", "\u201c\u2026Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d", "\u201cNothing. So, are Sungjin and Seol-Ah back yet?\u201d", "\u201cYi Sungjin is in the middle of an expedition, and Yishino Seolara came back a week ago.\u201d", "\u201cWhy are you mixing Seol-Ah\u2019s name with Miss Hoshino Urara?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll know once you see her. It\u2019s\u2026 kind of hard to believe. I wonder just what she learned in the Federation to have become like that\u2026 Though, it\u2019s much better than the victim cosplay she used to do before.\u201d", "Phi Sora smacked her lips.", "The way Seol Jihu understood it, it sounded like Yi Seol-Ah was Hoshino Urara-fied.", "For such a kind, soft-spoken girl to become a madwoman\u2026 it was indeed hard to believe.", "\u201cWell, it looks like she had some gains.\u201d", "Phi Sora continued.", "\u201cI guess you can say she\u2019s finally like an Archer now. She seemed pretty skilled at handling her Spirit, and she also rose to Level 4. She might even become a High Ranker soon.\u201d", "\u201cA High Ranker? Really?\u201d", "\u201cTo be more precise, I heard she was given a free pass for the High Ranker examination. Her spending more than half a year in the Hiral Mountain Range counted as a valuable contribution apparently.\u201d", "Seol Jihu unknowingly exclaimed.", "Although he had never been to the Hiral Mountain Range, he knew it was a dangerous place where scuffles against the Parasites were common.", "She must have constantly fought the Parasites while working as a scout in that region, so her receiving a free pass wasn\u2019t so hard to accept.", "\u201cI could tell she went through a lot while she was there. Anyway, it sounded like she had enough contribution points and only needed more experience points\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora trailed off in the middle of her explanation.", "Seol Jihu and Phi Sora simultaneously turned toward the door.", "Speaking of the devil, the closed door opened with a clunk.", "Next, an unusual storm charged into the room.", "\u201cO, ra, beo, niiiim!\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "He could see a teenage girl, who received the news late, running toward him.", "No, she was floating above the ground, stirring up winds by kicking the air and quite literally flying at him.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stop using your Spirit inside the building!?\u201d", "Phi Sora shouted.", "Yi Seol-Ah rushed into the room, ignoring Phi Sora completely, and then came to a sudden stop.", "Dancing in the air, she looked down at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cHe\u2019s the real one!\u201d", "Whish! She shot down in an instant and hugged him.", "Seol Jihu flinched.", "Her past long black hair was nowhere to be found, and he saw short hair that only half-covered her neck.", "\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Aura!\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah shouted into the empty air.", "\u201cThis is him! This is my Orabeo-nim! Representative Seol!\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu could clearly sense a foreign mass of energy in the air.", "It twisted its body bashfully and stealthily hid behind Yi Seol-Ah. Though it acted cute and child-like, it gave off a rather powerful energy.", "Though Seol Jihu did not stay inside the Spirit Realm for long, he had not come across such a powerful Spirit other than the Spirit Kings.", "\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re embarrassed? You\u2019ve been wanting to see him since forever, asking me when he\u2019s coming back everyday\u2026 Huh? You want me to be quiet because you\u2019re embarrassed? You need time to compose yourself? You want to start by writing a letter? Am I crazy? I should shut up?\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah advertised Aura\u2019s words to the whole world in a rich, fruity voice.", "Seol Jihu chuckled before suddenly furrowing brows.", "\u201c\u2026Seol-Ah?\u201d", "\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019m sorry! Don\u2019t say you\u2019re gonna pack up and leave\u2026 Huh?\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah quickly turned to Seol Jihu, who was pointing at the girl\u2019s face.", "\u201cYour\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Oh, this?\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah rubbed the back end of her hair and smiled cheerfully.", "\u201cI cut it short because it was getting in the way in fights. What do you think? This suits me too, right?\u201d", "It did suit her. It highlighted her cheerful, sweet smile well. The way it gave the impression of liveliness, she seemed like a pretty boy as well.", "But the problem wasn\u2019t with her hairstyle.", "\u201cYour eye.\u201d", "There was a long scar cutting across her left eye.", "\u201cAh\u2026\u201d", "Quickly falling silent, Yi Seol-Ah gently rubbed her left eye and then smiled.", "\u201cWell\u2026 it was the price of lowering my guard. Huu. When it rains\u2026 this scar stings a bit\u2026\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t start that again.\u201d", "Phi Sora cut in, unable to stand watching her give the same cringey speech.", "Yi Seol-Ah giggled.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing though. I got it while I was fighting an Evil Phantom.\u201d", "Seol Jihu doubted his ears.", "\u201cEvil Phantom? You fought an Evil Phantom?\u201d", "\u201cYep. Tang! A gunshot sound suddenly rang out, and then my eyes started burning\u2026 Thankfully, the first shot missed because of Aura. And then Taitaitai Unni came to save me right away.\u201d", "This \u2018Taitaitai Unni\u2019 seemed to be the Fairy General, Taihi Ingraria, but Seol Jihu decided to gloss over that for now.", "\u201cShouldn\u2019t you get it treated? Scars get harder to erase the longer they stay with you.\u201d", "\u201cI know, but I want to keep it.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cTo be honest, it hasn\u2019t been that long since I got this scar. Was it a week before I came back? It was when I was feeling confident and content with my strength.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah smiled bitterly.", "\u201cI was too excited that I was playing around and got hurt when I could have avoided it\u2026. I thought about getting rid of it, but then I remember that incident every time I look at the mirror and think, \u2018Ah, the Parasites really aren\u2019t easy to deal with. I shouldn\u2019t have fooled around like that back then\u2026\u2019\u201d", "So it seemed Yi Seol-Ah wanted to keep the scar as a reminder not to make the same mistake.", "Seol Jihu nodded his head in approval. Since this was what she herself wished for, he didn\u2019t see the need to force her or convince her otherwise.", "\u201cBut this scar actually has its good point.\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah bent her knees slightly and then hopped up.", "Using the air as a chair, she lifted her right leg and slowly crossed it over her left thigh. She lowered her head in a 45-degree angle, crossed her arms, and then gave a seductive wink.", "\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of sensual? Like it feels dangerous, but in an alluring, provocative way~\u201d", "\u201cOh god,\u201d Phi Sora\u2019s sigh rang out.", "\u201cKeuk,\u201d A laughter escaped Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth. He clenched his teeth and nodded his head.", "Right, it was sexy. But it was an adorable, lovable sexiness.", "\u201cHey, can\u2019t you see that we\u2019re talking?\u201d", "Phi Sora spoke in an annoyed tone.", "\u201cCome on, I haven\u2019t seen him in ages. I want to talk to him more!\u201d", "\u201cDo it later. An ordinary member shouldn\u2019t be barging into the office when the representative is talking with the adviser and a team leader!\u201d", "\u201cMeh! You bully!\u201d", "\u201cWhat was that?\u201d", "\u201cOkay, fine! I\u2019ll leave!\u201d", "The self-proclaimed, Sexy Seol-Ah pouted. She floated back down and then slammed something down on the desk.", "\u201cEat this!\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s this\u2026? A fruit?\u201d", "Phi Sora raised her eyebrow after rummaging through the bag she placed on the desk. It was filled with her favorite fruit from Paradise.", "\u201cI bought some on my way back from my morning jog. Shouldn\u2019t high-ranking people have some refreshments while they talk? How can you be so thoughtless?\u201d", "\u201cAre you hearing yourself right now? Why would you buy this?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. I didn\u2019t buy them to give them to you. They just caught my attention.\u201d", "Seeing this exchange, Seol Jihu and Jang Maldong laughed quietly. The way she was chattering with an indifferent expression, it was obvious who she was imitating.", "\u201cW-W-Wha\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora seemed to be at a loss for words because of it.", "Yi Seol-Ah turned her head with a hmph and then clapped her hands after seeing Seol Jihu.", "\u201cOrabeo-nim! Let\u2019s have a race later!\u201d", "\u201cSure. Are you confident?\u201d", "\u201cHuhu, I\u2019ll show you the true power of Sexy Provocative Seol-Ah. The loser has to grant 5,000 wishes to the winner!\u201d", "\u2018Bang!\u2019 Yi Seol-Ah shot Seol Jihu with a finger gun before winking at him and flying out of the room.", "The storm left just as quickly as it rushed in.", "\u201c\u2026Do you see why I call her Yishino Seolara?\u201d", "Phi Sora gritted her teeth as soon as the door closed behind her.", "Seol Jihu had no choice but to agree.", "Bubbly like a sparkling soda. That would be how Seol Jihu would describe the current Yi Seol-Ah. Though she was a little too bubbly, it was far better than being flat.", "\u201cAnyway, you winked at me just to ask about Seol-Ah and Sungjin?\u201d", "That wasn\u2019t the case. While that was one of the things Seol Jihu wanted to check up on, his real goal was something else.", "\u201cI have a favor to ask.\u201d", "Now that his curiosity had been satisfied, Seol Jihu cut to the chase.", "\u201cCan you spar with me one more time?\u201d", "Phi Sora paused while shuffling through the fruits. She then raised her eyes as she slowly picked out a fruit.", "\u201cThe first thing you want to do after coming back from your training is to show off your strength? Why, are you confident in winning now?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get revenge or anything.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head.", "\u201cI want the same condition as before. Fighting without using mana.\u201d", "Phi Sora furrowed her brows. Jang Maldong let out a surprised grunt as well.", "This made his favor rather intriguing.", "No one knew exactly where Seol Jihu had been for the past eight months. Even how long he had been there and what exactly he had been doing were a mystery.", "The only person who had an idea was Baek Haeju. Kim Hannah and the others only knew that Seol Jihu had gone to use the Divine Stigmata.", "\u201cHmm.\u201d", "Jang Maldong was worried as he didn\u2019t know anything about the Divine Stigmata. Because the current Phi Sora was several times stronger than the past.", "Time was fair to everyone.", "Phi Sora did not just sit around during the eight months that Seol Jihu was gone. She spent the majority of the time training in Mount Pel\u00e9eom\u2019s volcanic region, and Jang Maldong had also guided her with all his heart.", "The result of her hard work was revealed not long ago.", "As such, Jang Maldong judged Phi Sora to be the strongest member among Valhalla\u2019s official members.", "She was far out of Chung Chohong\u2019s reach, and there was a chance that she would not lose to Hoshino Urara either.", "He didn\u2019t know how much Seol Jihu improved during this time, but he did not think Phi Sora would lose in a battle of technique that left out the use of mana.", "\u201cDid you make some gains?\u201d", "\u201cGrandpa, wait.\u201d", "Just as Jang Maldong carefully asked, Phi Sora raised her hand and asked.", "\u201cWhy me?\u201d", "\u201cBecause Miss Phi Sora is the only one.\u201d", "\u201cWhy not Chohong or Hoshino Urara?\u201d", "\u201cThey won\u2019t do. I wanted to ask Miss Baek Haeju, but she\u2019s not around. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you.\u201d", "\u201cBecause Miss Baek Haeju isn\u2019t here\u2026? Hah.\u201d", "Phi Sora let out a chuckle.", "Did he say that knowing what position Baek Haeju held within Paradise?", "\u201cYou know you sound really arrogant right now.\u201d", "\u201cWhile I was cultivating\u2026\u201d[1]", "Feeling that more explanation was in order, Seol Jihu said.", "\u201cI thought about you from time to time.\u201d", "\u201cMe? Why?\u201d", "Phi Sora blinked with a somewhat uneasy look.", "\u201cBecause the more I thought about it, the more amazing you seemed.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you reach an independent realm without anyone\u2019s help?\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 yes, if you\u2019re talking about One With the Sword. It\u2019s not something you can learn by having someone teach it to you.\u201d", "\u201cRight, and you achieved that on your own! This time, I learned just how amazing that really is. I even got a new-found respect for you. That\u2019s why I want to fight you one more time.\u201d", "Seol Jihu carried himself with gravitas while sounding completely serious. He didn\u2019t seem to be joking at all.", "From Phi Sora\u2019s perspective, the hero of Paradise was directly expressing his respect for her as a martial artist.", "\u201cEr, well, if you put it that way\u2026. Though I might be a little dumb, I guess I am pretty talented with swords\u2026\u201d", "She sounded calm and unfazed, but her nose was already reaching the height of Eiffel Tower.", "But she wasn\u2019t necessarily wrong.", "Phi Sora\u2019s aptitude was \u2018Brilliant\u2019 and \u2018Passionate\u2019. These two traits were specialized for battle and swordsmanship.", "\u201cAlright, I guess it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been wanting to test my techniques, which have been optimized for Level 6, anyways. I\u2019m also curious how strong you\u2019ve gotten.\u201d", "Phi Sora fiddled with the fruit excitedly. Then\u2026", "\u201cOh yeah.\u201d", "She gave a sharp look.", "\u201cYou know I don\u2019t go easy, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded silently. He then spoke with a light bow.", "\u201cPlease take care of me.\u201d", "\u201cOkay.\u201d", "Phi Sora got up and then brought the fruit to her mouth.", "Crunch. After taking a bite, she puffed out her cheeks and pointed to the door.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "1. He specifically uses the word \u2018cultivating\u2019 rather than \u2018training\u2019. "]}
