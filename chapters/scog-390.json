Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold (3)", "content": ["On a dark, drizzling night, in an open space of an empty mountain range where it would not be surprising for the Parasites to appear, Seol Jihu and his two comrades heard Seo Yuhui\u2019s scream.", "Though they rushed back to their campsite, they could only make dumbfounded faces upon arrival.", "The situation had already winded down. Seo Yuhui was subdued, and Chohong was grunting with her hand pressed down on her side.", "No one blamed Chohong. There were at least a few dozen people in view. Including the people hiding and in blind spots, the number of assailants could easily surpass a hundred.", "Each of them was covering their face with a mask and their body with a cape, and they surrounded the campsite as soon as Seol Jihu and the two girls showed up.", "Based on their agile movements, they seemed to have been trained for situations like this.", "Moreover, the five people surrounding Seo Yuhui gave off powerful auras.", "Seol Jihu quickly scanned them with the Nine Eyes, revealing them all to be Level 6s.", "He smacked his lips and swallowed his saliva.", "\u201cStrange\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel anyone following us.\u201d", "Hoshino Urara murmured as she spun a dagger with her finger.", "\u201cIf they didn\u2019t follow us, that must mean they were here already. After seeing the three of us leave, they pounced\u2026 So this whole thing was a trap?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I heard you were just a crazy bitch.\u201d", "A husky voice rang out.", "\u201cTurns out you know your stuff.\u201d", "One of the people holding Seo Yuhui captive walked forward.

If you move so suddenly, we can\u2019t promise what\u2019s going to happen to her.\u201d", "The woman pointed back by turning her chin.", "A man boasting a large build raised his arm, dragging Seo Yuhui up by her neck.", "\u201cHeeuuu~\u201d", "As Seo Yuhui flailed her legs in the air, the burly man drew his face near her and took in a deep breath.", "\u201cAh, this woman\u2019s scent\u2026 I can\u2019t resist it. What a bewitching fragrance. Heeuuu~\u201d", "Seo Yuhui trembled while scratching the cauldron-sized hand that was clutching onto her neck.", "When she glared at the burly man revoltingly like looking at a disgusting bug, the burly man snorted violently as if it excited him even more.", "\u201cKehehehe. The flower of Paradise that even Sung Shihyun couldn\u2019t pluck is in my hands\u2026 Oi, can\u2019t you get this over with? I don\u2019t know if I can hold out any longer.\u201d", "\u201cShut it.

Don\u2019t you get what\u2019s happening?\u201d", "She seemed to be mocking him.", "Seol Jihu quickly took a look around.

Gorad Boga is what you want, right? We\u2019ll hand it over, so let go of Yuhui Noona. Hurry. We\u2019ll leave right away.\u201d", "Silence descended on the campsite.", "\u201c\u2026Jeez, do you really not get it?\u201d", "The woman muttered dumbfoundedly.", "\u201cYou must have heard the Archer next to you. Are you trying to deny reality? \u2026Well, this must be the first failure for the hero who\u2019s always walked a regal road. With death staring down at you, I guess you must be quite shocked.\u201d", "Snickers rang out from their surroundings.", "\u201cWhat do you mean? Isn\u2019t Gorad Boga what you want? Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here?

And here I was thinking you\u2019d at least have a brain.\u201d", "The woman clicked her tongue.", "\u201cYour Archer was right. We\u2019ve been waiting here in ambush for several days now. In other words, we knew you would be coming here. How\u2019s that? Are you now starting to understand what\u2019s going on?\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked.", "He then made a shocked face, dropping his jaw.", "\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d", "\u201cFinally! That\u2019s right. You\u2019ve been running circles on the bishop\u2019s palm this whole time.\u201d", "\u201cSeol! What do you mean? Didn\u2019t you say you found out about Gorad Boga?\u201d", "Chohong asked with a frown.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t reply.

Without it\u2026!\u201d", "Seol Jihu bit his lower lip in the middle.", "\u201cWell, we put in a lot of effort too.\u201d", "The woman shrugged.", "\u201cWe buried offerings everywhere so that you\u2019d think this place is Gorad Boga.\u201d", "Seol Jihu widened his mouth. He looked like he was struck speechless.", "He dropped his head in the next moment and muttered.", "\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cWhy are you doing this!? Aren\u2019t you guys Earthlings too!? We\u2019re on the same side! So why\u2026!?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what you think. Who told you to piss off the wrong people?\u201d", "The woman rejected Seol Jihu\u2019s notion.", "\u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought this upon yourself. Haven\u2019t you thought that the Parasites might attack humanity instead of the Federation because of you?\u201d", "\u201cBullshit!\u201d", "\u201cAh, I understand how you feel. I\u2019m sure you feel wronged given how hard you have worked.

Are you going to fight? Or are you going to die gracefully?\u201d", "Seol Jihu gripped the Spear of Purity with a scowl.", "\u201cI\u2019ll obediently\u2026\u201d", "\u201cDie? Oh please, like we\u2019re supposed to believe that.

An average level of 5.75\u2026 We get it. You guys are strong.

Several organizations sent their most prized elites to dispatch you, so we\u2019ve got quite a crowd here.

The huge part of the gown and the priest\u2019s robe that Seo Yuhui wore as an outer garment rolled down.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes shot open.", "\u201cStop\u2026!\u201d", "However, the priest\u2019s robe became tattered in an instant and narrowly revealed Seo Yuhui\u2019s bare skin.", "\u201cUhyah!\u201d", "The burly man exclaimed.", "\u201cAuu! Look at this bitch\u2019s tits. These cow-tits!\u201d", "Seo Yuhui twisted her body left and right in an attempt to hide the faintly visible skin, but it was futile. Those who saw her milky white skin cheered.", "As if to respond to the crowd\u2019s cheers, the burly man tried to pull down her underwear too.", "\u201cStop here for now.\u201d", "However, the woman stopped him.", "\u201cYou know something? The Star of Lust who\u2019s currently in my comrade\u2019s hands. There are more than a few people who are enamored with her.\u201d", "Ooooooh! Fweeeet!", "\u201cYou hear that? Paradise\u2019s legend-cum-flower is in our hands, and everyone\u2019s dying to pluck her.\u201d", "The woman snickered.", "\u201cIf you choose to fight, my comrades here will be very angry about losing their friends.

I can\u2019t think of a more humiliating way to die than being gang-raped to death. That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving you a choice.\u201d", "She then pointed at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cJust die peacefully. Then as a show of thanks, we\u2019ll kill the rest swiftly and cleanly before they can feel any pain.

Though it was partially because she was nervous, it was mainly because she was focused on doing what Seol Jihu asked her to do.", "The woman stood leisurely as she watched Seol Jihu\u2019s face contorting with rage.", "She didn\u2019t urge him on purpose.", "If Seol Jihu agreed to her deal, she would be able to kill him with ease, which would undoubtedly be the best possible outcome.", "Even if he didn\u2019t agree, it didn\u2019t matter. The reason she took her sweet time and even gave him time to think was all a part of her back-up plan.", "Because\u2026", "Tuk!", "It was then.", "After a few minutes had gone by, Seol Jihu dropped the Spear of Purity.", "The surrounding assailants stirred as if they didn\u2019t expect him to comply.", "The woman was also surprised, but she calmed down and spoke.", "\u201cThrow it over to us.\u201d", "\u201cAh! Don\u2019t! I\u2019ll be fine!\u201d", "Chohong shouted at the top of her lungs.

I can see that he\u2019s smart.\u201d", "The woman spoke quickly.", "\u201cThey\u2019re all going to revive on Earth anyway.

Before I die.\u201d", "He asked with a voice tinged with despair.", "\u201cMm\u2026 Sure, as long as you\u2019re not going to waste time asking why we\u2019re doing this.\u201d", "The woman nodded her head.", "\u201cHaramark.\u201d", "Seol Jihu quietly said.", "\u201cAttacking Yuhui Noona in Haramark\u2026 Trying to besmirch my name\u2026 Were you guys responsible for those things as well?\u201d", "\u201cAh, that?\u201d", "\u201cDid the bishop order you guys to do that too?\u201d", "The woman sniggered quietly before lifting her chin up.", "\u201cYou just figured it out? Well, our bishop is pretty scrupulous in how he does things.\u201d", "\u201cSo it\u2019s true\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu clenched his fists. He raised his head, but just as he was about to say something, he widened his eyes.", "\u201cYou guys\u2026 Huh? Ah, really?\u201d", "He spoke while staring into the air, or more precisely, at Seo Yuhui.", "\u201cAh\u2026 sorry. I must have gotten too absorbed in my role. No, no, don\u2019t kill them. This is a good opportunity, but I still have use for those five.\u201d", "What was certain was that he wasn\u2019t talking to the woman.", "Just as the woman started to believe that he went insane from shock\u2026", "\u201cYes, you can come here now. Looks like we already got most of the important information out of her.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "The woman asked back in doubt.", "And then a loud scream burst out.", "\u201cAAAAAACK!\u201d", "The burly man writhed in pain while clutching his hand.", "Seo Yuhui, whom he inadvertently dropped, was floating in the air.", "\u201c!\u201d", "Even in the pitch-black darkness of the night, the woman could see clearly.", "A cloud of black smoke was flying toward Seol Jihu while coiled around Seo Yuhui.", "\u2018W-What the hell?\u2019", "She couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.", "She was never told anything about such an ability or artifact.", "[Sorry, I know I was supposed to wait for the signal, but it looked like this unni was in too much pain\u2026]", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I was about to give the signal anyways.\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked down.", "Seo Yuhui was sitting in a curled up position, shaking like a leaf.", "Her breathing was rough.

That time heals all sorrows.\u201d", "Seol Jihu cracked his neck.", "\u201cTurns out, it\u2019s wrong. There are things you can\u2019t forget even after ten years go by.
