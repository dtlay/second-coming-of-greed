First, its surface was brighter and smoother than before. Now, it looked more like a jade than an egg.", "It might just be him, but he felt the egg heat up.", "His hand, which was holding onto the egg, felt warm.", "Seol Jihu looked a little disappointed.", "Well, it wasn\u2019t that he expected some incredible effect, but he was at least hoping it would hatch right away.", "[The test has begun the moment I gave it divine power.]", "A gentle voice awakened Seol Jihu\u2019s mind.", "\u2018Not after it hatches?\u2019", "[Of course. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about cases where not a single Authority was granted to the spear\u2019s master, right?]", "That meant the Arcus Spirit might refuse to hatch altogether.", "Seol Jihu was blown back.", "\u2018What kind of a tricky Spirit is this?\u2019", "Anyway, he had met the minimum requirement.", "Seol Jihu courteously expressed his gratitude. Gula always had her head in the clouds when she explained things, but Luxuria spoke clearly. Seol Jihu liked that a lot about her.", "[Once the Arcus Spirit awakens, you\u2019ll have to come to the temple a lot more often.]", "\u2018For divine power?\u2019", "[Yes. You\u2019ll be responsible for its growth the moment you become its master.]", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Now he was unexpectedly entrusted with childcare as well.", "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he apparently had to exchange contribution points he\u2019d gathered up to feed it divine power.", "Seol Jihu sighed.", "\u2018\u2026Should I just sell it and buy another good spear?\u2019", "He even had this embarrassing thought.", "[No, you can\u2019t. I told you, the Arcus Spirit will become a powerful ally and partner, and not just for its Authority. Using contribution points for a lifelong companion isn\u2019t a loss at all.]", "\u2018I see your point\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips and put the egg away in his pocket.", "[You can exchange contribution points for divine power wherever you go, but\u2026]", "Luxuria giggled and raised her voice cheerfully.", "[But I\u2019m hoping my baby will come to my temple more!]", "Seol Jihu smiled awkwardly.", "\u2018I\u2019m not a baby.\u2019", "A healthy, 26-year-old man, a baby?", "Of course, he might be a baby in a god\u2019s eyes, but Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but raise an objection from embarrassment.", "[Fufu.]", "Luxuria let out an indecipherable laugh.", "[To me, you\u2019re still a cute baby\u2026 you were back then, and you are now.]", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "*", "Sinyoung Pharmaceuticals.", "Going back to roots, Sinyoung started from a business called Soonyang Pharmaceuticals. Although it was only a medium-sized company, when CEO Yun Seojin was invited to Paradise by coincidence, his life changed completely.", "Being excited about a new beginning lasted only a moment. It wasn\u2019t as if his disposition as a businessman, who raised a small family business into a mid-sized enterprise, went anywhere.", "By amassing contribution points, he could take Paradise\u2019s items to Earth.", "Meaning, Paradise was profitable.", "The moment he realized this, Chairman Yun Seojin moved fast.", "He decided to found a new company that was based in Paradise.", "Of all the products Paradise had to offer, what caught his eye was medicine.", "Not only did Paradise have all sorts of mystical medicine, but it also had potions and other drugs made with herbs and alchemy.", "There were all kinds of ingredients he had never even heard of before. To Chairman Yun Seojin, Paradise was a true treasure cove.", "His first product was a liquid medicine that was a diluted version of a potion that raised one\u2019s focus.", "He released it as a sports drink and distributed it not only in pharmacies but also at convenience stores. The result, a massive success.", "Even though he thinned the effect by over a half, the drink immediately cleared up one\u2019s mind and raised their focus for 10 or so minutes. To consumers, it was quite a refreshing product.", "Parents of students were even more excited. Almost explosively excited, even.", "Because of its instantaneous effect, stories of the product spread through the internet like wildfire, and sales saw a steep increase.", "Chairman Yun Seojin didn\u2019t stop there. Settling Soonyang and establishing Sinyoung, he began his Paradise business for real.", "Of course, he couldn\u2019t reveal the existence of Paradise in accordance with the oath, but that didn\u2019t pose a problem.", "In fact, that was what he wanted.", "All he had to do was establish a research institute and say his researchers succeeded in developing new medicine.", "And now, Sinyoung proudly boasted its name in the top ranks of Korea\u2019s pharmaceutical companies, and with hundreds of employees just in its headquarters alone, it was a fully-fledged conglomerate.", "According to the media, if it weren\u2019t for Soyoung Trading Corporation, Hayeon Science, Haesol Institute, and Beauty Vivien, Sinyoung would rank as number one among all conglomerates.", "Going back to the main topic, Sinyoung was the first organization to have adopted a \u2018company\u2019 concept in Paradise.", "While it didn\u2019t seem like it would suit a place like Paradise, as that was how Sinyoung operated, it naturally had an internal company hierarchy and a department that evaluated their employees.", "Murmur, murmur.", "Sinyoung\u2019s first-floor lobby was unusually busy today. Quite a few people were gathered in front of the noticeboard, checking the company announcement.", "The title said this: Personnel Transfer.", "It was unusual in a way. The employees\u2019 performance only really affected whether they got promotions, and layoffs in Paradise were practically non-existent. This was because they had to spend a considerable amount of contribution points to purchase a stamp when hiring a new employee.", "Of course, the announcement posted in the lobby wasn\u2019t about a layoff, but a personnel transfer could be similar to one, depending on where one was transferred to.", "Clack, clack.", "When the sound of high-heels rang out, three or four people standing in the center turned back. Seeing who was walking up behind them, they flinched and staggered to the side.", "The crowd gathered in front of the noticeboard split like the Red Sea.", "A ponytailed woman wearing a neat grey suit cut through the crowd.", "Stopping in front of the noticeboard, she read the announcement without batting an eyelid.", "Her gaze stopped in the middle of the list of six names.", "\u2014Personnel Transfer\u2026.Chief Kim Hannah \u2192 Transferred to Attack Team\u2026.", "A hint of bitterness flashed across her face when she saw her name.

Or should I call you Manager Kim now?\u201d", "Kim Hannah stared at the director, who was striking up a chummy conversation.", "Congrats? Kim Hannah was a non-combatant specialized for business. Leaving the recruitment team, which had a strong voice in the company, and being moved to the attack team was something to be congratulated about?", "Anyone who knew even a little bit of what was going on would say it was too harsh. However, Kim Hannah\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest.", "In fact, she bowed with a faint smile.", "\u201cThank you, director.\u201d", "The director patted Kim Hannah\u2019s shoulder with a gentle smile.", "\u201cGood luck out there. I put in a good word for you, so don\u2019t make me lose face.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d", "\u201cGood, you better. Well, I don\u2019t doubt you\u2019ll do fantastic, Manager Kim. Ah, can you hurry up with organizing your past duties for the transfer? We have a new chief coming in soon.\u201d", "Kim Hannah secretly swallowed hard before smiling.", "\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d", "Even though the two of them were all smiles, their eyes weren\u2019t friendly in the slightest. In fact, they both seemed tired of each other.", "\u201cShin Hansung has been waiting for ages, you see.\u201d", "\u201cI understand.\u201d", "Kim Hannah bowed courteously before turning around. The director stared fixedly as Kim Hannah walked away without a single hint of agitation.", "*", "\u201cHow was it?\u201d", "A cheerful voice rang out as soon as the planning department door, located on the highest floor of Sinyoung, opened.", "As the director had experienced this several times before, he simply bowed and replied.", "\u201cHer expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest.\u201d", "\u201cOh really?\u201d", "Yun Seohui looked rather amused, sitting in front of her desk.", "\u201cI wonder what she\u2019s thinking about. I doubt Chief Kim doesn\u2019t know. After all, she\u2019s known as a fox~\u201d", "\u201cOh I\u2019m sure she understands the situation, but I also know she\u2019s full of grit. She might really try to endure.\u201d", "\u201cThen it\u2019s your job, director, to make sure she doesn\u2019t.\u201d", "Speaking clearly, Yun Seohui stretched.", "\u201cAaaaah~ Our Chief Kim~ If only she squashed her ambition a little~\u201d", "Chuckling to herself, she put her arms down before glancing over at the director. She had expected him to say \u201cI agree\u201d or something along that line, but he was surprisingly silent.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026I\u2026\u201d", "The director seemed conflicted, but he barely managed to eke out his thoughts.", "\u201cIt may be presumptuous of me\u2026 but why not let her endure for a little while longer?

I don\u2019t blame you. You\u2019re the one who raised her, after all.\u201d", "\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d", "\u201cChief Kim is competent. She\u2019s a talented individual, no doubt about it.\u201d", "Yun Seohui readily agreed. Then, she spoke.", "\u201cSinyoung has many competent individuals. Even the bottom of the barrel employees are picked meticulously, no?\u201d", "What Yun Seohui meant was simple. She couldn\u2019t deny that Kim Hannah was competent, but that didn\u2019t mean that missing her would leave Sinyoung with an uncoverable hole.", "Yun Seohui spoke as she slowly lowered her arm.", "\u201cAlso, about that connecting link. Didn\u2019t we settle this last time?\u201d", "The new method Yun Seohui chose to recruit Seol Jihu was truly clear-cut.", "Since she couldn\u2019t touch him, she would make him come to her.", "Just like when she took in Sung Shihyun.", "The cause of this sudden change in plan lay in Seol Jihu\u2019s rapid growth.", "At first, she planned to look for the right opportunity to recruit him. That was why she put Kim Hannah, their best recruiter, to take care of him.", "But because Seol Jihu grew at a speed that far surpassed their wildest imaginations, Sinyoung had no choice but to suck on their thumbs and watch.", "A good example was the recent incident where an unknown organization tried to blemish his record. The Triads, Sicilia, Assassination Guild, and Haramark Royal Family had all risen up to help him.", "The important thing was that Kim Hannah was responsible for Sinyoung having to remain a spectator.", "Kim Hannah periodically submitted reports on Seol Jihu, and she had always attached excuses to delay Sinyoung coming into contact with him.", "Meanwhile, Seol Jihu surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations and raised his personal value, gathering comrades and making connections. And in the war, he put the nail in the coffin.", "Yun Seohui wasn\u2019t a fool.", "Reassessing just where Sinyoung had gone wrong, she discovered that there were many discrepancies between Seol Jihu\u2019s achievements and what Kim Hannah reported.", "It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out why Kim Hannah went so far to prevent Sinyoung from making contact.", "It was just that Kim Hannah had hidden it well and prevented Yun Seohui from finding out.", "Canceling Kim Hannah\u2019s plan through her authority and personally going to the cafe was an ultimatum of sorts. Yun Seohui had given Kim Hannah a chance to fix the situation.", "However, Kim Hannah didn\u2019t take any action, so Yun Seohui made her own move.", "\u201cI would have let her be for a little longer if she didn\u2019t try to borrow Seora\u2019s power.\u201d", "Yun Seohui chortled. She understood why people would want to fill another pocket, but even that had a limit.", "Seol Jihu would most likely become one of the titans of Paradise in the future. Yun Seohui wasn\u2019t the type to simply let him be an outside collaborator.", "He had grown so much in less than a year. What would happen if Kim Hannah openly supported Yun Seora in a year or two, when Seol Jihu had become a Unique Ranker?", "Then, things would really be out of her control.", "\u201cA stitch in time saves nine.\u201d", "\u201cBut if you chase her out, Seol Jihu might not think so well of it\u2026\u201d", "\u201cOh? What do you mean by that?\u201d", "Yun Seohui widened her eyes and tilted her head.", "\u201cI thought Chief Kim was walking out with her own feet?\u201d", "When the director gave a bitter smile, Yun Seohui continued.", "\u201cWell, he might not think well of it, but I doubt he\u2019d draw his weapon and barge in. Besides, it is my job to handle Mister Seol Jihu\u2019s law of causality. It isn\u2019t yours, director.\u201d", "The director still insisted.", "\u201cYes, you\u2019re certainly right. But we have to consider Chief Kim leaving Sinyoung and forming an organization with Seol Jihu\u2026\u201d", "\u201cDirector.\u201d", "Yun Seohui gently cut off the director.", "\u201cWhat are you worried about so much? Organization? Do you think it\u2019s so easy to register as an organization? So much so that it can be made in a single day?\u201d", "\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d", "\u201cEven if they do make an organization\u2026 well, who cares? As far as I know~\u201d", "Yun Seohui slurred the end of her speech as her eyes curled up like a crescent moon.", "\u201c\u2026Chief Kim has many enemies around her.\u201d", "Her cold voice sent a shiver down the director\u2019s spine. Because her face was making a sweet smile, the discrepancy was even more chilling.", "The director shut his mouth instinctively. He felt like he just saw a line he should never cross.", "Yun Seohui had to be allowing his impudence knowing his loyalty. But at the end of the day, even a hunting dog was a dog. He had to act properly if he wanted his owner to feed him.", "\u201cI understand.\u201d", "Just as the director bowed and turned back\u2026", "\u201cOh, by the way, director.\u201d", "Yun Seohui stopped him as if she just thought of something.", "\u201cHave you looked into the organization that tried to stain Mister Seol Jihu?\u201d", "\u201cAh, that incident, you mean?\u201d", "The director furrowed his brows.", "\u201cYou see\u2026 my apologies, but we are not sure. The information team is still working on it, but they haven\u2019t made any progress\u2026\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026 it must be hard. Keep going at it. This is a very important task.\u201d", "\u201cIs it?\u201d", "A light flashed across the director\u2019s eyes when Yun Seohui called it a \u2018very important\u2019 task.", "\u201cOf course, it will come in handy while dealing with the law of causality. And also\u2026\u201d", "Yun Seohui took a bite of her sherbet using the tiny spoon she was grabbing with her index finger and thumb.", "Her lovely lips closed in as she shrugged nonchalantly.", "\u201cYou know my personality, don\u2019t you? I rea~lly hate having someone touch my belongings without permission.\u201d", "As the director had watched over Yun Seohui from a young age, he calmly nodded his head.", "\u201cYes, of course. I will visit the information team again.\u201d", "\u201cThank you. You must be busy. You can leave now.\u201d", "Yun Seohui waved her hand with a charming smile.", "*", "After coming back to the office, Seol Jihu studied the egg carefully.", "He had just fed it Luxuria\u2019s divine power, but it stood firm even when he nudged it a couple of times, incubated it, and used it as a bowling ball to hit a bunch of nails.", "\u201cOoh! Another strike!\u201d", "[Hey! What are you doing!?]", "Bowling with it turned out to be pretty fun, so he did it a few times before Flone caught him and smacked him in the back.", "Anyway, the egg refused to move no matter what he did.", "\u2018Well, nothing I can do I guess.\u2019", "It\u2019ll hatch when it wants to.", "Murmuring to himself, Seol Jihu hopped onto his bed. After taking ages to convince Flone to introduce herself to the team, he unknowingly fell asleep.", "That was why he couldn\u2019t see it.", "The egg sitting by his head twitching furiously.", "Not really sure what Yun Seohui means when she's talking about dealing with the law of causality..."]}
