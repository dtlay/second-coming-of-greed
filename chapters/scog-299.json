Now that he thought about it, he hadn\u2019t paid attention to anything that was going on in the Neutral Zone since he started his personal training.", "Over ten weeks had gone by since the start of the Neutral Zone, so there were less than two weeks remaining. With the end in sight, there must be things Kim Hannah needed to discuss with him.", "And so, Seol Jihu got a good night\u2019s sleep for the first time in a while and left his room rather late next morning. His plan for the day was to talk to Kim Hannah and have a look around the Neutral Zone. After all, he was the representative of the managing organization.", "The Neutral Zone was bustling like usual. Due to the high number of entrants, most of the stores were booming. Among them, the regular store was the most eye-catching as many people were gathered there in particular.", "\u2018Seol-Ah and Sungjin are in charge of the regular store\u2026\u2019", "As Seol Jihu broke through the crowd making a circle around the store\u2026", "\u201cLive~ Live! Ah, live, live, live!\u201d", "He could hear a cheerful singing that sounded like the humming of a skylark.", "\u201cWelcome everyone to the Brother and Sister Store~\u201d", "Seol Jihu almost burst into laughter. Yi Seol-Ah was standing in front of the store, touting for business with a lively dance.", "\u201cHello~ Nice to meet you~ This is the Neutral Zone\u2019s second floor! I am Sungjin\u2019s Noona~ Yi Seol-Ah!\u201d", "Hopping around left and right, she repeatedly raised and lowered her arms while rattling her hands.", "\u201cLive~ Live! Live with potions! Live with healing water!\u201d", "Looking closely, she had a bottle in each hand. Every time she waved her hands, Seol Jihu could hear the water churn.", "The way Yi Seol-Ah eagerly danced to the rhythm must have come off as cute, as laughter flew out from the crowd. Next, as one of the spectators clapped lightly, the rest started clapping as well.", "\u201cThank you! Thank you, everyone! I love you!\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah spread her arms out with a beaming smile.", "\u201cDon\u2019t forget to use our Brother and Sister Store a lot~!\u201d", "Of course, she didn\u2019t forget to advertise. Soon, a good chunk of the crowd entered the store and began to look around. The items on display were needed anyway for the missions, and seeing the lively Yi Seol-Ah made them want to buy more to help support the cute younger sister-like girl.", "Seol Jihu had to admit. He was impressed.", "\u2018Who would have thought she was good at something like this?\u2019", "His eyes met Yi Seol-Ah\u2019s as she was wiping off the sweat on her forehead.

Dance with your shoulders~ We\u2019re a family~ Paradise and Valhalla~!\u201d", "Now she was singing a military song.

Yi Seol-Ah was the one singing, but it was Yi Sungjin who was embarrassed for her sake.", "\u2018Well, at least their business is doing fantastic.\u2019", "Seol Jihu smiled bitterly, vowing to never let Yi Seol-Ah enter the Banquet. He had a feeling she would get too absorbed in Stage 1.", "Going back to the main topic, Kim Hannah was in charge of the weapon store right next to the regular store. She was sitting with her legs crossed when she saw Seol Jihu coming in and got up.", "\u201cRepresentative Seol! You\u2019re here!\u201d", "She used polite speech, perhaps judging that this was in public. Seol Jihu spoke as he looked around the dozen or so people checking out the store\u2019s weapons.", "\u201cShould I have come later?\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, we have a lot of part-time workers.\u201d", "Now that she mentioned it, the weapon store had a good number of instructors in it.", "\u201cWith so many of them here, you can\u2019t be getting that many Survival Points, right?\u201d", "\u201cFufu, that\u2019s not true.\u201d", "Kim Hannah put her hand over her waist and smiled.", "\u201cAny points used by the customers who come here on their own belong to me.

It\u2019s purely performance-based.\u201d", "Kim Hannah said firmly before sighing.", "\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s good to finally see your face. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re focused on training, but please show your face every once in a while.\u201d", "The head manager of the Neutral Zone had little duties. It wasn\u2019t that they had nothing to do, but Seol Jihu had already delegated those tasks to Kim Hannah.", "\u2018If she\u2019s saying this despite that\u2026\u2019", "It didn\u2019t look like she was complaining about the work being difficult, so there must be a matter she needed the representative\u2019s approval on.", "\u201cAlright, tell me. What\u2019s up?\u201d", "\u201cYou see, I wanted to ask if you had any thoughts of recruiting additional members. Of course, among the Neutral Zone\u2019s newbies.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cI thought none of the Contracted or Invited are from us besides Miss Eun Yuri.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. But it isn\u2019t as if someone has to be our Contracted or Invited for us to recruit them.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared at Kim Hannah for a while as he thought of a past experience.", "\u2018Someone from a cartel\u2026 and Oh Minyoung, was it?\u2019", "Looking back, there were definitely people who could not form contracts with organizations after the Neutral Zone. Although he was too busy at that time from Sinyoung pressuring him to really notice, what mattered was that a contract could be transferred if both organizations agreed.", "\u201cWhy do you ask? Did you find a second Eun Yuri?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026No.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled bitterly.", "\u201cI apologize, but it isn\u2019t so common for Irregulars to appear. Survivors like Representative and Miss Eun Yuri might not even appear in a hundred Neutral Zone openings.\u201d", "Hearing this, Seol Jihu asked without feeling a bit uncomfortable.", "\u201cThen?\u201d", "\u201cTo be straightforward with you, I am looking to recruit Mister Park Woori and Mister Yoo Yeolmu.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was surprised hearing the two names.", "\u201cYou know them?\u201d", "\u201cIs that not obvious? While Representative was focused on Miss Eun Yuri, I was focused on observing those two.\u201d", "Kim Hannah cleared her throat.", "\u201cFirst, Mister Park Woori is someone I would like to personally recruit. His abilities are nothing special, but his wits are excellent. He is nimble and has good situational judgment. I\u2019d like to try raising him.\u201d", "She was saying she wanted to reinforce the intelligence team.", "Seol Jihu whistled. To be noticed by the picky Kim Hannah\u2026 He began to see Park Woori differently.", "\u2018He was quite daring unlike how he looked.\u2019", "Kim Hannah must be holding him in high regard for noticing the conditions of Homunculus\u2019 attack and delivering the bag to Seol Jihu at the end of the Tutorial\u2019s second stage.", "\u201cAs for Mister Yoo Yeolmu\u2014 Valhalla\u2019s members gave him favorable evaluations.\u201d", "\u201cOh, they did?\u201d", "\u201cYes. They\u2019ve been praising him as a natural Warrior for having a simple personality and withstanding Master Jang Maldong\u2019s training without complaints. Miss Chung Chohong and Mister Richard Hugo have been especially vocal in praising him.\u201d", "\u201cMister Park Woori and Mister Yoo Yeolmu, huh. Would the organizations they\u2019re contracted to hand them over so easily?\u201d", "\u201cThere is no way to be sure, but I believe there is a good chance. You see, forces that can afford to buy stamps don\u2019t get hung up on Archers and Warriors.\u201d", "Indeed, the two men weren\u2019t anything special just based on their classes. From an organization\u2019s perspective, rather than investing time into a resource that they were already abundant in, it might be better to trade them off for stamps and a suitable amount of money and aim for the next opportunity.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t think for long. It would be great if it worked but would be fine even if it didn\u2019t.", "He nodded his head in agreement.", "\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it.\u201d", "\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d", "Kim Hannah replied knowing that she was the only one suitable for this job.

It was to secure a bridgehead occupied by Sprites. The core of this mission lied in how fast they could break through the structures interspersed on the bridge while minimizing loss. This was because Sprites were strong in long-ranged attacks but unusually weak in close-ranged combat.", "However, the six people did not cross the bridge.", "Because they had a Magician.", "In truth, they have been doing all missions in pretty much the same way. They would wait until Eun Yuri completed her spell and attacked first, then the other five members would take care of the remaining monsters.", "This also meant that Eun Yuri was a far superior Magician than Odelette Delphine, albeit limited to the Neutral Zone. In fact, the density and range of mana that Eun Yuri could currently command far surpassed what Odelette Delphine could do when she was in the Neutral Zone with Seol Jihu.", "Park Woori stood guard against the Sprites that were starting to get noisy and glanced at Eun Yuri, who was moving her mouth and hands at the same time.", "\u2018Twice\u2026 no, four times?\u2019", "If this scene was from a video, the speed at which Eun Yuri\u2019s mouth was moving made it seem like only her lips were moving at increased speed.", "\u201c\u2014\u2014. \u2014\u2014\u2014. \u2014\u2014. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014.\u201d", "She seemed to be chanting a spell the way she was murmuring quickly, but Park Woori couldn\u2019t hear a single word no matter how hard he focused.", "He had a feeling that this had something to do with one of her skills. After all, the speed at which Eun Yuri completed spells improved drastically on the seventh-week mark.", "@&[email\u00a0protected]!&$&.", "As Eun Yuri got closer to completing her spell, the opposite end of the bridge got louder. As Sprites could use minor magic, they were reacting sensitively to the flow of mana they could feel from the other side of the bridge.", "They must have judged that they could not leave it be as over half of the Sprites flew up.", "\u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu, who was standing at the head of the group shouted as he held up his large shield.", "At the same time, Eun Yuri\u2019s spell halted. She had finished her high-speed chanting. Eun Yuri\u2019s closed eyes slowly headed to the sky.

A voice imbued with virile mana burst out. She had used one of Roselle\u2019s signature ultimate moves \u2014 Final Solo \u2014 which amplified the power of the user\u2019s spell by imbuing it with the user\u2019s will when they shouted a keyword.", "As Eun Yuri\u2019s chant echoed out, so did her mana-imbued voice. The Sprites preparing to attack from the sky trembled. However, it was far too late. The wave of cold energy spreading through the voice had already gone past them and was resounding far and wide.", "The Sprites that were hit by the wave got covered with white frost and began to \u2018freeze\u2019 quite literally. The team cheered as they saw the Sprites fall to the ground after having their wings frozen.", "This wasn\u2019t the end.

We can\u2019t miss this opportunity\u2014\u201d", "The moment she gave out a command to charge forward\u2014 Pzzt! Pzzzzt!

The five people only had to take care of the other unmoving targets.", "While finishing off the Sprites one by one, Park Woori tilted his head.", "\u2018Strange.\u2019", "The usual Eun Yuri would have saved a spell for an emergency. But for some reason, she went all out today without holding back. It was as if she was venting her frustration at the Sprites.", "Park Woori turned back curiously, then made a surprised face. Eun Yuri, who was slowly walking over the bridge, found a Sprite and ran up to it. Although the Sprite was already dead, she nudged it a couple of times before kicking it like a soccer ball with a frustrated face.", "Seeing the Sprite\u2019s head fly into the distance, Park Woori suddenly felt pity for the poor creature.", "Soon, the scene warped.

We\u2019re finally done!\u201d", "The Priest clenched her fist after confirming the paper hanging on the second row of the mission board vanish. With this, they had completed all the missions they could do.", "The only one that was left was the Impossible difficulty mission.
