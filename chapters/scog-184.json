It was really a hellish week. I was only tasked with taking care of minor chores, but just being here and seeing the situation develop had me exhausted.

She pushed the hood down, then stretched her arms out.", "\u201cNot only did we confirm the perishing of Undying Diligence, but we also confirmed Unsightly Humility\u2019s use of Divinity Manifestation. Driving the Parasite army towards destruction on top of all of this\u2026 it is more than worth to use the Elixeer for a human who achieved such ridiculous feats. The value in keeping him alive is immeasurable. This is the unanimous decision of the Federation, including the Beastmen Alliance.\u201d", "She spoke with her voice a tone lower. Seol Jihu immediately realized that she was imitating someone from the Federation.", "\u201cAnd?\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah nodded her hooded head and crossed her arms.", "\u201cWe thank you for preparing his body to accept the Elixeer. The treatment went smoothly because of that. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for you all, but we\u2019ve also done everything we can to the best of our abilities. Whether this human can wake up or not now depends entirely on his own willpower.\u201d", "\u201cAnd?\u201d", "Hearing this, Yi Seol-Ah dropped her arms and tilted her head up.", "\u201cIn any case, what the Federation couldn\u2019t do after detonating thousands of Thunders over the course of 10 years, unifying the power of five races, and shedding unimaginable amounts of blood, a human who has only been in Paradise for less than a year managed to accomplish in just a single battle\u2026 it\u2019s incredible, no matter how many times I think about it.

He put on a forced smile.", "\u201cYeah, thanks for telling me.\u201d", "While he wasn\u2019t sure, he guessed that he fell into a coma after the Federation finished their treatment. For 15 weeks, he had remained in a comatose state with only a sliver of his consciousness awake.", "Thinking about it this way, he felt like waking up so early was in fact a stroke of fortune. After all, he\u2019d heard that a comatose patient could stay unconscious for dozens of years.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Okay!

As a result of Yi Seol-Ah running around, screaming at the top of her voice, people barged in before the sun even came up.", "Consequently, other than the time Jang Maldong spent to take the needles out of his body and the time Seo Yuhui spent to examine him, he had to hear the same words over and over again from early in the morning until the sun hung in the middle of the sky.", "\u2018I\u2019m beat\u2026.\u2019", "Even a praise got tiring after hearing it three or four times.", "He was initially touched by everyone\u2019s caring words, but by the time noon rolled around, the feeling had vanished completely. Moreover, his body, which had just now recovered its senses, was screaming from exhaustion.", "But still, he couldn\u2019t just kick out the people who came all the way here to visit him. He was really caught between a rock and a hard place.", "\u201cToot, toot\u2014! Carpe Diem\u2019s leader, Seol the War Hero, has returned!

Or the eighth?", "Teresa had looked down at him fixedly before drawing her face close and getting their noses to touch. Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know what she was doing at first since he couldn\u2019t feel a thing. But when her nose touched him the fourth time, he finally realized that she was kissing him.", "Setting aside how dumbfounded he always got, he wondered what she was always murmuring while kissing him.

Why was she asking about that?", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cA rubbish title was added as my alias recently. I developed a habit of checking it every day thanks to a certain someone, and the day I came here\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cW-What alias?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu asked in a fluster\u2026", "\u201c\u2026Who knows?\u201d", "Agnes\u2019s voice grew deeper. She slowly adjusted her glasses with her middle finger. Seeing a sharp light flashing from the lenses, Seol Jihu gulped.", "In truth, he had all sorts of thoughts while he was lying in bed. After all, that was the only thing he could do.", "One time, when he was bored out of his mind, he created a song that went, \u2018Ting~ Ting, ting, ting~ Tang~ Tang, tang, tang~ Ting, ting, tang, tang, frying pan butt!\u2019 Although he sang this multiple times, he couldn\u2019t muster up the courage to confess.", "\u201cWell, I have no clue.\u201d", "So, he played dumb.", "\u201cHm\u2026 got it.\u201d", "Agnes was clearly suspicious, but she must have considered his status as a patient as she quietly backed off.", "Next, just as Seol Jihu and Teresa both breathed a sigh of relief while hearing Agnes say, \u201cDamn it. Then who was it?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s time! The visiting hours end now.\u201d", "Chak! A clap rang out.", "Seo Yuhui had stepped in, seeing how tired Seol Jihu was. When she added that a thorough check-up was needed just to be sure, people began to leave quickly, just like water during a low tide.", "Of course, there were people who pretended to be deaf and stayed, like Teresa and Chohong.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have a fever\u2026.

Is there anything noteworthy, like lowered physical level?\u201d", "\u201cMy stats have all gone down, but it says it\u2019s temporary, not permanent. I think it will go back once I\u2019m fully recovered.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m glad. I guess there\u2019s a reason why the Elixeer is considered a treasure.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui breathed a sigh of relief, then sighed bitterly. The fact that his Status was like this even after receiving such a powerful treatment meant that the Elixeer had used all of its energy to heal him.", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anywhere? Any uncomfortable areas?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m a bit hungry, I guess.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips and stared at the get-well presents stacked next to his bed. When he saw a soft-looking bread and reached out to grab it, Seo Yuhui quickly snatched his hand mid-air.", "\u201cNo. Your stomach must be contracted right now. You\u2019ll get a stomach ache if you eat something wrong.\u201d", "\u201cI think just one should be okay\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s first clean up your stomach with saltwater, then eat porridge.

Lie down comfortably.\u201d", "Seol Jihu got down on his back. He felt like he knew what Seo Yuhui was going to do.", "Seo Yuhui had not simply been feeding him nutritional supplements and wiping his body while he was in a coma. No, her care had gone beyond the usual simple and general care-giving.", "When a body lay still for an extended period of time, it naturally grew weaker. Seo Yuhui had considered this point and worked out Seol Jihu\u2019s body to prevent his muscles and limbs from getting stiff.", "\u201cRelax your body.\u201d", "What she was doing now was something similar \u2014 chiropractic.", "Every time Seo Yuhui skillfully twisted a joint or a muscle, Seol Jihu\u2019s bones let out electrifying screams.", "\u2018Agh, that feels good.\u2019", "\u201cYou\u2019re a doctor, Noona?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I just have a license in physical therapy. Can you cross your arms over your chest and raise just your upper body?\u201d", "Seol Jihu obediently did as she said.", "Seo Yuhui firmly embraced Seol Jihu\u2019s back from the front, then slowly pushed his upper body down. And when she put more strength into her arms just before Seol Jihu\u2019s back touched the bed\u2014", "Dududuk!", "Seol Jihu moaned from the pleasant pain springing up from his shoulder blade and joint. He felt like the knotted muscles in his body were getting untangled in an electrifying way.", "But there was something that felt even better.", "\u2018Ah\u2026.\u2019", "The warmth he felt on his face was truly cozy enough to make him shudder.

Seo Yuhui made a troubled smile before gently petting Seol Jihu\u2019s head.", "Chohong and Teresa, who refused to leave previously, glared fiercely at the patient and doctor. They even coughed loudly, announcing that they were still in the room.", "Still, the man and woman acted as though they were in a world of their own.", "\u201cUm, Miss Seo Yuhui, are you sure that this is part of the treatment? Which treatment requires you to touch his butt like that? I didn\u2019t think you were like that. I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d", "A fierce protest immediately broke out.", "\u201cHey, you, get your face outta there. Don\u2019t you know that\u2019s rude, even if it\u2019s irresistible\u2014 hup!\u201d", "Chohong blocked her mouth in the middle of her speech. However, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t catch this slip of the tongue and turned his gaze.", "\u201cIrresistible?\u201d", "He asked, still clinging on.", "Hearing this, Seo Yuhui said she\u2019d bring the porridge and tried to squirm out. But Seol Jihu held on to her even tighter, not wanting to let go.", "After a small tussle, Seo Yuhui raised the white flag and came clean.", "\u201cLifeforce?\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah had not told him about the Ceremony, so this news came as a surprise.", "\u201cN-No way. Then\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d", "Because Seol Jihu looked like he was ready to dig through a tunnel again, Seo Yuhui shook her head.", "\u201cI already recovered. I have no trouble carrying out my daily activities.\u201d", "She wasn\u2019t lying, technically speaking. She had just cut out a lot of the important parts and told the bare minimum. If she came out honest, it was likely that Seol Jihu would be racked by guilt.", "\u201cIt was a bit dangerous at one point\u2026 but you heard that the Federation treated me too, right?\u201d", "\u201cI did\u2026 but still, your lifeforce?\u201d", "Seol Jihu continued.", "\u201cI\u2019m worried your lifespan\u2019s gone down\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui couldn\u2019t help but laugh, seeing how cute this question was.", "Seol Jihu stared at the giggling Seo Yuhui dazedly.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like that at all. I\u2019ll say this again. I\u2019m fine. You\u2019re the one who has to be careful.\u201d", "\u201cMe?\u201d", "She stopped her laughter, then placed her hand on Seol Jihu\u2019s head with an ambiguous expression.", "\u201cAccepting someone else\u2019s lifeforce isn\u2019t easy. For example\u2026 right, consider someone who was rushed to the emergency room from loss of blood. Do you think he\u2019ll wake up just because he received a blood transfusion?\u201d", "Shake, shake.", "\u201cRight? The blood has to circulate through the patient\u2019s veins and become his. It\u2019s the same with lifeforce. It\u2019s doing its job for now, but for it to get used to your body and become a part of you\u2026 I think it will take quite a bit of time. There might be unintended side-effects in the meanwhile.\u201d", "\u2018Side-effects?\u2019", "\u201cDon\u2019t you have the urge to cling to me?\u201d", "Seol Jihu flinched. How did she know?", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be embarrassed. That\u2019s one of the side-effects. Since the lifeforce inside you originally belongs to me, it is instinctively trying to get back to me and making your body be attracted to me in the process.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. He understood what she meant, but looking back, he had experienced a similar urge even before he received her lifeforce.", "\u2018What happened then?\u2019", "\u201cSo if you have this urge, don\u2019t suppress it and let it be. It might take some time, but it\u2019s better to let this side-effect disappear naturally. If you keep suppressing it, we don\u2019t know how it will change\u2026 okay?\u201d", "I see. There\u2019s no choice then.", "Murmuring inwardly, Seol Jihu pretended to be deep in thought before letting out a deep sigh. Then, he tried his best to put on a reluctant look before opening his mouth.", "\u201cSorry, because of me\u2026.\u201d", "Although that was what his mouth said, his body was more honest.", "After all\u2026", "\u2018Finally!\u2019", "He now had a justifiable reason.", "Just like the saying, after a storm comes a calm, he felt like the horrible experiences he had during the war were being washed away.", "\u201cNo, you don\u2019t know how grateful I am that you woke up.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui tightly embraced Seol Jihu and murmured.", "\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alive. Really\u2026.\u201d", "She even put her cheek on his head and gently caressed it.", "Two pairs of eyes examined the embracing man and woman from top to bottom.", "Chohong, who was already sending them a less-than-pleasant look, snorted.", "\u201cHaigooo~\u201d", "Teresa opened her mouth too with a what-the-hell-is-this kind of face.", "\u201cFwuuuuck.\u201d"]}
