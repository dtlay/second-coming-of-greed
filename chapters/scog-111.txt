{"cid": "111", "title": "Chapter 111. The Reason She is Here (2)", "content": ["By the time Seol Jihu got a hold of himself, Kim Hannah and Jang Maldong were talking merrily.", "\u2014Sometimes, I even wake up at night, worrying if he\u2019s eating or wearing clothes properly.", "\u201cI understand. Participating in the rescue mission without telling you was that brat\u2019s fault, 100 percent.\u201d", "\u2014It\u2019s the same with the Banquet. He can go after he gains more experience and strength. It hasn\u2019t even been a year since he entered Paradise, yet he\u2019s always dying to go to places filled with life-threatening danger\u2026. Am I worrying about him too much?", "\u201cOf course not. He is your contract partner. I agree with you fully. But, as someone who\u2019s instructed him for the past month, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to say.", "\u2014Oh?", "Kim Hannah shrunk back a bit, cosplaying as a surprised, innocent girl when she was really a sly fox.", "\u2014You instructed him personally, Master Jang? Then, could you have been\u2026 at the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain?", "\u201cYou knew?\u201d", "\u2014So that\u2019s why his face was\u2026. Ah, of course, I do! It\u2019s the home mountain of High Rankers!", "\u201cHaha, home mountain, is it? That\u2019s very flattering.\u201d", "\u2014No, no, I\u2019m being serious.", "Kim Hannah smiled modestly. Seol Jihu followed his instincts and brought a paper bag up to his mouth.", "While the young man barfed quietly in the background, Jang Maldong convinced her with a calm voice. When he told her his initial plan of making him an Archer who would support the team from the back, and have him leave during Stage 2, Kim Hannah nodded her head in agreement.", "\u201cBut this brat stubbornly refused to take on the role of an Archer. He said he wanted to be a Warrior no matter what.\u201d", "\u2014Oh, my, my. So you just let him be?", "\u201cI was angry at first. So I took him to the Huge Stone Rocky Mountain under two conditions.\u201d", "\u2014Conditions?", "\u201cI told him I\u2019d kick him out of the team if he couldn\u2019t keep up with my training, and even if he passed, I said he would be banned from participating in the Banquet if he didn\u2019t meet my expectations.\u201d", "Kim Hannah narrowed her eyes and glanced to the side. She saw Seol Jihu with his face shoved into a paper bag filled with vomit.", "\u2018He actually threw up? That bastard!\u2019", "Kim Hannah was just about to grit her teeth but quickly went back to managing her expression.", "\u201cI wanted to teach him a lesson, but I actually ended up taking a blow. He kept up like a madman with an unwavering spirit.\u201d", "A contemplating look flashed on Kim Hannah\u2019s face. Jang Maldong cleared his throat. \u201cThis old man\u2019s talked too much. Sorry for bothering you.\u201d", "He maintained a polite and courteous tone the entire time. He might be a tiger during training sessions, but he always maintained a level of respect with those he wasn\u2019t familiar with.", "\u2014N-No, not at all.", "Kim Hannah didn\u2019t know what to do when an old man dozens of years older than her treated her with such respect. Seol Jihu studied Jang Maldong carefully, and it didn\u2019t seem like he was lying even a tiny bit.", "Soon, Jang Maldong tapped on Seol Jihu\u2019s shoulders before walking out of the door.", "\u2014Whew.", "Kim Hannah exhaled as if the meeting just now took ten years off her life. Seol Jihu stared fixedly into the crystal.", "\u2014I guess I don\u2019t have a choice. He\u2019s not someone who would say something like that without a reason\u2026. You can go. Just be careful, okay?", "She gave her consent, but when the young man continued to stare at her, her neck flushed red.", "\u2014Don\u2019t stare at me so much. He\u2019s my grandfather\u2019s age. Plus, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m always irritated and itching for an argument.", "\u201c\u2026Right.\u201d Seol Jihu responded with a wry smile.", "\u2014But throwing up wasn\u2019t called for.", "Kim Hannah revealed a bitter smile, and then loosened the buttons around her collars.", "\u2014Anyways, thanks.", "\u201cFor what?\u201d", "\u2014Miss Seo Yuhui and now Master Jang. I got to meet two of Paradise\u2019s legends, thanks to you. You never know what new connections someone might bring, huh.", "\u201cIs that something to thank me for?\u201d", "\u2014Of course! There\u2019s a huge difference between being complete strangers and being strangers who\u2019ve talked with each other once or twice.", "Since she put it that way, it did seem to be the case. Seol Jihu regained his calm and smiled.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re grateful, then buy me dinner.\u201d", "\u2014Dinner?", "\u201cLunch works too. You see, I\u2019ll be dropping by Scheherazade tomorrow.\u201d", "\u2014Why?", "\u201cI need to buy new equipment. I hear Scheherazade has the best quality goods, and they also have the biggest auction house.\u201d", "\u2014That\u2019s true, but\u2026. Hm, wait. You said you\u2019re a Level 3 now, right?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu replied, \u2018Yes\u2019, Kim Hannah rolled her eyes as if she was mulling over an important matter. Soon, she murmured, \u201cI guess it\u2019s okay\u201d, before opening her mouth.", "\u2014Fine. I benefited thanks to you, and it can also serve as a celebration. I\u2019ll be generous. Stay there and wait.", "\u201cStay here?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu asked for a clarification, Kim Hannah winked.", "\u2014You\u2019ll find out in two days.", "*", "Two days later.", "While Seol Jihu was busy reading a book he had borrowed from the library about the Banquet, a package arrived in Carpe Diem\u2019s office. The sender was Kim Hannah, and once Seol Jihu confirmed the contents of the package, he jumped in surprise.", "He could see parts of an armor stacked on top of each other. The first thing to catch his attention was a brigandine with a golden lining. It came with a gorget to protect his neck and a cuirass to protect his chest. The design of the armor boasted an easy assembly, and he could tell from it that it was made to be comfortable.", "He also saw a small chainmail to wear underneath. It was a bit longer than the one he had bought in the Neutral Zone, and the chains were made out of an unknown white metal rather than steel.", "That wasn\u2019t all. There was also a high-quality ivory-colored leather jacket, reddish-brown leather pants, and brown boots with strings.", "After seeing the five items, Seol Jihu dropped his jaw in astonishment. Although he wasn\u2019t knowledgeable about equipment, he could tell even at a glance that these items were worth well over dozens of silver coins.", "The chainmail and the brigandine looked especially extraordinary. He guessed they must be at least several hundred silver coins.", "\u2018She didn\u2019t need to go this far\u2026.\u2019", "He might have been thinking so, but he was already putting them on with a happy smile on his face. Since he got high-quality equipment without spending a single silver coin, how could he not be ecstatic?", "Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to call her to say thanks.", "*", "Four days before the spawn of the Banquet\u2019s entrances, Kazuki visited the office.", "\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201d", "There was only one reason Kazuki would be apologizing. He had to have failed in recruiting a Priest.", "The existence of a Priest was a life-or-death factor in an expedition. Since the Banquet was especially volatile and unpredictable, having a healing Priest was an absolute must.", "The fact that they hadn\u2019t been able to find a Priest meant that they needed to reconsider participating in the Banquet.", "\u201cLooks like Tsuji Yuki is serious about this.\u201d", "Jang Maldong mumbled. Kazuki neither denied nor confirmed the statement, but his stiff face was laced with cold rage.", "\u201cI hit up my contacts in Haramark as well as other cities, but\u2026.\u201d", "Kazuki was angry to the point that he couldn\u2019t even finish his sentence. Unsurprisingly, an Archer of Kazuki\u2019s caliber had many connections. It didn\u2019t make any sense for him to not know a Priest or two.", "If he couldn\u2019t find anyone despite this\u2026.", "\u201cOther cities too?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Almost as if they matched words beforehand, all of them told me that they were joining another team.\u201d", "Then it only made sense to believe that the Japan Business Federation had obstructed them.", "\u201cHaa.\u201d", "Jang Maldong shook his head with a sigh. It was unfortunate, but it was the unwritten rule of Paradise to not interfere in internal feuds. The Japan Business Federation was likely unhappy with Carpe Diem for forming a team with Kazuki.", "In any case, they were left with two choices - to give up on the Banquet or to have Carpe Diem find a Priest.", "The Japan Business Federation had no justification to interfere in Carpe Diem\u2019s activities. But the problem was that neither Hugo nor Chohong had any connections with a Priest.", "Jang Maldong had retired from Paradise in the past, so he didn\u2019t want to involve himself in outside problems. Of course, he could find someone if he really wanted to, but he wasn\u2019t sure what the other party would request from him.", "In the end, everyone\u2019s gaze fell on one person.", "\u201cSeol.\u201d Hugo carefully opened his mouth. \u201cCan you ask Maria?\u201d", "\u201cMaria Yeriel?\u201d", "When Kazuki asked back, Hugo nodded his head.", "\u201cSeol recruited her personally for the mission in Ramman Village.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m fine if it\u2019s her. She\u2019s kind and skilled.\u201d Jang Maldong nodded his head in agreement.", "Kazuki\u2019s eyes also gleamed. \u201cSeol, please, I\u2019m ready to clutch at straws.\u201d", "\u2018Maria is\u2026 kind?\u2019 Seol Jihu tilted his head before making a troubled expression.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to ask her, but\u2026.\u201d He blurred the end of his sentence and then shook his head. \u201cI doubt she\u2019ll agree.\u201d", "In the previous mission, she had gone through life-threatening danger and lost her precious artifact. The image of Maria crying and declaring she would never follow him again was still vivid in his mind.", "Kazuki continued as if that didn\u2019t matter.", "\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that you\u2019re our only hope. I have something I could try out, but I\u2019d still like you to try just in case.\u201d", "Just trying wasn\u2019t difficult. He was merely hesitant because he knew how Maria would react. Of course, he knew he wasn\u2019t in a position to just sit back and do nothing, so he reluctantly agreed.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s your other plan?\u201d", "Hearing Chohong\u2019s question, Kazuki looked out the window.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go see her.\u201d", "\u201cWho? \u2026Ah.\u201d", "Chohong immediately thought of someone.", "\u201cWell, since she raised you, she at least won\u2019t ignore you.\u201d", "\u201cIt was only for a short time, but she helped me greatly.\u201d", "Kazuki looked unwilling but in an anxious kind of way.", "\u201cI\u2019ll explain our circumstance to her and ask for help. It might be shameless of me to do so, but we\u2019re in no position to be picky.\u201d", "Kazuki took out a crystal ball from his pocket.", "\u201cTell me how it goes with Maria, Seol.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I\u2019ll let you know right away.\u201d", "Seol Jihu got up from his seat and took the crystal.", "*", "Same time, different place.", "\u201cAchoo!\u201d", "Maria sneezed loudly in her temple room.", "\u201cFucking hell\u2026. Why is it so cold?\u201d", "She sniffled as she held her body close at the sudden chilliness.", "*", "Seol Jihu went to the temple of Luxuria and visited Maria.", "\u201cI refuse.\u201d", "Meeting her wasn\u2019t hard, but neither was her answer.", "\u201cBecause I, Maria, care more about my life than money. What\u2019s money worth if you die and can\u2019t use it? Right?\u201d", "She put her hands on her hips and declared commandingly. Seol Jihu reined in his desire to poke her baby fat puffed cheeks and opened his mouth.", "\u201cMiss Maria.\u201d", "\u201cShut up. Leave before I call someone. Shoo!\u201d", "Maria shooed him away as if she wanted nothing more to do with him. Of course, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t come without a plan. He had brought the crucifix artifact he\u2019d gotten from the royal family\u2019s storage to use as bait. However, an unexpected problem came up.", "The same crucifix artifact was hanging on Maria\u2019s neck. It seemed that she somehow found an identical one.", "Seeing that Seol Jihu had no plans to leave, Maria dropped her head.", "\u201c\u2026Well, I acknowledge that your team is very strong. Since two of the best teams in Haramark joined hands, it really can\u2019t be anything but strong.\u201d", "\u201cThen why?\u201d", "\u201cDo you even need to ask? The Japan Business Federation. The Triads. I hate getting involved in complicated relationships. I\u2019m more than happy to watch a fire burn from the other side of the river, but I would never jump in myself.\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know what to say since she was being so adamant.", "\u2018I guess I don\u2019t have any other choice.\u2019", "In the end, he decided to give up on persuading her. The Maria he knew was a Priest who moved solely based on profit. It seemed he needed to change his strategy.", "Seol Jihu put his hand into his pocket.", "\u201cAnyways, that\u2019s enough from you.\u201d", "Clang! The sound of clashing metallic objects rang out. Maria paused and glanced up. When she saw Seol Jihu placing a pouch on the table, she smirked.", "\u201cWow~ You\u2019re funny\u2026. Fine, I\u2019ll take a look since you insist.\u201d", "She opened the pouch slightly, and one corner of her mouth twisted up.", "\u201cTen silver coins? You\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d", "She tilted her head up and crossed her arms and legs.", "\u201cI followed you to Ramman Village for 15 silver coins, though I ended up getting tricked. Anyways, this is not even close to getting me to follow you to the\u2014\u201d", "Clang! Before she could even finish her speech, a second pouch was placed on the table. Maria narrowed her eyes.", "\u201c20\u2026. Haa, just leave while I\u2019m still being nice.\u201d", "Clang!", "\u201cYou know\u2026. Here\u2019s some vodka. Drink this and get your mind working straight. I\u2019m not trying to bargain with you. I really don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d", "Clang!", "40 silver coins. Maria bit her cherry-like lips.", "Clang!", "Another attack came in. Maria lifted her butt half-way before quickly putting it back down. She pressed down on her temples and groaned.", "\u201cKeuk. If only I didn\u2019t blow all my money to get this artifact\u2026. Ah, n-no, don\u2019t be tempted!\u201d", "She took several breaths before resolving herself with firm determination.", "\u201cIt\u2019s obvious how this will play out. I\u2019m going to end up rolling in the mud again. I\u2019d be a fool if I got tricked a second time!\u201d", "Seeing Maria\u2019s eyes tremble, Seol Jihu snorted and threw another pouch.", "Clang!", "Maria screamed in shock, \u201cS-Stop! What are you doing!?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAre you crazy!? How can you spend dozens of silver coins to hire a Priest who\u2019s not even a High Ranker!!?\u201d", "Clang!", "\u201cY-You devil! You\u2019re a devil!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cDo what you want! You think I\u2019ll give in with just this?\u201d", "Clang!", "\u201cAH!\u201d", "Maria yelped before shooting up with an angry look. Then\u2026.", "\u201cOppa~!\u201d", "She scurried up close and grabbed all eight pouches before holding them close in her embrace.", "\u201cHow can you throw money like this? Poor babies!\u201d", "From an unwelcome guest to a devil, then from a devil to an oppa, all it took was 80 silver coins.", "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with you.\u201d", "\u201cHmph! I hate you, Oppa!\u201d", "She even began to talk with a nasal voice. Seol Jihu happily watched the crazed Maria rubbing her cheeks on the pouches.", "\u2018Money is nice, huh.\u2019", "Although he had to use 80 silver coins, he hardly considered it a loss. He had well over 900 \u2018silver\u2019 coins and even had many priceless items like a piece of gold and the Proof of Castitas. Plus, he ended up saving the crucifix.", "After successfully recruiting Maria, Seol Jihu left the temple and took out the communication crystal he got from Kazuki.", "\u2014Seol?", "\u201cMister Kazuki.\u201d", "As soon as he picked up, Seol Jihu drew a V-sign with his hands.", "\u201cI recruited her.\u201d", "\u2014I recruited someone.", "The young man and the man both wore dazed expressions."]}
