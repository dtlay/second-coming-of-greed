But since he almost died, he couldn\u2019t help but resent the Nine Eyes a little bit. ", "Flone was looking in the direction of the villa. Seeing her staring endlessly made Seol Jihu feel sad and a little bitter, but he didn\u2019t have the slightest desire of going back inside.", "He would rather throw the camouflage helmet on his head and hide behind a nearby rock.

", "Even when he poured a healing potion down her throat, she didn\u2019t move. ", "Having thought that just cutting the rope was enough, it was only now that he began to give her emergency treatment. Recalling his past experience of learning how to perform CPR, he interlocked his fingers and diligently put pressure on Phi Sora\u2019s chest. ", "But as she showed no signs of breathing again, he pressed down harder and tried mouth-to-mouth.", "[!?] ", "Seol Jihu put his mouth against Phi Sora\u2019s cold lips and blew air into it.", "[Eek\u2026!]", "He could feel Flone tacitly pulling on his hair, but he ignored her and focused on giving CPR.

", "\u2018In a way, I had a slip of the tongue too.\u2019", "At the very least, he felt like he needed to do what he could, to not feel guilty if Phi Sora died.", "He knew killing her painlessly might be easier, but he didn\u2019t want to be that numb to killing yet.

Where are you? Are you alive? Say something!\u201d ", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows.

From Attention Required to Do Not Approach.", "\u2018Fucking hell\u2026.\u2019", "The situation had developed in the worst possible way. ", "Now wasn\u2019t the time to just sit around like this.
