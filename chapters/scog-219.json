Roselle was still frozen with shock plastered all over her face.", "\u201cPrincess, there\u2019s something I want to ask you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu leaned toward Teresa, who was sitting right by him and whispered a question.", "\u201cIs the Empire collapsing that shocking?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Teresa answered without a shred of hesitation.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just humanity. Their magic engineering far surpassed every other race in Paradise, so much so that they weren\u2019t even mildly comparable. Including the native races that are part of the Federation, the Empire reigned over all of Paradise for well over a thousand years.\u201d", "Teresa spoke with strength.", "\u201cA country where the sun never sets. That was the Empire as a nation.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u201cBut\u2026 the invading force is a god\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if the Empire didn\u2019t have gods on their side.\u201d", "Teresa shook her head.", "\u201cEven if the Parasite Queen was stronger than the Empire\u2019s gods, the Empire still fell too quickly. I had a similar reaction when I first heard that the Empire fell. I thought some fool was cracking a joke.\u201d", "\u2018It was that absurd\u2026?\u2019", "Seol Jihu turned to Roselle once again.", "Clang! Ah, the teacup fell and broke.", "\u201cUm\u2026\u201d", "Just as Seol Jihu was about to rekindle the conversation\u2026", "\u201cWait!\u201d", "Roselle quickly pushed her open palm out. She looked extremely anxious.", "\u201cP-Please give me a more detailed explanation\u2026!\u201d", "Perhaps because she had read everyone\u2019s minds, she seemed to be certain that the fall of the Empire wasn\u2019t a lie.", "Seol Jihu looked back at Teresa. When it came to history, it was much better to have someone who had experienced it first-hand to give the explanation.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. Just recall what happened slowly and in-order.\u201d", "Teresa calmly closed her eyes. Seol Jihu observed Roselle\u2019s face during this time, which was rather interesting.", "Shock, doubt, disbelief\u2026 By the end of the imagery, her eyes rolled back to her head.", "Now unmasked, Roselle displayed emotions with rich expressions. The only downside was that most of the emotions she showed were negative.", "Soon\u2026", "\u201cHow foolish!\u201d", "As Teresa opened her eyes, Roselle shot up from her seat. The slender white face reddened like a ripe apple. Then, she turned around before wandering back and forth in the garden.", "\u2018Wait! That action!\u2019", "It happened when someone really didn\u2019t like something. For example, Seol Jihu had done the same thing when Gula gave him his old class name.", "Her eyes narrowed, Roselle wet her lips with her saliva\u2026", "\u201cWhat\u2026 another universe? But still\u2026 Hah!\u201d", "And she muttered while fiddling with her fingers. She even picked up her tray forcefully and slammed it down.", "\u2018Why is she angry?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. He could understand her being taken aback, but Roselle was someone who hated the Empire. He felt like she should be clapping her hands in joy knowing that it had fallen.", "\u201cDamn it! For what reason did I\u2026!?\u201d", "But when he saw her tilting her head back and shaking her tightly-clenched fists, he finally understood.", "Roselle must have waited for hundreds of years for a chance to exact her vengeance. But the target of her vengeance had crumbled like a sandcastle and vanished. The difference between personally exacting vengeance on her sworn enemy and having it done coincidentally must be like the difference between heaven and earth.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t fathom the sense of loss Roselle must be feeling. It wasn\u2019t until 40 minutes later that Roselle stopped fidgeting and showed signs of calming down.", "During this time, the expedition team shut their mouths and maintained their silence. Roselle was seething so much that they feared she would break something if provoked.", "\u201cHuuuuu\u2014\u201d", "After an earth-shattering sigh, Roselle swept her forehead up in frustration before pausing. Looking at the expedition team sitting awkwardly around the table, she lowered her head in embarrassment.", "\u201cI apologize for my unsightly display.\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s totally fine.\u201d", "Rather than unsightly, her actions were rather funny. Seol Jihu and the rest of the expedition team knew they shouldn\u2019t laugh, but they couldn\u2019t help but find this situation funny.", "\u201cWe should be apologizing for saying something unnecessary\u2026.\u201d", "Roselle shook her head.", "\u201cNo, not at all. I\u2019m glad I found out\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m glad, but\u2026\u201d", "Roselle covered her face with her hands, unable to finish her sentence.", "\u201cEmpire, you son of a gun\u2026\u201d", "She muttered to herself, but everyone clearly heard what she said.", "\u201c\u2026Ah\u2026\u201d", "After a moment, Roselle slowly took her hands off and spoke powerlessly.", "\u201cYou\u2026 You said you were here to take the Rothschear House\u2019s inheritance, yes?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied immediately.", "\u201cPromise of Temperance and a blood-related soul of the Rothschear House\u2026 There\u2019s no room for doubts\u2026 haa\u2026\u201d", "This was already the second time she was sighing. After hesitating for some time, Roselle nodded her head and spoke.", "\u201cBy the name of Roselle La Grazia\u2014 no, I\u2019ll skip the formalities since I\u2019m fuming. For now, let\u2019s go ahead with returning the inheritance.\u201d", "\u2018For now?\u2019", "Just as Seol Jihu was about to raise a question\u2014", "Chak! A clap rang out.", "At the same time, the scenery changed once again. This time, no one was surprised. Everyone fell on their butts because they were transported while they were seated, but no one let out even a tiny groan.", "They seemed to be in the basement of the palace. Although the place was generally dark, there were several stones on the ceiling illuminating the ground, so it wasn\u2019t difficult to see.", "The only problem was that there were countless rooms around them, so much that they couldn\u2019t begin to count. It felt like they were standing in the middle of a maze of doors.", "\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 the Rothschear House\u2019s inheritance\u2026\u201d", "Roselle looked around the doors, then snapped her fingers. Then, something surprising happened. The tens of thousands of doors began to rotate in a clockwise direction before abruptly coming to a stop.", "Looking at a white door at the front, Roselle nodded her head.", "\u201cHere it is. I remember expanding the storage room quite a bit because of the volume of the items.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s expectations went up, hearing that there was a large volume of the items.", "When Roselle walked up and caressed the door, the door opened on its own. Seol Jihu looked on with a beating heart as his eyes tensed up.", "As soon as the door opened, a murky fog flowed out before a multicolored light shot out.", "No one had entered the room and its inside was still invisible, yet a brilliant light illuminated the entire space.", "\u2018Just how much is in there\u2026?\u2019", "The inheritance buried here was the \u2018Spear of the Empire\u2019 and the Rothschear\u2019s secret techniques. There shouldn\u2019t be much gold, yet it was shining so brightly?", "Seol Jihu doubled his efforts in calming his beating heart and stared at Roselle.", "Roselle quietly backed off before gesturing at the room.", "\u201cThis inheritance is yours. You do not need my permission to take it.\u201d", "Several gazes fell on his back. Everyone was clearly eager to go in.", "\u2018This particularly stinging gaze must be Miss Maria\u2019s.\u2019", "\u201cAlright.\u201d", "Seol Jihu wanted to run inside, but he kept himself in check and walked slowly on purpose. Maria\u2019s aroused panting was getting on his nerves, but he forgot about her the moment he entered the room.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "He almost couldn\u2019t breathe.", "A mountain of treasures.", "He couldn\u2019t describe the scene in any other way. Gold, silver, and all sorts of jewels were stacked on top of each other, forming a hill.", "Seol Jihu walked in as though he was entranced and reached out. When he grabbed a handful of riches and then loosened his hand, a colorful waterfall trickled down.", "Tok, tok, tok! Drrrrr\u2026.", "The sound of riches striking the ground enhanced the emotions he was feeling. What shocked him even more was that these weren\u2019t gold coins, but gold eggs. They weren\u2019t the egg-shaped gold nuggets he found at the emperor\u2019s villa, but prettier spherical eggs.", "\u2018My god\u2026.\u2019", "This was meant to only be a fraction of the Rothschear\u2019s wealth. Seol Jihu finally understood why the emperor got so greedy.", "A rectangular glass casket was placed in the middle of the room, and lying inside it was something that was wrapped in a blue cloth.", "Next to it, Seol Jihu could also see a fairly big, faded treasure chest. The symbol engraved onto the side of the chest caught Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes.", "\u2018The Rothschear\u2019s insignia.\u2019", "He recognized it instantly as he had seen it before in historical records.", "That wasn\u2019t all. On one side of the room were ten rectangular wooden chests neatly organized like parcels.", "\u201cWhat a mess. It\u2019s because I never tended to them after I received them\u2026.\u201d", "Following Roselle\u2019s voice, the mountain wiggled.", "Clang, clang!", "Along with the pleasant clattering of riches, gold bars and gold eggs separated themselves from the mountain and moved to the left.", "Swish!", "Next, the various jewels all shot up and moved to the right.", "\u2018A mountain of gold, a mountain of silver, and a mountain of jewels\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu trembled.", "\u201cThis young lady will step aside for a moment.\u201d", "Roselle\u2019s voice rang out. Judging by her cold voice, she still seemed to be in shock. By the time Seol Jihu turned around, Roselle was nowhere to be found.", "Only then did a loud cheer burst out.", "\u201cPIEEEEEEEEEEK!\u201d", "Maria howled and charged into the gold mountain at a frightening speed.", "\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026 it\u2019s real\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cDream\u2026 this must be a dream\u2026.\u201d", "Chohong speechlessly stared at the mountains with her jaw dropped, and Marcel Ghionea rubbed his eyes in doubt.", "\u201cUwoaaaah!\u201d", "Hugo roared.", "\u201cMoooooom!\u201d", "And Teresa searched for her mother before running into Seol Jihu\u2019s embrace.", "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it\u2026.\u201d", "Kazuki muttered in a daze before glancing sideways and asking.", "\u201cDid you know about the inheritance?\u201d", "Seol Jihu pushed the clinging Teresa away and narrowly smiled.", "The expedition team\u2019s minds were all over the place. The three mountains were quite a bit smaller thanks to Roselle cleanly separating the huge mountain, but the expedition team\u2019s shock had not diminished in the slightest.", "Maria, who was lying in the mountain of gold eggs and jamming her mouth with them, rubbed her puffed up cheeks with sparkling eyes.", "\u201cIt was my dream to try this!\u201d", "She then got in a diving pose, catapulted herself into the mountain, then started swimming.", "\u201cArgh, fine!\u201d", "Chohong threw herself at the mountain of jewels. Meanwhile, Hugo was grabbing handfuls of silver and throwing them into the air.", "\u201cUhehehehe!\u201d", "\u201cKuehehehehe!\u201d", "Elated didn\u2019t begin to describe them.", "Haha, hoho.", "Seol Jihu smiled, seeing his overjoyed comrades, and then clapped his hands. Hearing this, everyone flinched and looked back.", "Because of Roselle, they seemed to be conditioned to respond to claps.", "\u201cAh, jeez~\u201d", "\u201cYou surprised me~\u201d", "Normally, they would have thrown a fit at his prank, but the bountiful rewards must have broadened their hearts, as Chohong and Maria both smiled adorably.", "Seol Jihu spoke while laughing.", "\u201cAs you all know, Lady Roselle didn\u2019t seem to be in a good mood.\u201d", "Maria, who was gracefully doing backstrokes in the ocean of gold, abruptly stopped.", "\u201cSince she is exercising courtesy as the master of this palace, we need to do the same as her guests. Don\u2019t be too loud. Let\u2019s get what we came for and hurry back.\u201d", "Seol Jihu could tell at a glance that everyone fully agreed. They had experienced first-hand how absurdly powerful Roselle was. Leaving this place as soon as possible was clearly a thousand times better than staying unnecessarily and potentially offending her.", "Now that they had obtained such unprecedented wealth, they would be too bitter to ascend if they died without spending any of it.", "At last, the expedition team began to bag the riches by category. As Seol Jihu had prepared several large, weight-reducing backpacks, there was no need to worry about not being able to bring them all back.", "Just as everyone was busy stuffing the bags, the ceiling began to tremble faintly.", "Rumble\u2026! Thud\u2026!", "Listening carefully, it sounded like things were breaking and crumbling down. A few members looked up at the ceiling in a daze.", "\u2014Kyaaaak! Kyaaaaaaaak!\u2014FUCK! FUUUUUUCK!", "Screams and heavy curses were fired out loud.", "Seol Jihu, who was in the middle of bagging gold bars and eggs, furrowed his brows and warned solemnly.", "\u201cMaria, didn\u2019t I tell you to quiet down? I understand how happy you are, but you don\u2019t have to curse like it\u2019s your last\u2014\u201d", "\u201cHuh? I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d", "Maria rebutted resentfully as if to ask why he was accusing an innocent person.", "\u2018It wasn\u2019t Miss Maria?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "In any case, the sound subsided, and everyone went back to work. Because of the sheer amount of riches, packing them all up was taking a long time. However, no one uttered a single complaint. In fact, they worked hard not to leave out a single thing.", "\u201cDon\u2019t just stuff them in like they\u2019re rocks on the side of the road. If anyone gets even a single scratch on any of the treasure, expect to get smashed by my mace.\u201d", "Chohong even gave an intimidating warning while laughing.", "\u201cI\u2019m looking. I know I\u2019m not the one to speak, but let\u2019s not fill up the wrong pocket today.\u201d", "Hugo also growled with his eyes lit up.", "Seol Jihu was astonished inwardly. This was the first time he saw the duo so focused and passionate.", "\u2018Master Jang would be overjoyed if they acted the same while training\u2026\u2019", "After the team bagged more than half of the riches, Seol Jihu suddenly felt something poking his side. Teresa was pointing at the door.", "Seol Jihu saw Roselle standing outside the door, watching them quietly. From the way she was staring at him fixedly, Seol Jihu figured she had something to ask.", "Seol Jihu gave the bag in his hand to Teresa, then walked to the door.", "\u201cYou seem to be having fun.\u201d", "\u201cAh\u2026 haha.\u201d", "Seol Jihu laughed awkwardly and studied Roselle\u2019s face. Her eyes were faintly curled up to a smile.", "She seemed to have calmed down a bit.", "\u201cI apologize for leaving so suddenly. What I heard was just too shocking\u2026\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s totally fine. I fully understand.\u201d", "\u201cI thank you for your generosity.\u201d", "Roselle sighed. Then, she looked up with pitiful eyes, like a tragic heroine of a story.", "\u201cI thought about it while watching the serene lake at the silent flower garden.\u201d", "Seol Jihu glanced at Roselle. For some reason, rock crumbs were littering her tiny shoulders. Roselle dusted her shoulders off in a startle.", "\u201cAh, please ignore these. I fell down while staggering.\u201d", "\u201cOh, my.\u201d", "\u201cAnyway.\u201d", "Roselle changed the topic immediately.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you while you are busy, but can you give me some time? It won\u2019t take long.\u201d", "Roselle\u2019s expression lacked the composure it once had and was very serious. Seol Jihu\u2019s intuition told him that Roselle would make another request."]}
