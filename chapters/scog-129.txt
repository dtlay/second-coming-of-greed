", "But the result spoke for itself. All 110 participants had made it out alive. Of course, most of them were injured in some way, but the result was still fantastic. ", "There were two reasons for this success. The first reason was Kazuki\u2019s quick assassination of the Orc Shaman, and the second, more important reason was Seol Jihu defeating the Orc Champion early on. ", "To be precise, they had used the Orcs\u2019 military system against them. When a commander-class Orc fell, the Orcs\u2019 morale plummeted and over half of the Orc Warriors became noticeably weaker.

He was happy that everyone made it out alive, but that was how Stage 2\u2019s atmosphere normally was.

Do you know how hard it was to try not to pay attention? I thought I was gonna die of having all my energy sucked out!\u201d ", "It sounded like Oh Rahee intimidated them more than she needed to.

He forcefully united the 110 people, performed better than expected on the first conquering of the Plaza of Sacrifice, and had all six people return alive from the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish.", "He was 80% of the way there. It would be great if the rest worked out on its own, but Seol Jihu thought there was a low chance of that happening. ", "He realized this just by remembering how Stage 1 progressed. He had persuaded everyone to work together, but after a while, Oh Rahee had suggested that they abandon the Level 3s. ", "Similarly, although things were progressing well now, there was no guarantee that everything would end well. Whether big or small, someone was bound to complain somehow, and Seol Jihu expected at least one more incident to come up. ", "So what could he do to prevent this?

He wasn\u2019t sure whether she couldn\u2019t hear him or if she was ignoring him, but judging by the way she had her arms folded and was walking haughtily, he guessed it was the latter.

She creaked her head to the side frighteningly, and Seol Jihu immediately added, \u201cMISS!\u201d ", "In the next moment, Seol Jihu faced Oh Rahee with a winter storm blowing behind her.

That\u2019s your name, right, Miss Oh Rahee?\u201d ", "\u201cMy last name\u2026 well, I guess you could have heard from Kazuki or someone else. Anyways, you called my name?\u201d ", "\u201cYes.

", "\u2018It spread already?\u2019 ", "\u201cI didn\u2019t do it alone. It was only possible because of my team\u2019s support.\u201d ", "\u201cDoesn\u2019t that go without saying? Who would believe you defeated an Orc Champion alone? Even I am not confident in doing that.\u201d ", "Her tone wasn\u2019t condescending or sneering in any way. That was just how she talked. Her tone was actually more close to being surprised. ", "\u201cHow mysterious\u2026.\u201d", "She murmured to herself while sending strange glances at Seol Jihu.

When she untied the cloth knot, a big, long two-handed axe revealed itself.", "The flower symbol engraved on the axe head harmonized well with the delicate white light flowing down to the butt, giving the weapon a beautiful, sacred look.", "\u201cAn axe?\u201d ", "\u201cHilarious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Oh Rahee looked more than a little disappointed. ", "In Paradise, finding a high-quality weapon or armor was difficult. A part of the reason was the fall of the Empire, but the bigger reason was a severe lack of material caused by the long, drawn-out war. ", "This was the reason the price of equipment jumped by digits every time one leveled up. Furthermore, it was almost impossible to find a weapon suitable for a High Ranker. ", "Oh Rahee would have been ecstatic if she had received a longsword on the same level as this axe; but this couldn\u2019t be helped. After all, Stage 2\u2019s reward was supposed to grant the participants\u2019 wish in a \u2018dissonant\u2019 form.

", "The duo then began to examine the weapon they exchanged. ", "\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t confirm what you got inside?\u201d ", "\u201cI told you. We didn\u2019t say a word to each other.\u201d ", "When Seol Jihu asked, Hugo retorted with an unusual level of concentration. ", "\u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to either\u2026.\u201d Hugo murmured in a daze.", "\u2018Makes sense,\u2019 Seol Jihu thought. Considering how wary they were of each other, asking \u2018Can I see what you got?\u2019 was probably out of the question. ", "In any case, judging by Hugo\u2019s entranced face, it seemed that he liked the axe. ", "It was the same for Oh Rahee. She carefully scrutinized the blood-red rapier emitting an ominous, demonic sword-like aura. From the way the corner of her mouth was curled up, one could tell how satisfied she was.

And even if it was, a trade was fair as long as both sides agreed to it.", "\u201cYour first impression was terrible\u2026 but I\u2019ve been loving everything you do.\u201d ", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Oh Rahee shook her head. Glancing at Hugo, she asked, \u201cOi, you.\u201d", "\u201cHuh?\u201d ", "\u201cHow about it?\u201d ", "Hugo raised both of his thumbs up as if he didn\u2019t even need to think about the answer. ", "\u201cCall!\u201d ", "\u201cGood.\u201d", "The trade had been completed. ", "Oh Rahee spun the rapier in her hand before caressing the blade with her hand and smiling. Hugo ran around while swinging the axe, like a child who had received his Christmas present. ", "Seeing this, the four people who entered the Plaza of the Dissonant Wish with them didn\u2019t sit still. In case someone had an item worth trading for, they began to unwrap their cloth. ", "Then, other people began to gather round. When they saw the rewards the six people received, they couldn\u2019t help but marvel at them.

", "Soon\u2026.", "\u201cUm.\u201d One person swallowed his saliva and asked, \u201cWhen are we selecting the next group of participants?\u201d ", "Hearing this, Seol Jihu grinned with satisfaction.", "*", "The conquering of the Plaza of Sacrifice hastened. ", "The second attempt ended without anyone dying, mainly due to Oh Rahee playing an active role. She killed more enemies than anyone else, and just as one might expect, it wasn\u2019t for an altruistic reason. ", "It turned out that the rapier got stronger and could even restore its user\u2019s stamina by drinking blood. When Seol Jihu found out, he was convinced the rapier was a demonic sword of some sort. ", "In any case, the participants were able to conquer the Plaza of Sacrifice four times that day, and six times the next day. They had progressed more than halfway in just two days.", "And on the sixth night\u2026", "\u201cAmazing.\u201d ", "Kazuki muttered in awe after once again conquering the Plaza of Sacrifice for the sixth time in a single day.", "\u201cI never even imagined something like this on the first day.\u201d", "It was late at night, but dozens of people were gathered together on the grass field. ", "People who were simply watching, people who stopped uninterested traders trying to persuade them, people wondering if they should accept the trade, people haggling\u2026. ", "The entire field was rowdy. The way people were gathered around a large campfire, Kazuki felt like he was looking at a festival. ", "\u201cYou know, I never even considered trading.\u201d ", "It wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t. ", "When Kazuki chuckled, Seol Jihu also laughed.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing amazing, really.\u201d ", "\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is that you considered this possibility in that situation.\u201d ", "Kazuki wasn\u2019t wrong about this. While everyone else was obsessed with sacrificing others to escape, Seol Jihu alone had the idea of turning the Dissonant Wish into the Harmonious Wish. ", "\u201cWell\u2026 I just wondered why this place was given the name Banquet when it first opened.\u201d Seol Jihu continued, \u201cBanquets are supposed to be fun.\u201d", "Originally, a banquet was a feast where many gathered to celebrate or congratulate. Seol Jihu had interpreted this in a Paradisian fashion. ", "\u201cI thought about why Dissonant Wishes were given out\u2026 and I thought it was for people to interact with each other and grow closer\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu blurred the end of his speech before squatting down with a sigh.

I could force the situation thanks to several conditions being met. If our allied team wasn\u2019t the strongest force here\u2026.\u201d ", "In truth, Seol Jihu\u2019s initial plan was to persuade others by telling them about trading. But after seeing how things were working out, he had used a more forceful approach. He had only taken out the trade card afterwards. Otherwise, nothing he said would have held weight.", "Kazuki shrugged his shoulders. ", "\u201cIf you were the eloquent orator type or the cunning strategist type, things might have gone as you expected. The same can be said if you possessed charisma that can mesmerize people at first glance.\u201d ", "\u201cIf there really are people like that \u2014 I\u2019m jealous.\u201d ", "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you were wrong. You don\u2019t need to blame yourself.\u201d ", "\u201cI think so too.\u201d ", "With that, the conversation between the two was cut off. It was Seol Jihu who broke the silence.", "\u201cAnyways, what did you get?\u201d", "\u201cMe? You know\u2026. What about you?\u201d Kazuki asked back while glossing over the answer. ", "Seol Jihu answered clearly, \u201cCompetence.\u201d", "Kazuki\u2019s eyes widened, and he burst into laughter. ", "\u201cHaha. You\u2019re a real piece of work. What kind of wish\u2026.\u201d ", "Suddenly, he tilted his head as if something was strange and muttered seriously.", "\u201cWait, your reward should have been \u2018dissonant\u2019\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t seem like it was.\u201d", "\u201cRight?\u201d", "\u201cCan you show it to me?\u201d ", "Seol Jihu shook his head.

Hey, you dumbass axe. Do you hate me that much?\u201d", "Woong!", "\u201cOh? Wow\u2026. You know, I\u2019m a gentleman when I\u2019m with my partner, but I won\u2019t be one with you. Since you can\u2019t understand with words, I\u2019ll just break you in.\u201d ", "Seol Jihu was watching with interest before he started doubting his eyes.", "Hugo suddenly slammed the axe down and plopped down on it with his dirty butt.

Woong!", "\u201cOoookay. Fine. You better not regret it.\u201d ", "Hugo grit his teeth before suddenly shooting his eyes open. He then let out a short \u201cHaat!\u201d ", "Psh! A bomb detonated.
