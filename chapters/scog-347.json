The End of the War (1)", "content": ["An uproar erupted behind them.", "The Army Commanders looked back one after another and lamented in unison.", "Their worst fear had become a reality.", "The enemies were pursuing them with great tenacity, clearly unperturbed by the Queen\u2019s power.", "Seeing the Fallen Angels and Sky Fairies rushing at her like a swarm of bees, Exploding Patience hurriedly ordered the remaining parasites and corpse army to charge.", "Unsightly Humility also sent out the Death Knights and what was remaining of his undead army.", "They hoped to buy even a little bit of time, but the result was unsatisfactory.", "There were just too few of their forces left to last long enough against the Federation.", "A dazzling golden light flashed, and immediately, a large opening formed in the battle line.", "Exploding Patience frowned when she saw Seol Jihu racing across the battlefield, smashing his way through the center.", "\u201cY-Your Majesty!\u201d", "The Parasite Queen did not answer.", "Exploding Patience looked extremely guilty.

I can understand Medusas, but abandoning all three is\u2026.\u201d", "Exploding Patience hesitated. She knew that mother species were difficult to produce unlike ordinary parasites.", "The upper-ranked and pinnacle-ranked ones were even more so.", "\u2014We don\u2019t have any choice.", "But the Queen was persistent.", "\u2014Carrying the Nests is difficult enough. We can always produce new mother species at a later time. Right now, their presence is getting in the way of our retreat.", "Under the present circumstances, the Queen was right.", "Though still concerned about the aftermath, Exploding Patience chose to remain silent.", "At the same time, she felt frustrated.", "\u2018Even though Her Majesty went to such great lengths to descend\u2026!\u2019", "This proved that the situation they were in was far too dangerous.", "In the end, they had to give up all of their mother species.", "Medusa, Temerators, Reginas, and the others roared furiously as they began to spew out parasites.", "There were quite a lot of them. They had led a huge army into this war from the get-go, and on top of that, the Nests had been giving birth nonstop. Protected in the rear, which had been relatively safe throughout the war, the mother species had naturally increased in number.", "\u201cTsk. They sure are desperate.\u201d", "The white tiger Beastman clicked his tongue.", "The sacrificial parasites and corpses were easy to kill, but the mother species were a different story.", "They were the strongest, the most evolved forms of their ranks. Ganged together, they posed a major threat.", "The parasites they produced also couldn\u2019t be ignored.", "\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d", "White Tiger asked, raising his head slightly.", "\u201cWe can\u2019t break through that.

He thought it better to join forces with the rest of the team and destroy the mother species for good.", "That in itself would be a considerable achievement.", "And so, White Tiger stopped with flexibility unbefitting of his large stature. It was then that he felt the weight of the foot pressing down on his back.", "Toong!", "\u201cHuh?\u201d", "White Tiger unwittingly looked up and was shocked.", "He saw Seol Jihu soaring into the air as if he had been pushed forward by a great force.", "\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "For a moment, White Tiger thought Seol Jihu had lost his mind.", "Medusas alone were over four meters tall, and Temerators and Reginas were twice as tall as Medusas.", "Above all, the sky was full of flying creatures. There was no way Seol Jihu could leap over all of them.", "But then, White Tiger doubted his eyes.", "Seol Jihu was moving in a straight line, not a curve, up towards the sky from where White Tiger stood.", "This meant he wasn\u2019t trying to leap over, but rather\u2014", "Spark!", "At that moment, electricity engulfed Seol Jihu\u2019s entire body as he soared into the sky once again.", "For a brief period of time, Seol Jihu was above all the mother species.", "And as a result\u2026.", "\u201c!\u201d", "He could finally see.", "Nothing else was a concern to him right now.", "He focused all his senses on the Parasite Queen, who was deeply wounded and bleeding.", "The moment he laid eyes on her, just as he reached the apex and was about to fall, in that brief moment, Seol Jihu\u2019s mind went blank.", "He reached the peak of his concentration and fell into a trance.", "[Turn your arm.]", "The only thing he could hear was Jang Maldong\u2019s voice in his head, and his body moved of its own accord.", "[I meant your right arm. Turn it clockwise halfway.]", "He turned his right forearm exactly halfway, bending it back greatly.", "[Start at your feet, then move on to your left arm.]", "He began twisting his left arm, starting from the tip of his finger, and let the movement flow all the way to his right arm.", "His right arm absorbed the rotational force and began moving forward.", "[Now!]", "Seol Jihu opened his eyes wide.", "His right arm quickly shot forward.", "The exploding sensation that began in the palm of his hand spread all over his right arm in an instant.", "His spear felt so flexible that it was like a fish out of water, wriggling away from his hand.", "He\u2019d never thrown a spear in the air before.", "His physical condition wasn\u2019t perfect either.", "Above all, his target was far away.", "But somehow Seol Jihu looked extremely satisfied as he watched the Spear of Purity fly through the air past all the flying creatures.", "\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d", "Even White Tiger, the Beastman King, couldn\u2019t help but admire his comrade\u2019s flawless posture.", "\u2018It\u2019s perfect.\u2019 The king thought unwittingly.", "Whoosh!", "The beam of light, surrounded by electricity, crossed the sky diagonally.", "The distance between the spear and its target quickly approached zero until there was none.", "So the moment the spear pierced exactly where the target was about to pass, the Parasite Queen raised her head, realizing that something was wrong.", "Seol Jihu had poured everything he had into this single shot.", "But the Parasite Queen\u2019s face remained expressionless.", "She appeared calm and composed.", "The reason was that the spear was already there the moment she raised her head.", "Swish!", "It began at the top of her head and went down to her forehead, nose, mouth, and finally to her chin.", "The sharpened spearhead drew a straight line.", "At the same time, intense pain overtook the queen.", "The expressionless face twisted in agony.", "\u2014\u2026\u2026!", "Crimson blood flowed out of the vertical line drawn from the top of her head to the bottom of her chin.", "The Parasite Queen\u2019s face began twitching.", "She finally realized what had happened.", "She was extremely lucky to have raised her head at just the right time.", "If she hadn\u2019t, the spear would\u2019ve penetrated her head and split her in half.", "Thinking of such a possibility\u2014", "\u2014Ah\u2026.", "The Queen felt a chill run down her spine.", "Her head throbbed with pain.", "The Parasite Queen\u2019s eyes dilated with fear as she unwittingly turned her gaze to Seol Jihu.", "Coincidentally, the pain reminded her of the past.", "She recalled the painful and humiliating experience in which her whole body was split in half by a single movement of the Martial God\u2019s sword.", "It was then.", "\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d", "Vulgar Chastity\u2019s voice brought the Queen to her senses.", "But even before she could pull herself together, a new fear struck her.", "The spear, which she thought she had avoided, was coming up again towards her throat.", "The sudden memory of her past had forced her to let her guard down for a moment.
