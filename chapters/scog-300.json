There\u2019s no need to look around. If you hesitate even for a second, arrows will fly in and pierce your neck.\u201d", "Seol Jihu then added that he would have died on the spot if the guardian of the sanctuary didn\u2019t stop to make threats.", "Eun Yuri put the talisman in her mouth with a nervous expression, then held the paper slip for the Impossible difficulty mission in her hands. The other five members swallowed hard and stared at Eun Yuri with their hands on each other\u2019s shoulders.", "The moment Eun Yuri tore the paper slip in half, the members disappeared without a trace. Then, the six reappeared in the plaza in less than five minutes, all sitting on their butts. Every single one of them had their mouths agape, clearly horror-stricken.", "Usually, an earthquake above 5.0 on the Richter scale would be called a powerful earthquake. An earthquake that was just one magnitude higher than another would release 32 times as much energy.", "Hence, a 12.0-magnitude earthquake would go beyond the realm of a natural disaster and reach the realm of an apocalyptic catastrophe. As the group had just witnessed an earthquake of such scale, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if they had pissed their pants.", "While everyone else was at a loss for words, Eun Yuri snapped out of her daze hearing an alarm. She had received a message saying that the rights over the reward had been transferred.", "She looked around stealthily. Although Eun Yuri was the one who had the highest amount of Survival Points in the Neutral Zone, the other five members of her team weren\u2019t doing so badly either.", "If they truly wanted, they would have no trouble buying an item from the VIP store. Money aside, the VIP store\u2019s items belonged to whoever bought them first.", "Once Eun Yuri reminded herself of this, she shot up and ran. The other five tilted their heads as they watched her rush up the stairs.", "Maria, who was dozing off at the counter, woke up in a startle at the sound of the door bursting open. Seeing the customer who revisited after three months, or 89 days to be exact, she smiled brightly.", "Managing the VIP store wasn\u2019t a popular role. The reason was obvious just by looking at the available items.", "[VIP Store Inventory]1. Pneuma\u2019s Sky Boots: 50,000 SP (1EA)2. Moirai\u2019s Souvenir: 600,000 SP (1EA)3.

Aphriso\u2019s Sedge: 150,000 SP (5EA)[2]", "The cheapest item cost 50,000 Survival Points, an amount most survivors could not even dream of having.", "Although any item sold by the VIP store would net its manager a hefty chunk of Survival Points, there weren\u2019t many people who could buy its items.", "This was why Maria was so ecstatic to see Eun Yuri, who had bought all of the Special Competences on the first day of the Neutral Zone.", "\u201cW-What would you like?\u201d", "Maria cupped her hands together and asked half-nervously and half-excitedly.", "Eun Yuri checked her Survival Points. She had earned 120,000 points in the Tutorial and another 430,000 in the Neutral Zone. Because she was the top ranker, she rarely had to use her points, making her have more than 500,000 points.", "On top of this, she had six one-time use VIP store coupons.", "Eun Yuri yelled without hesitation.", "\u201cI\u2019ll take Moirai's Souvenir first!\u201d", "\u201cHuk\u2014\u201d", "Maria\u2019s eyes split open.

She twisted her body and moaned like she was about to die of happiness.", "\u201cSt\u2014 stop! Stop it! Are you trying to kill me? Stop it, I tell you!\u201d", "Maria shouted hysterically and begged for mercy, but Eun Yuri did not let her off.", "\u201cI want Aphriso\u2019s Sedge! I\u2019ll take four of them!\u201d", "\u201cHUAAAAAAAANG!\u201d", "In the end, Maria could not bear the consecutive bombshells and collapsed on the floor.

That was\u2014 until she heard what she said next.", "\u201cI\u2019ll buy these six with the VIP store coupons. I have six coupons so it works out perfectly.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d", "Maria\u2019s face stiffened. It went without saying that instructors could only earn Survival Points spent by survivors. Since these items were purchased for free, she would naturally end up with \u2018zero\u2019 points.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Maria madly blinked her eyes while doubting her ears. Soon, she checked Eun Yuri\u2019s Survival Points and rewards.", "\u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201d", "Maria\u2019s face distorted.", "How can it be? How can it be!!!? The ray of hope she tasted after three months of despair had vanished into thin air.", "\u201cFUCK!\u201d", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "Eun Yuri was taken aback.

FUUUUUUUUCK!\u201d", "\u201cWhy are you swearing all of a sudden\u2026 Anyway, hurry up, please.\u201d", "\u201cShut it! You treacherous bitch! You dare make a fool out of me!?\u201d", "\u201cWhat?

We met in the Neutral Zone! We went to Ramman Village together! We went to the Banquet together! We went to war! We went on expeditions!

Eh!?\u201d", "Maria had completely gone nuts.", "She was already spending her days depressed after a poor attempt at imitating a large-scale force and losing all the money she made by investing in stocks.", "In other words, she was lashing out at Eun Yuri to vent her pent-up frustration.

Thank you!\u201d", "Eun Yuri looked completely dumbstruck.", "\u2018Just who is this?\u2019", "Because Eun Yuri was staring at her so intensely, Maria let out a dry cough and raised her eyebrows.", "\u201cI\u2019m so grateful, what should I do?

He originally planned to obtain Moirai\u2019s Souvenir only, so how could he not be happy when he received so many items on top of the regular Competences to be used for training?", "\u2018She\u2019s something, alright.\u2019", "Seol Jihu had kept his promise, and Eun Yuri had kept hers. More than what she promised, in fact. Since she was so generous, it was only right that Seol Jihu returned the favor.", "\u2018Come to think of it, she looked a little depressed.\u2019", "It made sense for her to feel bitter given that she had to hand over the items she worked so hard to obtain.", "\u2018Today\u2019s the last day. Should I go talk to her?\u2019", "Deciding as he pleased, Seol Jihu put an item in his back pocket before leaving his room. He stopped by the cafeteria on his way to grab a couple of beer cans, then walked up the stairs.", "\u201cMiss Eun Yuri?\u201d", "Tok, tok. Knocking lightly, the door shot open.", "Eun Yuri walked out in a tank top and a towel on her head. She must have taken a hot bath as her hair was wet. She gave off a sweet scent, possibly from the vitality-recovering herb put in the bath.", "\u201cCan we talk for a bit? Today\u2019s the last day.\u201d", "Seol Jihu winked as he held up a can of beer.", "Eun Yuri lowered her head slightly. The way she blankly stared at the ground, she seemed to be hesitating. On the other hand, she seemed to be on guard.", "\u201cOkay.\u201d", "However, her hesitation did not last long.", "\u201cPerfect timing. I wanted to ask you something.\u201d", "She must have a lot of frustration pent-up inside as she spoke in an argumentative tone. Seol Jihu tilted his head, but Eun Yuri had already turned away.", "The room had a couch and a table, but Eun Yuri sat down on the floor. Seol Jihu sat across from her. The man and the woman drank beer quietly as they munched on dried jerky.", "As an awkward silence continued, Eun Yuri suddenly let out a sigh. Perhaps because she just got out of the bath or because alcohol entered her system or because she was simply weak at alcohol, her neck was already red.", "She looked like she would drink herself to sleep, so Seol Jihu quickly initiated the conversation.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had something to talk to me about?\u201d", "\u201cYes, but\u2026 can\u2019t you go first, Oppa?\u201d", "She seemed to be extra careful.", "\u2018Right, I\u2019d be disappointed too if the fruits of my labor were taken away.\u2019", "Empathizing with Eun Yuri\u2019s predicament, Seol Jihu took out Miyal\u2019s Branding Iron from his pocket.", "\u201cHere\u2019s a present.\u201d", "Eun Yuri stared at the stamp. She seemed to be at a loss for what to do, just like someone who received a surprise gift.", "\u201cThis is Miyal\u2019s Branding Iron.

You\u2019re more than qualified to take it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his hand. He looked like he would force it on her even if she refused. Eun Yuri lowered her head and took the branding iron.", "\u201cThank you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu observed Eun Yuri intently as she studied Miyal\u2019s Branding Iron. She didn\u2019t look all that happy. No, she looked like she liked it, but her eyes were still without energy.", "\u2018Why\u2026?\u2019", "Looking at her with his Nine Eyes, he saw that her current emotion was \u2018complicated\u2019.", "\u201cUm, do you want anything else?\u201d", "\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine, so tell me.

I really had a lot of fun, so I was reluctant to leave on the last day.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not that attached to this place\u2026 We all have to leave anyways.\u201d", "Eun Yuri shook her head. A soft swirling was heard from the beer can.", "Did she think it was strange that Seol Jihu was asking this and that? She took a sip of beer and asked, \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d", "\u201cNo reason. You just looked a little down.\u201d", "Tak. The beer can slammed down a little harder. Eun Yuri puckered her lips and sucked in the liquid on her lips. After sucking a few times, she opened her mouth.", "\u201cUm, there\u2019s something I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d", "\u201cOppa, you have a girlfriend, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows.

The silver ring on her ring finger sparkled under the light.", "\u201cWhy did you give this ring to me?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Should I have not?\u201d", "\u201cYou can, but you put it on my ring finger and said it was a present just for me.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, that ring is the medium that\u2019s needed to enter the dream world. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a present just for Miss Eun Yuri.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d", "\u201cAnd when you\u2019re gifting a ring to a girl, aren\u2019t you supposed to put it on their left ring finger?\u201d", "\u201c!?\u201d", "Eun Yuri was surprised twice. But the second surprise was a magnitude bigger than the first. She stuttered.", "\u201cN-No, who told you that?\u201d", "\u201cMy ex-girlfriend. My mom also said the same thing.\u201d", "\u201cEx-girlfriend and Oppa\u2019s mother?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "Eun Yuri swept her forehead up and lifted her chin up.", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I must be stupid because I can\u2019t understand a thing. Can you explain again? In more detail.\u201d", "Seol Jihu scratched his head. He didn\u2019t know why he had to explain it to the last detail, but seeing Eun Yuri\u2019s confused face, he decided to tell her.", "\u201cWas it when I was in my first year of middle school\u2026? Making a ring out of coins was a popular fad at the time. I wasn\u2019t an exception.\u201d", "\u201cOkay, go on.\u201d", "\u201cBut after I made one, I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. The fad was pretty much over by then too. So I asked my ex-girlfriend, no, I guess we weren\u2019t dating back then. We were childhood friends. Anyway, I asked her if she wanted it, and she was really happy. That was when I first heard it.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2026. Wait, didn\u2019t Oppa\u2019s mother say the same thing?\u201d", "\u201cShe did. She was there actually when the exchange was happening, and she smiled and said Seonhwa was absolutely right.\u201d", "Eun Yuri was struck speechless. She wasn\u2019t sure what she just heard.", "\u201cSo you\u2019re saying this idea was embedded into your mind after hearing that?\u201d", "\u201cIf you put it like that, it\u2019s like I was brainwashed or something. It\u2019s not that bad. Just\u2026 Seonhwa is always right.\u201d", "\u201cNo, Oppa, what someone says can\u2019t always be right.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s true, but things Seonhwa says to me are. You know, it\u2019s like the saying, if you listen to your mom, you\u2019ll get a rice cake even while you\u2019re asleep. Seonhwa was like that for me. If only I listened to what she said\u2026 then things wouldn\u2019t have turned out like this.\u201d", "Seol Jihu said regrettably. But Eun Yuri, who didn\u2019t know his circumstances very well, still had question marks in her eyes. But as a fellow obsessive love disorder patient, she had an idea.", "\u201cDid that Unni say that often? That Oppa should just listen to her, that she\u2019s always right, and that this is all for Oppa\u2019s benefit.\u201d", "\u201cOh? How did you know? Seonhwa says that all the time.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You said you were childhood friends?\u201d", "\u201cYep, our parents were friends even before we were born. She was also my neighbor.\u201d", "\u201cSo you must have known her for a long time.\u201d", "\u201cSince the day we were born. We were always together since we were babies, but we didn\u2019t start dating until we got into college. Ah, I still remember. I mustered up the courage to ask her out, and she suddenly burst into tears, saying that she\u2019s been dying of frustration since elementary school and that she\u2019s finally gotten her wish\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled pleasantly as he reminisced about past memories.", "The clever Eun Yuri began to understand the details of Seol Jihu\u2019s background. To be more precise, exactly how Seol Jihu ended up this way.", "\u2018He\u2019s been\u2026 completely brainwashed\u2026\u2019", "Although Seol Jihu denied it, it wouldn\u2019t be brainwashing in the first place if he was aware. From the looks of it, this ex-girlfriend of his had carefully groomed him over a long period of time, and his family seemed to have helped secretly.", "Simply put, the ex-girlfriend had earmarked him at a young age and raised him to her taste. Just how much did she like him to go so far?", "Eun Yuri applauded the care and effort this Seonhwa put into grooming him while feeling a chill at the same time. This woman\u2019s tenacity was definitely not something Eun Yuri could match.", "\u2018Maybe she instilled this strange common sense into him to ward off other girls who would approach him\u2026\u2019", "It was a plausible theory given the underwear gift incident. Moreover, Eun Yuri also became awkward around Seol Jihu after he gifted her a ring.", "Eun Yuri quietly muttered in astonishment.", "\u201cBut\u2026 if you groomed him so much, why not hold onto him to the bitter end\u2026? Why set him free\u2026? Ah\u2026 he said he was a gambler\u2026.\u201d", "She tilted the beer can back as her body slowly leaned forward. She was speaking with her body language, Whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter what happens.", "\u201cAre you alright?\u201d", "\u201cYeees\u2014 I\u2019m fine\u2026.\u201d", "Unlike what she was saying, the way the end of her speech trailed off showed that she was drunk. Eun Yuri cooled herself off with the coldness of the floor and muttered weakly.", "\u201cI\u2019m still not sure I understand everything\u2026 but I think I may have been misunderstanding things\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu stared at her before going \u201cAh\u201d. He started to understand what misunderstandings Eun Yuri had.", "\u2018Was that why her current emotion was complicated?\u2019", "He grinned, thinking how absurd it was, before bursting into laughter. It would be a different story if it were Seo Yuhui, but to be completely honest, Eun Yuri was not his type.", "\u201cIt must have been a misunderstanding. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not an easy guy.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke rubbish while being blissfully ignorant. As he slowly turned his gaze, he saw Eun Yuri grumbling. For some reason, her expression was full of dissatisfaction.", "Because this side of her was rather refreshing, Seol Jihu ended up laughing once more. Looking back, Eun Yuri had rarely revealed her emotions during the Tutorial. He never knew what she was thinking about, and whenever she stared blankly into the air, he wondered if he invited a fool.", "But now, she was revealing a small part of her inner thoughts. Perhaps this was Eun Yuri\u2019s real self. In that case, he must have gotten closer to her compared to the Tutorial.", "Thinking so, Seol Jihu cheered up.", "*", "Same time.", "It was deep into the night, but the Eva Royal Palace was bustling.
