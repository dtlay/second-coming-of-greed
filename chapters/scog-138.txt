Like, they say he\u2019s already Level 3! Get it? Level 3!\"", "\"Huh? He\u2019s Level 3!

You don\u2019t know who Seol-nim is? Then I suppose there\u2019s no helping it but to tell you about him again. Listen carefully, now.

He\u2019s something else.\u201d", "The gaping mouth of the middle-aged man showed no signs of closing.", "There was a limit in trying to understand the unreasonable. Considering that an Earthling usually took 2 to 3 years at the fastest to reach Level 4, Seol Jihu\u2019s growth speed had long surpassed being just \u2018amazing\u2019 and was simply terrifying.", "Even throughout all of history, his monstrous speed would have easily placed him in the top three.", "On the flip side, this also meant that while his case was extremely rare, there were still cases like him. Only after realizing this did the middle-aged man barely close his mouth.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all good nevertheless.

On the other hand, he couldn\u2019t help but feel unsettled, thinking that things were complicated.", "He knew that Chohong didn\u2019t have any ambitions about being the leader. But not taking up the position because she didn\u2019t want to and fully supporting him as the team\u2019s leader after acknowledging him was a different matter altogether.", "So he had painstakingly prepared and carefully asked, only for her to throw out a \u2018Sure.

So what are you worried about?\u201d", "As Chohong remarked, it could be said that there really was nothing to worry about. He had already proven his uniqueness.", "He had appeased the spirit in an unconventional manner in the Forest of Denial, proven his bravery when he lured hundreds of Parasites in the Arden Valley, and pulled off the impossible when he solved the mystery behind the Ramman Village.", "Was that all? He had provided a plan for the rescue mission and had even displayed his ability to sway a crowd during the Banquet.", "And this was leaving out his Gold Stamp or his monstrous growth speed. The numerous accomplishments that he had unknowingly accumulated naturally provided him with the qualifications to be acknowledged as a leader.", "However, it would have been a different story if Chohong had also aimed for the role. But since she even went ahead saying that acting as the temporary leader had been much too exhausting, there was no reason for him to persuade her against it.", "\u201cDon\u2019t think about it too much. There wasn\u2019t anything big either when we made Dylan the leader.\u201d", "Though Chohong said not to worry, it wasn\u2019t reassuring at all. After all, the visions he and Dylan had were completely different.", "Was it really okay to just accept the role this easily?", "Seol Jihu turned his dazed eyes. Hugo was looking outside the window as if he hadn\u2019t heard anything.", "\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d", "He was blissfully gazing at the house across the street. More accurately, he was staring at Seo Yuhui who was standing outside her door.", "Hugo was unresponsive even when he carefully tried calling him.", "\"Hugo!\"", "\"\u2026Yea?\"", "Hugo finally responded when Seol Jihu shouted for his attention. But even then, he made shooing gestures with his hands without turning around, saying with his actions not to bother him.", "\u201cYea yea. Sure. Okay. From now on, Seol is our leader.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s tense face collapsed upon hearing Hugo\u2019s simple reply. He felt stupid for racking his mind until his head hurt all night long on how to convince the two of them.", "\u201cPhew.\u201d", "Chohong who jumped down from the pull-up bar, placed her hand on Seol Jihu\u2019s shoulders.", "\u201cHey. You must have felt it living with us for a while, but Hugo, that bastard, is a guy who\u2019ll outright express whatever he has on his mind.

Can we talk a bit?\u201d", "Seol Jihu wanted to have a serious conversation with Hugo.", "\u201cTalk? Sounds good.\u201d", "\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWow\u2026 Isn\u2019t she just so beautiful?\u201d", "\"\u2026.\"", "Seol Jihu decided to give up."]}
