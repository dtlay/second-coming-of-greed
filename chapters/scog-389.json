A ring?\u201d", "\u201cYes!\u201d", "Seo Yuhui spread her fingers out.", "\u201cJihu gave it to me~\u201d", "She seemed to be boasting.

That\u2019s not something they do so easily\u2026 Not Priests, at least.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "\u201cYep. Priests have the closest relationship to their gods among the four basic classes, so a vow made on their god\u2019s name places a heavy restriction on them that rivals an oath. That\u2019s why Priests with even a little thought would never make vows on their god\u2019s name.\u201d", "Meaning, Chohong was completely thoughtless.", "Seol Jihu grinned.", "\u201cWhat if they signed a contract?

They were heading toward the direction of the former Delphinion Duchy.", "The march went without a hitch as Hoshino Urara was a Unique Ranker Archer and Chohong had taken this route before when she went to rescue Seol Jihu, who was trapped in the laboratory.", "Perhaps because they were in a mountain, night came rather quickly.", "Valhalla\u2019s main team marched for almost an entire day before arriving at their destination.", "Because the bishop gave them a detailed roadmap, it wasn\u2019t hard to find the place.", "There was just one problem.", "\u201cHuh? This is that Gorad Boga place?\u201d", "Chohong frowned as she looked around her surroundings.", "All she could see was a dense forest filled with trees and overgrown bushes.", "She couldn\u2019t see anything like a trace of a city that was once ruled by a god after his birth.", "If anything, the darkness of the forest gave off a bleak, creepy feeling.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s up with this place? For Huge Stone Rocky Mountain and Mount Pel\u00e9eom, it was easy to see vital energy in the atmosphere.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a myth from thousands of years ago.

What do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cPriests convert vital energy into holy power by praying in areas of high vital energy concentration. But this is refined holy power.

Then remember the spots where I\u2019m stopping.\u201d", "With that, Seol Jihu started walking again.", "Eun Yuri stared fixedly at the spot Seol Jihu had been standing in before chasing after him with light steps.", "Kneeling down, rummaging through his pocket, and then placing his hand on the ground. Seol Jihu repeated the same set of actions dozens of times while circling around the campsite.", "\u201cThere\u2019s more than I thought. Can you remember them all?\u201d", "\u201cY-Yes, I can, but\u2026\u201d", "Eun Yuri stared at Seol Jihu curiously.", "She had kept quiet so that she wouldn\u2019t unintentionally bother Seol Jihu, but she couldn\u2019t figure out why he was stopping at these places.", "\u201cAlright, here\u2019s the thing\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu lowered his voice and spoke.", "After listening to his explanation, Eun Yuri became even more puzzled.", "\u201cSo\u2026 that\u2019s the signal?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Me raising this spear.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled and tapped the Spear of Purity.", "\u201cThink of it as a cue.
