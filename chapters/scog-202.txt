Body on the slimmer side, and what else\u2026 Oh yeah! This person is a woman, judging by the length of her hair and her curves.\u201d", "Seol Jihu put what he saw in the vision into words, but made it sound like it was something he heard from Miss Foxy.", "\u201cAnd also\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t miss a glint of surprise flashing across Pavlovici\u2019s face.", "\u201cA palm-sized purple snake tattoo on her neck.\u201d", "Pavlovici\u2019s eyes widened slightly. Seol Jihu rested his chin on the back of his palm and asked.", "\u201cYou know her, right?\u201d", "He couldn\u2019t jump to any conclusion yet\u2026", "\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019", "But he could always just make up a good excuse. Basically, all he was trying to do right now was probe the man.", "The vision Seol Jihu saw was this\u2014 the four people in front of him were lying dead in an alleyway, and not a single one of them had shown him a different vision. Meaning, these four would meet the same fate.", "Another thing to note was that all four would be killed by the mysterious female Earthling he just described. She was so scrupulous that she even had her face covered in his vision, but the scene of Pavlovici with a hole in his chest glaring at her until he died was still vivid in Seol Jihu\u2019s mind.", "Pavlovici seemed to be shaking in resentment and injustice as well.", "\u201cHo\u2026 how\u2026.\u201d", "Perhaps because of how shocked he was, he acknowledged that he knew her.", "Seol Jihu considered selling Kim Hannah again, then grinned. Sometimes, silence was more effective than words.", "A short silence flowed before Seol Jihu finally spoke.", "\u201cYou said you told us everything. Were you lying?\u201d", "\u201cWe told you everything!\u201d", "The man kneeling furthest back shouted. Judging by his face, he seemed to be the youngest sibling of the Alexei brothers. He was only 20 according to his Status Window.", "Pavlovici darted a quick glance at him, but he seemed to have already made up his mind.", "\u201cThe reason we didn\u2019t mention that woman was because we weren\u2019t sure she was related to the work we received.\u201d", "\u201cThat woman?\u201d", "\u201cYes. We met her when we got our first mission, but it was just once. Her face was veiled, so we didn\u2019t see it. But we definitely remember seeing a purple snake tattoo on the left side of her neck.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head, gesturing at him to go on.", "\u201cAfter that, she notified us of work to do by sending her underlings.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what about this one?\u201d", "\u201cYou see\u2026 we\u2019re not really sure.\u201d", "The man became more careful.", "\u201cIn the past, we could tell their relationship with that woman by their clothing or a mark on their necks. But the client this time was different. This person was hiding his or her identity with a turban and a gown, but that\u2019s nothing uncommon.\u201d", "Seol Jihu looked up before nodding a couple of times.", "\u201cThat person must be related to the snake tattooed woman. Probably.\u201d", "Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have appeared in his vision.", "\u201cJudging by how meticulous they were, looks like they did their homework in researching my background. They were probably thinking, \u2018If it works, it works. If it doesn\u2019t work, that\u2019s fine too\u2019\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu blurred the end of his speech before glancing at the four men.", "\u201cI can\u2019t be sure, but it\u2019s very likely. And well\u2026 They will probably kill you soon. Like killing a dog after the hunt is over.\u201d", "Soon? The four men sent a dazed glance hearing the certainty in Seol Jihu\u2019s tone.", "\u201cWhat a pain in the ass. Even if you die here, those dirty bastards will package it to their advantage and publish it as a newspaper\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu cracked his head left and right while muttering as though the whole thing annoyed him.", "Pavlovici instantly realized that Seol Jihu was talking about them, but couldn\u2019t tell whether he was telling the truth or not.", "But one thing that was certain was that Seol Jihu knew far more about this matter than they did, and that most of the things he said so far were true.", "Not only had he found out that they were brothers, but he had also described that woman accurately.", "That\u2019s why Pavlovici couldn\u2019t help, but be bothered.", "That they would soon die.", "\u201cRight, there\u2019s no reason to give them a news story. Fine, you can leave.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shooed them away as if he was being generous.", "\u201cThe Priest should be coming soon. Why don\u2019t you stay and get healed first?\u201d", "He is letting us live? And healing us too?", "The four men\u2019s eyes widened. It wasn\u2019t because they were happy. Setting aside the fact that he was letting them live, it was more like he was trying to avoid a dirty pile of dog turd on the ground.", "\u201cAh, let\u2019s get this straight, just so we\u2019re clear. The four of you were alive when you left Carpe Diem. This is it for our relationship. Even if you get lucky and survive, don\u2019t go around spreading false rumors about us, alright? If you do\u2026\u201d", "A sharp glint flickered in Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes as he muttered grimly.", "At the same time, the suspicion in the men\u2019s hearts solidified into assurance. Each and every word that was coming out of Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth was foretelling their deaths.", "Seol Jihu waved his hand to quickly shoo them away, but the four men didn\u2019t budge an inch.", "They found themselves in a rather ironic situation. Because they were now looking for a way to live in a place they thought would be their grave\u2026.", "\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d", "One of the men mustered up his courage and carefully began to talk. He was the youngest of the four brothers.", "\u201cYou said we will die soon\u2026 What do you mean by that\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu, who was putting a cigarette in his mouth, blinked.", "\u201cOh, just think about it.\u201d", "With a snort, he spoke as if he was too lazy to explain but had no other choice.", "\u201cYou lost your value the moment we published a rebuttal article explaining how papers denouncing me were written before you even provoked us at the pub. Publishing an interview article now would only exacerbate the public opinion against them.\u201d", "Seol Jihu prompted, \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d And the four men nodded their heads.", "\u201cAnyways, everyone knows that you four were only tails to be cut off. Now, Carpe Diem will obviously do its best to find out who they are, and those guys will probably do their best to avoid being caught.\u201d", "After a lengthy explanation, Seol Jihu fiddled with the end of his cigarette.", "\u201cConsidering how meticulous they are, I doubt they would let you walk around alive even if we let you live. At least\u2026 That\u2019s what I would bet on.\u201d", "The man\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u201cW-We only did what we were told!\u201d", "And he shouted defyingly.", "\u201cNever mind their organization, we don\u2019t even know a single face of their members! We, we just\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI know.\u201d", "Seol Jihu affirmed calmly.", "\u201cThen just continue to think like that\u2014 \u2018Ah, we don\u2019t know their faces or even their organization. We just did what we were told. They won\u2019t kill us since we don\u2019t know anything, right?\u2019\u201d", "Pavlovici\u2019s pupils shook.", "\u201cBut consider this. They can kill you and mutilate your body, then throw out a story with a headline that reads, \u2018Did Carpe Diem have to go this far?\u2019\u201d", "The more Seol Jihu talked, the more their faces contorted.", "\u201cYou\u2019re free to imagine, but let me give you a word of advice. From now on, don\u2019t stay together with just the four of you and join an organization to rely on. Though\u2026 I don\u2019t know if the Haramark Royal Family, Sicilia, the Triads, the Assassination Union, or the other large-scale organizations would be willing to accept you.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took his eyes off them and lit his cigarette as if he really was done with them. However, the four men still refused to move an inch.", "\u201c\u2026What?\u201d", "Seol Jihu smirked.", "\u201cYou want to live?\u201d", "The brothers, who were staring at each other worriedly, turned their gazes to Seol Jihu.", "\u201cUnfortunately, my answer won\u2019t change. There are two ways for you to survive, but neither of them is of any interest to me.\u201d", "At that moment, Pavlovici, who was laying sprawled on the floor, groaned loudly. Furrowing his brows and sweating profusely, he brought himself onto his knees with great difficulty. His broken arms still hanging limp, he pleaded.", "\u201cPwease\u2026 hwep us\u2026.\u201d", "His words were more intelligible than before.", "\u201cHelp you? Why not just run to Earth?\u201d", "\u201cEwarth ishn\u2019t swafe eisher.\u201d", "Pavlovici shook his head with much trouble.", "\u201cWe arr sowwy. We\u2019ll do ash you shay.

We\u2019ll pway back thish debt bwig!\u201d", "Please, we\u2019ll pay back this debt big.", "Seol Jihu liked the sound of that. They weren\u2019t saying they would pledge their loyalty, but that they would pay it back in equivalent value if he let them live.", "This was something that aligned with Seol Jihu\u2019s principle. And in truth, it was what he was waiting for as well.", "\u201cHm, I don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d", "But Seol Jihu didn\u2019t take the chance immediately. Not only were words easy to say and hard to carry out, but the brothers shouldn\u2019t have erased the doubt inside them completely.", "People like them, they wouldn\u2019t truly understand something until they experienced it themselves.", "\u201cI say all this, but it probably doesn\u2019t feel real to you yet.\u201d", "Pavlovici flinched. He raised his upper body once again.", "\u201cSo let\u2019s do this.\u201d", "With a grin, Seol Jihu called Marcel Ghionea. After the Archer of Steel walked in, Seol Jihu whispered something into his ear.", "\u201cYes, okay, got it.\u201d", "Nodding his head in understanding, Marcel Ghionea glanced at the four men. He muttered as soon as the explanation was over.", "\u201cIt might be a bit difficult on my own.\u201d", "\u201cWill it?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s highly probable that the enemy will move in a group, and people like them generally use different people to act as scout and attacker.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea thought about the matter for a while before saying.", "\u201cI\u2019m confident I can do it if I have a helper.\u201d", "\u201cWho?\u201d", "\u201cSomeone like Miss Phi Sora\u2026 there aren\u2019t many who are stronger than her in Haramark.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t mind, but do you think you can convince her?\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea hesitated a little.", "\u201cUh\u2026 didn\u2019t she borrow equipment from you, leader? If you tell her you\u2019ll extend the lending period a bit, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll agree even if she grumbles.\u201d", "Seeing the ash-grey haired Archer tighten his grip on his own white bow, Seol Jihu gave an insipid smile.", "\u201cAlright, if you can succeed, I\u2019ll let you hold onto that bow for a long time.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea\u2019s eyes sparkled instantly.", "\u201cI\u2019ll see to it that it is a success!

We\u2019ll continue next time we meet.\u201d", "He was clearly chasing them out. He didn\u2019t even look at them, as if it didn\u2019t matter whether the brothers took the communication crystal or not.", "Pavlovici\u2019s gaze slowly fell on the orb in front of him.", "Soon\u2026", "Bow. Pavlovici lowered his head before tightly holding onto the blood-stained crystal.", "Almost as if it was a new life.", "*", "Under Seol Jihu\u2019s permission, the four of them left Carpe Diem\u2019s office after being treated by a Priest.", "\u201cAh\u2014 I really don\u2019t get it!\u201d", "And unsurprisingly, Chohong, who wasn\u2019t aware of the details, exploded in anger.", "\u201cFuck, it\u2019s already a miracle that they made it out of here alive, but what? You even healed them? Lookie here, we\u2019ve got a saint!\u201d", "\u201cSeol, I don\u2019t mean to intrude on your authority as the leader, but I just can\u2019t agree with this. This isn\u2019t it. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d", "Hugo became uncharacteristically serious and supported Chohong. Even Phi Sora snorted as if Seol Jihu was a kill-joy.", "\u201cQuiet, all of you!\u201d", "Jang Maldong roared, unable to bear the sight of their bickering, but Chohong yelled back instead.", "\u201cQuiet? Why should we? You saw it too, old man!

You saw what he did! How does this make any sense!?\u201d", "Chohong smacked her chest as if the entire situation was frustrating her to death. But not caring about her outburst, Seol Jihu simply giggled and happily smoked his cigarette.", "Chohong grit her teeth ferociously and plopped down next to him as if to devour him alive.", "\u201cHey, just what were you thinking letting them go like that?\u201d", "\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just that I felt bad killing them when they were apologizing so sincerely. You know, it made me all uncomfortable.\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s face turned red with anger at Seol Jihu\u2019s carefree explanation.", "\u201cJesus, I\u2019m gonna go crazy. We\u2019re perfectly justified, no one is going to bat an eye even if we kill them. You think people will think you\u2019re kind because you let them live? Did you get infected by a goody-two-shoes virus? Hey, Ghio! Say something too! Wait, where did that son of a bitch go?\u201d", "Turning her head left and right, Chohong growled once again.", "\u201cListen, man. This is going to make people think you\u2019re a pushover, a gutless idiot. You think that\u2019s it? Even the enemy will see this and mock you as a retard!\u201d", "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound that bad.\u201d", "Seol Jihu spoke calmly.

Why?\u201d", "When Seol Jihu made a confused expression, Chohong slowly closed her eyes and then opened them back up.", "\u201cHey, did you just\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d", "At that moment, Agnes got up from the couch.", "\u201cI\u2019ll see you off.\u201d", "Normally, she would have said it was fine or that he didn\u2019t need to.

Was she mad because he released the Alexei brothers she worked so hard to capture?", "Naturally, that was the first thing he thought of. But Agnes was only now starting.", "\u201cDrop your head a little and loosen your pupils too. Try to remain as expressionless as possible.\u201d", "The odd pressure behind her words forced Seol Jihu to follow her demand.

A person\u2019s face, expression, glance, gesture, appearance, and even the sound of their breathing\u2026 some can synthesize even the tiniest information to guess someone\u2019s intention. This is an ability recognized by the Seven Gods, and some have even been promoted to a High Ranker because of it. Miss Foxy is one such example.\u201d", "With that, Agnes clasped her hands in front of her skirt like she always did.", "\u201cIf you have time, try taking acting lessons.
