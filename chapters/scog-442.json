{"cid": "442", "title": "Chapter 442. The Star Sets in the Valley (1)", "content": ["A bird with colorful feathers was cutting through the grey sky. The phoenix craning its neck left and right in search of something was none other than Little Chick.", "Little Chick and Flone kept their promise to Seol Jihu. Even when they saw the withdrawing Parasite troops, they avoided making contact with them as promised and did not go back.", "It wasn\u2019t as if they didn\u2019t run into them. But Little Chick led the way, risking its life to scout for danger, and Flone flew safely while carrying the unconscious Seo Yuhui.", "Other than at times Seo Yuhui woke up and had to be forced down, they flew day and night without stopping to rest. Perhaps because they could both fly, they were able to return to Haramark faster than anyone else.", "They threw Seo Yuhui in the royal palace as soon as they arrived. Once they heard from Prihi that the Federation and humanity\u2019s combined forces should have crossed the border already, they immediately set off to rescue Seol Jihu, who should be fighting against the entirety of the Parasite army alone.", "They couldn\u2019t help but think that it was already too late\u2026 but they had no choice but to go back.", "After all, they believed in him.", "Seol Jihu wouldn\u2019t die. He had weathered numerous life-threatening storms before.", "He was a man who, when on the verge of collapsing, stood up each time.", "So, they believed he would do the same this time as well.", "Even if he fell for a moment, he would undoubtedly stand back up and come back alive for everyone to see.", "Just like always.", "\u2018Please\u2026. Please\u2026.!\u2019", "The phoenix could not hide its anxiousness even as it flew at a terrifying speed. It had separated from Flone long ago.", "There just wasn\u2019t enough information. Finding Seol Jihu in this vast territory was like finding a needle in a haystack.", "There was no way to tell if he had escaped, or was still surrounded, or if he was being pursued.", "Not only that, Little Chick couldn\u2019t maintain its phoenix form permanently, which also slowed down the search. And so, Little Chick sent Flone ahead to the predicted location of the battle and was scouring a different area based on his prediction of Seol Jihu\u2019s path of escape.", "\u2018I came this far, and he\u2019s not here\u2026. Does that mean he escaped toward the Federation\u2026?\u2019", "Little Chick shook off his anxious thoughts and continued to fly. Then suddenly, his wide-range sensing ability detected a source of evil energy.", "It did not feel like a demonic being, but Little Chick changed its course just to be safe. The closer it got to the source, the more it felt sure of the evil energy\u2019s identity.", "The faint fragrance changed into a demonic being\u2019s strong stench of blood.", "\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d", "At that moment, Little Chick screamed. Just when it thought things couldn\u2019t possibly get any worse, it had run out of energy.", "\u201cDamn it!\u201d", "It tried its best to maintain its phoenix form, but it was falling from the sky rapidly.", "In the end, a light flashed from the sky. The phoenix disappeared and a small, bright-yellow bird fell to the ground.", "Crash. Only after hitting the ground and rolling on the dirt several times did Little Chick barely grab hold of its body.", "\u201cKaahaak!\u201d", "Limping up, Little Chick spat out a mouthful of blood. A crimson stain was smeared around its beak. Because Little Chick repeatedly transformed into its phoenix form during its flight back, too much burden had been placed on its body.", "Despite this, Little Chick did not stop. After spitting out blood, it quickly moved to the evil energy\u2019s location and saw the blood-stained ground.", "\u2018This is\u2026!\u2019", "Blood that was not dry yet was forming a long trail on the dirt. The path extended for a long distance, seemingly endless in the way it disappeared into the horizon.", "Little Chick looked around the area before abruptly running in one direction. Its tiny legs moved urgently.", "Little Chick was half in doubt, but he hastened his steps, feeling his insides burning the more he followed the trail of blood.", "Then, at last, Little Chick stopped running at the end of the trail.", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "Inside the barren valley, Little Chick saw a man advancing forward while continually creating a bloody trail with each step.", "It really was Seol Jihu.", "A look of delight flashed across Little Chick\u2019s face when it saw Seol Jihu\u2019s white spear.", "\u201cHey!\u201d", "Little Chick skipped forward.", "\u201cHeeeey!\u201d", "Running in short and quick steps, it closed the distance in an instant.", "\u201cPart\u2026!\u201d", "But just as it was about to shout, \u2018Partner!\u2019, its beak dropped open. It became lost for words, its face dazed.", "The man lacked a right arm and was taking laborious steps using the spear in his left hand like a cane. The way he leaned on his spear, he looked feeble and out of strength.", "It was impressive enough that he was standing, much less walking. The state of his body\u2026 could hardly be called a human being\u2019s. The word \u2018terrible\u2019 did not begin to describe it.", "From the dried up blood around his eyes to the blood dripping down from the end of his nose, from the blood plastered across his face to the foul stench of blood mixed with sweat and pus\u2026 blood, blood, blood, blood\u2026 there was so much blood that his severed arm looked like the least serious injury.", "It was only now that Little Chick understood how the trail of blood was formed. If not for the Spear of Purity, it would not have even recognized Seol Jihu.", "Little Chick\u2019s eyes trembled. It could guess the scene of madness Seol Jihu must have paved through to get here.", "Tak!", "Seol Jihu dragged his feet on the ground, using his spear as a crutch, and slowly walked past Little Chick. His face, which could be seen from his drooping head, was completely dazed.", "\u201cPartner\u2026.\u201d", "It was only then that Little Chick muttered a word. It was also at this time that Seol Jihu regained his senses.", "\u2018\u2026Huh?\u2019", "Loosely opening his eyes, Seol Jihu saw the ground. He blinked, wondering just what happened.", "He remembered up until the point he got surrounded by the Army Commanders while trying to kill Sung Shihyun\u2026.", "At that moment, as Seol Jihu was staring blankly at the ground, his eyebrows twitched. He saw a familiar figure in his blurred vision. A small, bright-yellow thing was flapping its wings and looking up at him.", "\u201c\u2026!\u201d", "Now that he took a closer look, it seemed to be chirping something as well.", "\u201cSnap out of it\u2026! Hey\u2026!\u201d", "When he concentrated his nerves on listening, a frantic voice faintly rang out in his ears.", "Seol Jihu stared at Little Chick for a long time before his eyes widened slightly.", "\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d", "When he opened his eyes, Little Chick\u2019s eyes grew larger.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t I\u2026 tell you\u2026 not to\u2026 come back\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s submerged voice came out intermittently.", "\u201cI kept my promise, you bastard!\u201d", "Little Chick yelled.", "\u201cI brought that woman to Haramark safe and sound! I kept my promise, so what I do afterward is my choice!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026You did?\u201d", "I see. So Yuhui\u2019s safe. That\u2019s fine then. Seol Jihu internally breathed a sigh of relief.", "\u201cThanks\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cSave it! Anyway, what happened to you? Did you really break through that death trap?\u201d", "\u201cMe\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked slowly.", "It wasn\u2019t that he lost his memories. If anything, he remembered too much, too vividly. Just as his consciousness was about to flicker off, a message popped up that said Future Vision activated, and\u2026", "\u201cCough, cough\u2026!\u201d", "Seol Jihu coughed while he was trying to recall what happened. Even though it was only a light cough, a cold mixture of blood spurted out of his mouth.", "\u201cUkk\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tried to force himself to swallow it, but the blood still dripped down his mouth.", "\u201cNo, nevermind!\u201d", "Little Chick shook his head in fright.", "\u201cYou can just tell me about it later! Let\u2019s hurry back for now!\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled.", "\u201c\u2026Damn it! Can you even walk? Or wait! Let me regain some energy, and then we can\u2026\u201d", "Little Chick muttered, perhaps feeling sorry after seeing Seol Jihu\u2019s smile.", "\u201cAh, you have a communication crystal! Make a call now\u2026!\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head. He indeed had a communication crystal. Unfortunately, he did not have even an inkling of mana left with which he could activate it.", "For some reason, he couldn\u2019t gather the mana inside his body.", "\u2026No, in truth, he had an idea why.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, Seol Jihu continued walking. Using the Spear of Purity as a crutch, he placed his weight against it and dragged his feet.", "Now that he came to his senses, he realized just how tough and arduous this process was. It wasn\u2019t that the pain was excruciating, but his entire body stung as if it was scraped.", "And this was even after Black Seol Jihu cut off his sense of pain.", "\u2018Ah\u2026 come to think of it\u2026.\u2019", "A question rose in Seol Jihu\u2019s mind as he organized his thoughts. Up until now, he was not able to remember what happened when Future Vision was active.", "But it was different this time. He could faintly recall what happened after his Innate Ability activated and Black Seol Jihu took over his body.", "Black Seol Jihu battled the Army Commanders in his place and almost killed Sung Shihyun; he was thrown into the pit by the Parasite Queen\u2019s intervention, then coaxed the enemy and escaped, and\u2026", "[Good job\u2026.]", "[You did well\u2026. Really\u2026.]", "He said those words to him.", "\u2018What happened\u2026?\u2019", "While thinking, Seol Jihu suddenly felt his consciousness sink. His eyes slowly closed as well.", "\u201cAh! Hey, hey!\u201d", "A high-pitched scream struck his ears. His narrowed eyes widened slightly.", "Little Chick was screaming with a pressing look on its face. If not for his loud screaming, Seol Jihu most certainly would have lost his consciousness then.", "\u201cAre you okay?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, sorry\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu dropped his head. Leaning his forehead against the spear shaft, he panted slowly. At this point, he wasn\u2019t even sure he was breathing properly.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2026 suddenly blanked out\u2026\u201d", "\u201cSnap out of it! We\u2019re almost home\u2026!\u201d", "\u201cWe are\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cY\u2026 Yeah! We just have to cross this valley! Let\u2019s get going!\u201d", "Again, he started walking. Seol Jihu stopped thinking about the details and focused on moving his feet.", "Right, who cared? He had achieved what he desired. He protected the stele, his comrades were safe, and Seo Yuhui returned alive as well.", "Although, he fought and fought until his body was a frightening wreck to achieve this\u2026", "\u2018It\u2019s not bad\u2026.\u2019", "He was more than satisfied with the outcome.", "But if there was one thing he wanted, one thing he could wish for\u2026", "\u2018I want to\u2026 see everyone\u2026.\u2019", "It was to see his comrades.", "He wanted to reunite with everyone, embrace them, and share the joy of returning alive.", "And to do that, he had to get out of this valley.", "He did. But\u2026.", "Seol Jihu stared blankly at Little Chick, who was leading the way and constantly encouraging him. After a brief second, his gaze dropped to the ground.", "He tried to raise his head, but it kept falling down. Along with it, his bangs rolled down and blocked his vision.", "\u2018I want to rest\u2026.\u2019", "It wasn\u2019t like a feeling of exhaustion or wanting to lie down. He wanted to walk, but his body had escaped his control and was stopping on its own. He felt like he would fall into an eternal sleep if he closed his eyes.", "Soon, the light in his eyes dimmed. Little Chick\u2019s figure blurred like he went underwater.", "Suddenly, he felt something hard on his foot. At the same time, Seol Jihu\u2019s swaying steps stopped.", "\u2018Shoot!\u2019", "Little Chick gritted its teeth.", "There was a hill.", "The slope wasn\u2019t steep, but the way up was too long. It would have scoffed it off at any other time, but the current Seol Jihu was having trouble even taking a single step.", "It couldn\u2019t blame him. It was already a miracle that he was alive and moving. He must be steering his body with only his will to return, not even knowing where they were going\u2026.", "A cold wind blew.", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shuddered, the cold air seemingly penetrating his organs. Eventually, he could no longer bear it and fell on his knees.", "His body had been scorching hot during the battle, but now it was too cold. He could feel it losing temperature by the second.", "\u201cLittle Chick\u2026.\u201d", "A groaning voice flowed out.", "\u201cAre you\u2026 there\u2026?\u201d", "What do I do? Little Chick looked around their surroundings before gasping in shock. Seol Jihu\u2019s body was on the verge of collapse.", "\u201cW-What\u2019s wrong!?\u201d", "Little Chick ran up to him in a hurry and shouted.", "\u201cTo be\u2026 honest\u2026 I haven\u2019t\u2026 been able to\u2026 see\u2026 for a while\u2026.\u201d", "Cough, cough. Seol Jihu coughed again and panted with difficulty.", "\u201cLittle Chick\u2026.\u201d", "After a short silence, Seol Jihu finally spat out the thing that he kept gulping back into his throat. His face relaxed slightly.", "\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d", "After collecting his breath for a while, he asked out of the blue.", "\u201cWhat will happen to me\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cW-What?\u201d", "\u201cWill I\u2026 really forget\u2026?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cEverything that happened in Paradise\u2026 everything related to it\u2026 everything\u2026?\u201d", "His voice trembled out. As he continued his sentence one phrase at a time, a look of pain distorted Little Chick\u2019s face.", "\u201cI can\u2019t forget\u2026.\u201d", "A lamentation mixed with a sigh escaped his mouth.", "\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 go back\u2026 to how I was\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d", "Little Chick raised its voice, unable to bear listening any longer.", "\u201cGet back up if you have the energy to keep yapping!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cCome on, get up! Are you going to quit after you came this far? This is it! You just have to cross this hill! You\u2019re almost there!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cHey! Hey! Snap out of it! Didn\u2019t you say you didn\u2019t want to forget!? You said you can\u2019t forget! Then you can\u2019t die! You need to return alive!\u201d", "Little Chick shouted at the top of its lungs.", "It twisted its body in the middle of urging him. A faint light shone from its body, but the light scattered in the next instant as it coughed out of a mouthful of blood.", "It had suffered an injury while trying to transform forcefully.", "\u201cArgh, this damned body! This damned, damned body! You should have helped me evolve to adulthood earlier!\u201d", "Being a phoenix didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t feel pain. Immediately after Little Chick frowned and raised its voice in anger, it abruptly widened its eyes and raised its head.", "Seol Jihu, who had fallen to his knees, slowly got up.", "\u201cOkay\u2026.\u201d", "After picking himself back up, he smiled bitterly.", "\u201cI\u2019m going\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Ya bastard!\u201d", "Little Chick was on the verge of bursting into tears.", "\u201cI knew you could stand! Making me worry for nothing! Do you really want to pull a prank at a time like this?\u201d", "\u201cDoes it look like a prank\u2026\u201d", "\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s go! I\u2019m not kidding! You just have to climb this hill! The reinforcements are coming, so we should be able to meet up with them!\u201d", "Little Chick pulled on Seol Jihu\u2019s pants with its beak before deciding it wasn\u2019t working and climbed the hill first. It jumped up and down in the middle and desperately shouted at him to hurry up.", "Seol Jihu squeezed out every ounce of energy in his body and looked up. He put strength in his eyes. His vision came into focus, and he finally saw the hill for himself.", "For some reason, the hill in front of him overlapped with the image of the mountain he climbed in the Path of the Soul. The thought to climb it enveloped his head naturally.", "\u201cHurry up!\u201d", "Little Chick shouted.", "\u201cOkay, okay\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded.", "\u201cI have to live\u2026. Since I can\u2019t forget\u2026.\u201d", "He saw the ground again.", "Right.", "\u2018Let\u2019s go\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu slowly lifted his foot. Although he couldn\u2019t raise his head, he suddenly felt a lot lighter.", "Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.", "Even if I die here\u2026.", "Just a step more\u2026.", "Even if I can\u2019t\u2026 open my eyes again\u2026", "Let\u2019s take just one more\u2026 step\u2026", "And go\u2026.", "\u201cJust a little more! I think I can see them!\u201d", "Little Chick climbed the hill.", "\u201cI can hear something too! I think they\u2019re almost here! Come listen!\u201d", "It hopped up\u2026", "\u201cAren\u2019t you coming? Want me to go ahead? Hmm?\u201d", "\u2026and shouted nonstop.", "\u201cChet! Fine! I\u2019ll make a special exception just for you! If you can climb this hill, I\u2019ll liberate the Spear of Purity\u2019s sixth and seventh stage!\u201d", "Little Chick shouted whatever came to his mind.", "\u201cOf course, you\u2019ll have to help me evolve to adulthood before that!\u201d", "It felt like it had to.", "\u201cTo do that, you have to go back alive\u2026!\u201d", "It was then.", "Tang!", "A metallic clang suddenly rang out.", "\u201c!\u201d", "Little Chick did a double-take and looked back in a hurry. It immediately became stunned.", "The first thing that caught its eye was the Spear of Purity rolling down the hill.", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "Little Chick\u2019s beak dropped open when it saw Seol Jihu. The left hand that was holding onto the Spear of Purity sagged down helplessly.", "Behind his half-closed, half-opened eyes were dim pupils that lost their light, and his swaying body leaned to one side.", "His hair fluttered ceaselessly, and\u2026", "\u2018Hmm?\u2019", "Seol Jihu opened his eyes after a few blinks. He\u2019d lost consciousness again for a moment, and the scenery changed.", "Petals were fluttering in a beautiful garden.", "\u2018This is\u2026.\u2019", "Just as he recognized the place, the scenery quickly changed.", "He saw the hill again.", "\u2018Did I see wrong\u2026?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tilted his head before suddenly widening his eyes.", "\u2018Anyway, when did this path get\u2026 huh?\u2019", "When he raised his eyes and looked up, he couldn\u2019t hide his shock.", "\u2018Huuuuh?\u2019", "Above the hill, he saw the scenery he wanted to see more than anything else.", "There weren\u2019t just one or two people there. More than a dozen people were looking down at him.", "\u2018Everyone\u2026!\u2019", "Baek Haeju, no, Yoo Seonhwa was looking at him with her hands clasped together.", "Kazuki was crossing his arms with a calm face.", "Maria was shaking her broken artifact and shouting something angrily.", "Teresa was smiling elegantly and winking.", "Philip Muller, who was sitting down reading his book, raised his body and closed the book.", "Eun Yuri waved her hand with an expressionless face, and Marcel Ghionea raised his crossbow with an awkward smile.", "Agnes pushed her glasses up and eyed at him to hurry up, and Oh Rahee grinned while fiddling with the ends of her hair.", "Yi Seol-Ah was holding hands with Hoshino Urara and jumping up and down in joy, and Hugo was excitedly waving his hand as well. To say welcome home.", "Audrey Basler was shaking her head while looking at the trio. Meanwhile, Wu Lei and White Tiger were roaring with laughter.", "Chohong and Phi Sora looked a little annoyed. The two snorted and then simultaneously stretched their hands out. The way they were beckoning at him, they seemed to be telling him to hurry up.", "As Seol Jihu watched in a daze, the corner of his mouth curled up.", "\u2018They\u2019re all alive\u2026!\u2019", "Everyone had survived and was waiting for him to come back.", "Little Chick had not lied.", "Because at the center of the group was Seo Yuhui. She glared at Seol Jihu with reddened eyes before closing them. She then opened her eyes and revealed a bright smile.", "Inside the illuminating mirage, Seol Jihu clenched his fists.", "He became impatient and ran forward in a heat of passion, looking only at the summit.", "That was why he failed to see that his body was gradually turning faint, and that Roselle, who was quietly watching him from behind, closed her eyes with a look of pity.", "Not knowing anything, Seol Jihu laughed.", "He shouted with a beaming smile.", "\u201cI\u2026!\u201d", "Then\u2026.", "Koong.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s body fell flat on the hill.", "Then, it no longer moved.", "His foot, which he raised with great difficulty, did not complete its step.", "Little Chick stood blankly for a second. After doubting its eyes, it rushed back down.", "\u201cO\u2026 Oi!\u201d", "It stuttered.", "\u201cOi\u2026!\u201d", "There was no reply.", "\u201c\u2026Partner!\u201d", "Seol Jihu did not move in the slightest.", "A shimmering ripple stirred in its pupils. Its beak convulsed as well.", "\u201cHey, you\u2026!\u201d", "In that instant, Little Chick shut its beak in the middle of shouting something. It clenched hard as if to break its teeth.", "\u201cKeuk\u2026!\u201d", "Its face contorted to an indescribable degree, and it dropped its head.", "Soon, a faint light began to rise from Little Chick\u2019s body.", "\u2026In truth, Little Chick already knew.", "It knew what would happen long before it discovered Seol Jihu\u2019s body.", "Though the Arcus Spirit was an immortal phoenix, its life was not eternal. It would meet its end, along with the death of its lifelong partner, and return to its egg form to await a new master.", "Little Chick knew what state its body was in during the search. It just didn\u2019t want to believe it.", "Because\u2026 because\u2026.", "\u201cGet up\u2026.\u201d", "Little Chick curled up and shook intensely.", "\u201cGet up\u2026 ya bastard\u2026!\u201d", "Tears streamed down from its dropped head.", "\u201cYou always got back up\u2026!
