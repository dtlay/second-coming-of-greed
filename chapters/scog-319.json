A chilling silence descended.

The pressure was so terrifyingly heavy that it made the man\u2019s lips tremble as if electrified.", "After giving a deathly glare for a while, Charlotte Aria slowly leaned forward. Then, she asked.", "\u201cWhat is the reason?\u201d", "The man couldn\u2019t answer. He was incapable of opening his mouth. His spirit was already crushed to the bottom, and he had a strong, ominous hunch that things would not end well if he gave the wrong answer.", "He truly felt this in his bones. Though he might be mistaken, the Queen\u2019s eyes seemed to be crackling with a sharp glint of lightning.", "\u201cSome are risking their lives and sticking their necks out for something that earns them no recognition.

Or are you asking this when you already know the answer? \u2026Well, it must be the latter.\u201d", "Charlotte Aria scoffed as if she heard the most ridiculous thing.", "\u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you. The Parasites have attacked the Federation. The point of invasion is close to Eva, and the Federation is currently in a close relationship with humanity. If Tigol Fortress falls, the Parasite\u2019s next target is obvious.\u201d", "She spoke quickly, allowing for no interference.", "\u201cThe reason Eva could stay safe until now was because of the Federation\u2019s existence and Tigol Fortress standing strong.

I can\u2019t go because of this, I can\u2019t go because of that. The number of Earthlings talking about some extenuating circumstances and going back always skyrocketed in the time of war. This royal self is failing to understand this phenomenon.\u201d", "The rage on Charlotte Aria\u2019s face grew an inch deeper. She had recalled another infuriating matter while saying this.", "\u201c\u2026Some of you must have heard of the name, Jung Sua.\u201d", "Jung Sua. She was the representative of the Evangeline organization, the previous royal partner of the Eva Royal Family.", "\u201cShe was like that too. Whenever something happened, whenever we issued a draft call, she would tell me, \u2018I have an important appointment. I have no choice because a missing report came in. My one and only family member is ill and on the verge of dying.\u2019 She would give all sorts of excuses to go back. And she would surprisingly sneak back by the time everything was over.\u201d", "Kkadeuk!
