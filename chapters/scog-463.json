If they could come back alive, they would not only be recognized as heroes but would also be able to avoid being labeled cowards.", "At first, this made Seol Jihu a little bitter, but he soon changed his mind. This was, in fact, solid evidence that he had changed humanity.", "Humanity quickly responded to Valhalla's request for help, as it was something they were expecting.", "Haramark was the first to arrive.", "Jan Sactus led the troops to Eva on Teresa\u2019s behalf, and the Earthlings from Sicilia arrived next.", "Agnes benefited from the changes led by Seol Jihu and was appointed the Apostle of Superbia.
