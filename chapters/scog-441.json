{"cid": "441", "title": "Chapter 441. With One Spear and Two Legs (6)", "content": ["The shadow was Seol Jihu.", "One could tell at a glance that he was in a bad shape, and that was putting it nicely.", "Already exhausted from the earlier brawl, he looked even more grotesque now because of his body\u2019s rejection of divinity. Cracks that looked like spiderwebs covered the surface of his skin.", "But what mattered to Seol Jihu was that his body was still moving. He jumped out of the hole and shot forward toward the Parasite Queen like a bullet.", "The Parasite Queen stopped her hand and began to rouse her energy.", "She guessed that by now, the enemy would have figured out what their ultimate goal was. As if to prove her theory right, Seol Jihu\u2019s face was full of rage as he rushed toward her.", "Of course, he was bitter. He had planned to fight to the death and aimed to resurrect afterward, but the said method had just been rendered unusable.", "Now there was only one thing left on the Parasites\u2019 agenda: watch Seol Jihu struggle one last time before he met his end from which he would never recover.", "But this didn\u2019t mean they could let their guard down. Ironically, the enemy was more dangerous now than ever.", "[Stand back! Get as far away as possible!]", "The Parasite Queen alerted the Army Commanders who were about to jump into the scene.", "[I will deal with him myself.]", "As the queen stretched out her arm in front of her, Seol Jihu thrust his spear.", "Thud!", "Seol Jihu\u2019s body jerked to a halt. He saw that his spear had stopped in the air without even reaching the target.", "[I have no obligation to fight you.]", "A leisurely voice rang out.", "[You\u2019re still keeping at it even in that condition\u2026. You really are a mad dog.]", "[I presume you\u2019d like to take as many as you can before you return to nothing.]", "The Parasite Queen spread her fingers open.", "[Taking one or two Army Commanders with you may not be entirely impossible since you have accepted my energy, albeit forcefully.]", "\u201cKeuk\u2026!\u201d", "[But did you really think I would let you have your way?]", "She had already played all the cards in her hand. Now his death was only a matter of time. She had no reason to fight him at the risk of further depleting her precious resources.", "[I told you when you turned down my offer, that you\u2019d fight like a dog and die like a dog.]", "The Parasite Queen continued, enjoying the defiant look in Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes.", "[Fine, do squirm like a bug until you die. I cannot wait to see the look on your face when you fall without achieving a single thing.]", "A sneer bloomed at the corner of her mouth.", "Seol Jihu scowled defiantly. His left hand, wrapped tightly around his spear, trembled in anger.", "[That funny technique that distorts the law of causality\u2026 why don\u2019t you try that on me? Though I can\u2019t say for sure, it will work.]", "With a snort, the Parasite Queen was about to lift her chin, when suddenly\u2026.", "Woooong!", "\u2026A beam of golden light shot out of the Spear of Purity.", "The energy released from the spear was not just a regular sword qi. It was much bigger and much denser, like tens of thousands of sword qi condensed into one.", "Even as she mocked, the Parasite Queen never really let her guard down. Nevertheless, the sudden burst of energy took her by surprise.", "Level 8 Spear Demon, Secret Art \u2014 Reinforced Sword Qi.", "The golden reinforced qi tore through the invisible barrier like a scissor cutting paper.", "The Parasite Queen immediately turned around and released every bit of energy she had gathered.", "Kagagagak!", "The released energy crashed into the reinforced qi, bending its course. At the same time, the Parasite Queen quickly folded her left wing across her body. As a result, the spear shattered, not the queen\u2019s heart but only her left wing bone.", "It was then that a heavy sense of foreboding took hold of the Parasite Queen. She could feel the scar on her face throb. Strangely enough, she had experienced the same feeling back when she was defeated at Tigol Fortress.", "Feeling humiliated all over again, the Parasite Queen\u2019s right hand smacked Seol Jihu with great force.", "Slap!", "Blood scattering everywhere, Seol Jihu was once again thrown into the air by the power of the blow. He rolled on the ground a dozen times before finally coming to a halt.", "For a second, Seol Jihu lay utterly still like a corpse but soon raised his head and pulled himself up, pushing his left arm against the ground. The Parasite Queen was awestruck as she watched all this from afar.", "\u2018He used my divinity without even fully absorbing it\u2026.\u2019", "She wasn\u2019t wrong. Seol Jihu\u2019s mana was depleted, but the divinity she had inserted into him remained, and this was what he used to formulate the earlier attack. No wonder she felt threatened. It was her own energy.", "\u2018I was right.\u2019", "It had been a wise decision on her part to instruct the Army Commanders to stay put. At least four out of five of them would not have been able to avoid that attack, which could have led to their demise.", "The Parasite Queen decided to confront Seol Jihu head-on. The possibility of her defeat was almost nonexistent as long as she stayed inside the realm of her own building.", "But of course, her opponent had a plan of his own.", "Seol Jihu quickly glanced around in search of a new target. But already, the Army Commanders were moving as far away from him as possible as the queen had commanded.", "It was then.", "\u201cAh?\u201d", "\u201cStay still.\u201d", "Suddenly, Twisted Kindness grabbed Sung Shihyun in her arms, turned around, and quickly flew past Seol Jihu.", "Seol Jihu did not miss this opportunity. He immediately began to pursue them. The three soon became nothing more than distant dots.", "Twisted Kindness\u2019 flying speed, boosted by wind magic, was indeed very swift. But backed by divinity, Seol Jihu was even faster.", "Twisted Kindness ignored Sung Shihyun\u2019s protest and glanced behind her shoulder. Seol Jihu had almost caught up with them and was holding his spear above his head.", "When she saw that, she immediately recited the spell she had been preparing all along. The pair of Army Commanders disappeared before the Spear of Purity could reach them.", "Seol Jihu stopped and quickly looked around.", "Twisted Kindness was floating next to the Parasite Queen with Sung Shihyun in her arms.", "She seemed to have used the teleportation spell seconds before the spear reached her.", "Realizing that all his efforts were in vain, Seol Jihu trembled in anger.", "\u201cFuck you\u2026. How dare you use me as bait\u2026?\u201d", "Panting and gasping for breath, Sung Shihyun muttered in disdain.", "\u201cForgive me. I don\u2019t know why, but he looked like he was after you.\u201d", "Twisted Kindness gave a bleak smile.", "\u201cAnd it seems I was right. Do you see that confused look on his face?\u201d", "\u2014Kuaaaaaaaak!", "Suddenly, Seol Jihu\u2019s roar of rage echoed throughout the surrounding field.", "\u201cJeez\u2026.\u201d", "Instead of complaining, a silly laugh escaped Sung Shihyun\u2019s mouth. He did feel pleased. This almost felt like retaliation for Seol Jihu beating him earlier during their fight.", "And no wonder Seol Jihu was angry. His enemy played him, forcing him to waste his time when he never had much to begin with.", "[What are you doing over there?]", "The Parasite Queen responded to the roar.", "[Why don\u2019t you come at me so that I can punish you again? Or do you prefer to play tag with my children?]", "Her voice was full of ridicule. The Parasite Queen began to gather her energy again while waiting for the enemy to move.", "She thought Seol Jihu would come at her immediately as before, but to her surprise, he remained completely still.", "He only stared at the Parasite Queen and the five Army Commanders, his eyes blazing with rage, but his feet firmly planted on the ground.", "A brief silence passed.", "[?]", "All of a sudden, Seol Jihu did something totally unexpected.", "He turned and began to run in the opposite direction.", "[Hoh!]", "The Parasite Queen let out an exclamation of surprise.", "[You\u2019re running away?]", "She asked in a provocative tone, but Seol Jihu did not stop. He concentrated his inner fury on running away. It didn\u2019t take long for him to disappear completely beyond the horizon.", "[So he doesn't want to be played by us. What a pathetic pride he has!]", "The Parasite Queen snorted.", "\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d", "Sung Shihyun shouted in a hurry.", "\u201cYou\u2019re letting him get away?\u201d", "[Hmph\u2026.]", "The Parasite Queen lifted her head to the sky. Whatever she saw must have been good news, for an ecstatic smile lit up her face.", "[Running across the wilderness until he falls and dies a miserable death alone\u2026. Sounds like a death befitting a mad dog, don\u2019t you agree?]", "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d", "Sung Shihyun shook his head.", "\u201cWe have to capture him and kill him.\u201d", "[No, I won\u2019t allow that.]", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "[Our plan succeeded.]", "The Parasite Queen answered simply. She was indirectly emphasizing that Sung Shihyun no longer had the same authority as she did because their mission had been completed.", "[I understand why you want to make sure he\u2019s dead, but\u2026 you saw.]", "The queen continued.", "[You saw how I didn\u2019t let my guard down when he jumped out of that hole and tried to pierce my heart.]", "Yet the concentrated energy easily penetrated her barrier.", "[His power then was stronger than yours and that of the Seventh Army Commander. It even took me by surprise.]", "\u201cStill.\u201d", "[I already gave up the stele and spent extra energy for the sake of this mission. If I have to face him again, of course, I won\u2019t lose, but my divinity will suffer more damage.]", "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d", "[And if by any chance I\u2019m forced to spend the energy I\u2019m using to suppress the Oath\u2026. That will put a considerable restraint on what I can do in the future.]", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "[There\u2019s more. As you know, he\u2019s deceitful. Perhaps he wants you to follow him, just so that he can capture you.]", "Sung Shihyun closed his mouth.", "The Parasite Queen was right. He felt the wound on his chest throbbing. If the rampaging divinity were to be added to that technique\u2026. The mere thought of it caused a chill to run up his spine.", "The Parasite Queen lowered her gaze. When she saw Sung Shihyun biting his lip nervously, she put a hand on the top of his head, then pulled it back.", "Now looking up at the sky, Sung Shihyun widened his eyes. The view changed and he saw the universe. And then\u2026.", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "A light flickered in Sung Shihyun\u2019s eyes when he saw the star at the center of the celestial sphere.", "[Did you see it?]", "The Parasite Queen asked, and Sung Shihyun nodded. Now he looked much more at ease.", "\u201c\u2026That won\u2019t change all of a sudden, right?\u201d", "[The supernova is the brightest of all stars, but in reality, its brightness is caused by an explosion that the star produces at the end of its life.]", "The Parasite Queen removed her hand from Sung Shihyun\u2019s head.", "[The exploded star can then become a nebula, a neutron star, or a black hole\u2026. And the star has made its choice. It\u2019s a fate chosen by none other than the supernova itself. Therefore, it will not change.]", "She said in a voice full of confidence.", "\u2018The supernova itself\u2026.\u2019", "Sung Shihyun\u2019s face fell. Somehow that phrase bothered him, but he quickly shook his head. The person he saw and experienced couldn\u2019t have been anyone other than Seol Jihu.", "\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d", "[Good.]", "Seeing that Sung Shihyun was convinced, the Parasite Queen turned around.", "[As much as I\u2019d like to praise you for the mission\u2019s success, your work is not yet done.]", "Her next goal was to exterminate the insects invading her territory.", "*", "Black Seol Jihu ran.", "Ever since he turned around, he had been running as fast as he could. He even blocked off his senses to the point that his legs began to shake. He had to get as far away from the enemy as possible, all to prepare for the future.", "Before jumping out of the hole, Black Seol Jihu assessed the situation calmly. No matter what decision he made, the fact that he had to risk his life remained unchanged. But even if he chose to confront the Parasite Queen, could he have achieved results corresponding to his efforts?", "\u2018No,\u2019 thought Black Seol Jihu. The enemy wasn\u2019t stupid. The Parasite Queen he knew, tended to make the most rational decisions under the given circumstances. Sometimes she could be surprisingly bold, but she played safe most of the time and made only logical choices.", "This time too, the Parasite Queen ordered the Army Commanders to step down. And then she raised her guard because she knew if she could just run out the clock, Seol Jihu would die without her having to exhaust her resources further.", "If he had chosen to fight her? Then he could have injured her to some extent, but in no way was that a reward enough for him to give up his right to resurrect. So Black Seol Jihu chose the latter \u2014 to flee.", "He used the reinforced sword qi as a kind of provocation. Everything that the Parasite Queen did was within his expectations. And Black Seol Jihu ran away only after pretending to fight to ensure that the enemy wouldn\u2019t suspect escape had been his goal from the start.", "\u2018I don\u2019t think they\u2019re chasing me\u2026.\u2019", "Black Seol Jihu organized his thoughts as he ran.", "What had already happened could not be undone. The past could not be changed, but the future could. It all depended on what he would do from now on.", "Seol Jihu was going to die soon. To return to Paradise, he needed one wish. The problem was that the Parasite Queen had completely damaged Seol Jihu\u2019s body. He had to fix this problem first to make his resurrection worthwhile.", "It should be noted here that the Parasite Queen\u2019s level of existence was higher than that of the Seven Gods. And this gap between them had widened even further after she devoured the Chief Deity.", "It was simple, really. The resurrection setting as created by the Seven Sins, restored the Earthlings to the state they were in just before their death.", "If the Parasite Queen\u2019s divinity had been the cause of his death, he wouldn\u2019t have worried at all. He could just die and then resurrect.", "But the Parasite Queen was extremely meticulous. She made sure that the Army Commanders\u2019 attack, and not her divinity, became the primary cause of Seol Jihu\u2019s death.", "She also used the loophole in the resurrection setting to inject him with just the right amount of divinity, just enough not to kill him directly.", "This meant that even if he were resurrected, the queen\u2019s divinity would still remain inside Seol Jihu\u2019s body. Therefore, he would need to rely on wishes to bring his body back to normal.", "But Black Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t tell exactly how many he would need. In the worst-case scenario, even two wouldn\u2019t be enough. Resurrecting according to the rules set by the law of causality, and erasing the Parasite Queen\u2019s divinity with the power of the Seven Sins were, after all, completely different matters.", "\u2018He could probably manage to get one. But if he needed more than that\u2026.\u2019", "It was unrealistic to assume that Seol Jihu could secure more than one wish. He wasn\u2019t even sure if he could get one.", "The more Black Seol Jihu thought, the clearer it became that he had to somehow extinguish the foreign energy dwelling inside him before he died. Even if he couldn\u2019t remove it altogether, he had to reduce it as much as possible before time ran out.", "Crash!", "Black Seol Jihu\u2019s train of thought continued endlessly until he suddenly fell and rolled over the rough surface of the ground beneath him.", "\u201cFuck\u2026.\u201d", "With his face buried in the ground, Black Seol Jihu cursed softly.", "\u2018I feel like I\u2019ve come pretty far\u2026.\u2019", "He managed to raise his upper body and look behind his shoulder.", "After a brief moment of thought\u2026.", "\u2018I should probably get started now. I can feel my strength draining\u2026.\u2019", "Black Seol Jihu slowly extended his arm into the air. He took a transparent box out of his Dimensional Pocket.", "[Harmonia Magic Square]\u2026Because the formula was made with the reversal of energies in mind, it cannot be said to be perfect. But despite being an imperfect formula, if the user accepts the risk and attempts to control it, they will be able to \u2018temporarily\u2019 control conflicting energies.The energy of \u2018Absolute Evil\u2019 is currently rampaging inside the crystal.", "Black Seol Jihu read the explanation carefully. This crystal was the reason he chose the latter.", "On the Path of the Soul, he had repeatedly told Seol Jihu never to use it, but\u2026.", "\u2018Who knew I\u2019d end up here?\u2019", "Black Seol Jihu gave a bitter smile. He would have liked to think a little more, but there was no time.", "\u2018Funny how my entire life is a gamble.\u2019", "Black Seol Jihu briefly complained to himself before slumping down into a sitting position. He took a deep breath, then injected his mana into the box.", "Flash! The magic square drawn on the crystal began to emit a bright light.", "Black Seol Jihu closed his eyes and focused on the flow of energy. Soon he felt the energy from the Harmonia Magic Square \u2014 Absolute Evil, the mixture of all the essence of the Seven Sins \u2014 slowly flow into him.", "He focused all his attention on the process at hand. From here on out, even the smallest mistake could become the point of no return.", "With the use of the Harmonia Magic Square, there were now a total of three energies inside Seol Jihu.", "The essence of lightning, the Parasite Queen\u2019s divinity, and Absolute Evil.", "Black Seol Jihu plunged into contemplation.", "There was no doubt in his mind that if he left the divinity and Absolute Evil alone, they would unite as one and become an entirely new force.", "But this fragile body would never be able to contain such enormous power. Even now, it was on the verge of collapse, so it wasn\u2019t at all difficult to imagine what would happen if the divinity became stronger than it was now.", "\u2018I shouldn\u2019t let the two forces coexist.\u2019", "After all, this act itself was enough of a gamble. Black Seol Jihu decided to proceed as originally planned. He chose neutralization over coexistence.", "When Black Seol Jihu made up his mind, he immediately activated his Mana Cultivation Method.", "Level 8 Spear Demon, Class Ability \u2014 Reverse-Flow Mana Technique.", "Harmonia Magic Square forced two conflicting energies to coexist, and through the repulsion forces generated by such an act, it allowed its user to use reverse-flow mana.", "Black Seol Jihu planned to use his technique on the two energies other than the divinity.", "In other words, he was reversing what had already been reversed. Turn 180 degrees twice in a row, and you end up right where you started.", "Which could only mean\u2026.", "BOOM!", "Black Seol Jihu\u2019s upper body swung back and forth.", "\u201cKeuk!\u201d", "Blood spurted from his nose. At first, the two energies seemed to be in harmony, but the peace did not last long. One of the two energies began to shake violently against the other.", "\u201cUaaargh\u2026!\u201d", "Even while barely holding out, Black Seol Jihu knew instinctively that his decision was right.", "In terms of quantity, the queen\u2019s divinity was the smallest. But it was the densest and most powerful of all the energies in his body. In spite of the fierce attack of Absolute Evil, which was the concentration of seven darknesses, it didn\u2019t even budge. Rather, the divinity swallowed the evil each time it came near.", "Black Seol Jihu\u2019s face slowly warped into a frown.", "\u2018Even though I\u2019ve blocked my senses\u2026!\u2019", "As his circuits and blood vessels ruptured, indescribable pain swirled through his body like a tsunami. His body began to swell, and blood gushed from the wounds that had yet to heal.", "Suddenly, intense dizziness overtook him. His head hurt and he felt lightheaded. As drops of sweat began to fall down his face, he thought he might really die from excessive bleeding.", "\u2018In my past life\u2026 this was nothing\u2026!\u2019", "Black Seol Jihu clenched his teeth. He activated the Reverse-Flow Mana Technique to help boost Absolute Evil fighting relentlessly against the Parasite Queen\u2019s divinity.", "\u2018Endure it\u2026!\u2019", "A moment later, two strands of energy, one black and one white, spewed out of Seol Jihu\u2019s body like a hurricane. The strands intertwined in a spiral and began to surround the body from which they came.", "A fierce tug-of-war ensued. Whenever the light and the darkness collided, they neutralized each other and disappeared. Most of the two energies were lost as this cycle continued, but a few remaining quantities were absorbed back into Seol Jihu\u2019s body.", "Kwang! Kwang! Kwang!", "As time went by, the clashes intensified, and Black Seol Jihu\u2019s face turned paler and paler.", "And yet, he remained perfectly still. It was his request that put his only friend in this position. This was the least he could do for him.", "He focused on continuing the Reverse-Flow Mana Technique for the longest time until the two energies finally subsided.", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "Black Seol Jihu slowly opened his eyes.", "Not even an hour had passed, yet he looked at least ten years older.", "He stared straight ahead with a dazed look before suddenly shivering.", "He felt empty now that everything that had filled him had disappeared.", "\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d", "With a grunt, he wiped the blood dripping from his mouth with the back of his hand. He felt as if he had died a dozen times and returned to life each time, without exaggeration.", "\u2018Did it work\u2026?\u2019", "There was no way to know for sure. The only certain thing was that the Harmonia Magic Square had all his circuits distorted.", "Still, that was a thousand times better than keeping the Parasite Queen\u2019s divinity in him. All his insides had been brutally butchered, but his body was in tatters long before he used the magic square. He should be rejoicing that he managed to do something before it was too late.", "\u2018I did everything I could.\u2019", "Now the rest was up to Seol Jihu and his comrades.", "Black Seol Jihu dropped his head with a sigh. He felt light as if he had just been freed from a heavy burden.", "\u2018\u2026Should I lie down now?\u2019", "Suddenly, Black Seol Jihu broke into a chuckle. He noticed that, contrary to his wish, his body was squirming to get up.", "\u2018Alright, alright, I get it.\u2019", "He staggered to his feet and suddenly blinked. Only now did he realize that a couple of messages were floating in the air.", "\u2018Well\u2026 I guess this is nothing to be surprised about considering the number of times I got punched\u2026. Wait a minute, what comes after EX again\u2026?\u2019", "Black Seol Jihu gave a bitter smile. He leaned against his spear and let out a long breath.", "\u2018I\u2019m so tired\u2026.\u2019", "He wanted nothing more than just to lie down and close his eyes. But the owner of his body wanted him to get up and walk.", "\u2018You\u2019re really something.\u2019", "He seemed to want to go back alive no matter what.", "\u2018Fine. Let\u2019s go\u2026.\u2019", "Black Seol Jihu took a step forward, using his spear as a cane.", "But before long, his consciousness began to fade and his sight blurred.", "He looked down at his own body with half-closed eyes.", "His lips curled into a weak smile.", "\u201cGood job\u2026.\u201d", "Muttering to himself, he walked step by step toward the horizon.", "\u201cYou did well\u2026.\u201d", "He walked across the field that no one knew the name of, his legs shaking under him.", "\u201cReally\u2026.\u201d", "Alone and desolate, he walked\u2026.", "With one spear and two legs."]}
