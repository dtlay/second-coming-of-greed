{"cid": "203", "title": "Chapter 203. Chohong\u2019s Vow (1)", "content": ["News quickly spread about Seo Yuhui leaving the intensive care unit, but the Temple of Luxuria stayed silent. It seemed like it was just yesterday that they threw a fit about having to find the perpetrators, but they suddenly went silent, as if a bucket of cold water was poured on a sizzling grill.", "It was rather suspicious given that the timing coincided with the news report published by the Assassins\u2019 Guild, and anyone who was at least a little knowledgeable in the ways of Paradise would know that some sort of scheming was involved, but no one dared to say anything so rashly.", "The Temple of Luxuria was an organization of healing Priests and was the second most powerful union after the Magician\u2019s Guild. No one wanted to be on their bad side, and justifiably so.", "Their influence was so great that even the Assassins\u2019 Guild feared them, not publishing the fact that they tried to take Seol Jihu forcefully.", "Of course, people even cursed their own countries if no one was watching, so it wasn\u2019t as if no one was voicing a word of complaint.", "\u201cI just don\u2019t understand that noonim.\u201d", "Jang Maldong glanced at Chohong, who was sitting on the couch, constantly grumbling and smoking.", "\u201cIf she\u2019s up, she should have learned what happened. Shouldn\u2019t she take necessary measures to fix this situation? It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve known each other for only a few days.\u201d", "Recently, Chohong had been complaining nonstop. She didn\u2019t like this, she didn\u2019t like that. She complained so much that scabs formed over everyone\u2019s ears.", "\u201cShouldn\u2019t she at least bring those sons of bitches who threatened us over and force them to apologize? Ah, just thinking about it is making me angry again.\u201d", "Jang Maldong snorted.", "A class that was treated like nobles along with the Magicians, apologizing?", "There wasn\u2019t a rule saying they couldn\u2019t. Even Priests specializing in healing would have to bow their heads to some people.", "The problem was that they would never do such a thing to a small team like Carpe Diem. Not unless they were as influential and large as Sicilia.", "\u201cUaaaaah\u2014!\u201d", "Unable to restrain her anger, Chohong screamed once again.", "Jang Maldong wanted to tell her to shut up, but he held himself back. He knew how shitty it felt to be swayed by the enemy.", "Jang Maldong sighed before saying.", "\u201cDon\u2019t blame her. She won\u2019t be able to do anything even if she wanted to.\u201d", "\u201cWhat does that mean? She\u2019s the Executor of Lust! Isn\u2019t she this in the Temple of Luxuria?\u201d", "Chohong raised her thumb and rebutted, and Jang Maldong shook his head gravely.", "\u201cShe used to be.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t she return during the war?\u201d", "\u201cTo be precise, she retracted her withdrawal. She didn\u2019t regain all of the influence she had when she was in her prime. In the first place, she let go of all those things when she retired\u2026\u201d", "He didn\u2019t finish saying, \u2018It would be hard to regain the authority she gave up\u2019, but Chohong understood what he meant and scratched her head.", "\u201cAiya~ What a shame for someone whose name is a legend in itself.\u201d", "\u201cWell, given her name value, it isn\u2019t as if she lost all of her supporters. But her ability as an Executor has been sealed, and she can\u2019t use any of her skills as a Unique Ranker Priest, so she\u2019s the perfect target for the people who are only seeking benefits.\u201d", "\u201cJeez, what a mess they are.\u201d", "When Jang Maldong smiled bitterly, Chohong smacked her lips.", "In truth, Chohong knew what situation Seo Yuhui was in and even empathized with her to a certain extent. After all, she had also entered Paradise as a Red Mark and experienced all sorts of dirty schemes to climb up to her current position.", "There were times she had to say thanks when she should have been thanked, and there were likewise times she had to apologize when she should have received an apology.", "This was precisely such a situation.", "\u201cThis goddamned world. I guess it\u2019s my fault for not being strong enough.\u201d", "Chohong swallowed her anger before looking side to side and blurting out.", "\u201cAnd where did he go?\u201d", "Jang Maldong crossed his arms and gestured at the building beyond the window.", "\u201cHe said he\u2019d visit our neighbor.\u201d", "Same time.", "\u201cEh?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui, who returned home, was looking at a visitor with a flustered face.", "\u201cWhat did you\u2026 say?\u201d", "When she carefully asked again\u2026", "\u201cWhat do I have to do to restore Noona\u2019s abilities?\u201d", "Seol Jihu repeated what he just said without missing a single beat.", "Seo Yuhui gently closed her eyes.", "\u201cSo he told you.\u201d", "She had pleaded with Jang Maldong to keep this matter a secret, but she knew Seol Jihu wouldn\u2019t have let him get away without a proper explanation, given the incident that had just occurred.", "Seo Yuhui waved her hand with an awkward smile.", "\u201cThat\u2019s something for me to take care of. I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re worried about me, but you don\u2019t have to bother with it.\u201d", "And with that, she put on an apologetic look.", "\u201cSorry, because of me\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head, seeing as how Seo Yuhui couldn\u2019t finish her sentence.", "\u201cI think I\u2019m the cause of this incident.\u201d", "\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d", "Seol Jihu shook his head once again.", "\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the Priests barging into Carpe Diem\u2019s office. I\u2019m talking about you being attacked.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui stared at the young man, who was clearly voicing his thoughts. She was shocked speechless when she first heard what happened and thought he would be gravely distressed, but he seemed rather collected.", "He must have forgotten about the matter or be enduring it.", "Or perhaps he had another idea altogether.", "Regardless, it didn\u2019t look like he would back down.", "\u201cI have no problem carrying out my daily activities\u2026\u201d", "\u201cNot if you consider your outside factors.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui secretly let out a sigh with Seol Jihu being so adamant. She could tell that he had already made up his mind. Unable to win against Seol Jihu, Seo Yuhui confessed.", "\u201cOkay\u2026 it looks like you already heard, but I\u2019ll tell you about it in more detail. Most of my abilities have been sealed from the recoil of the Ceremony I held. I can\u2019t say for sure, but I\u2019m currently equal to a Level 1 or 2 Priest.\u201d", "\u2018Level 1 or 2 Priest!?\u2019", "Seol Jihu swallowed hard. Seo Yuhui was in a worse state than he imagined. At the same time, he admired her for being able to remain so calm and unperturbed.", "Something terrible might have happened to her, yet he couldn\u2019t see a single hint of animosity or resentment from her.", "\u201cIt\u2019s easy for me to heal. I just have to make offerings to Goddess Luxuria.\u201d", "The answer Seol Jihu had been waiting for finally came out.", "\u201cOfferings?\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. He had expected her meridians to be blocked or her mana circuit to be broken, but offerings? It was an entirely new concept as far as he was concerned.", "\u201cPriests are different from other classes in how closely related they are to their gods.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui explained gently like a teacher educating a child, and it was only then that Seol Jihu remembered all Priests carried around offerings and an altar.", "Maria did so, and so did Alex. This was partly to prepare spells beforehand like Magicians did with their Memorize spell, more fundamentally\u2026", "\u2018Priests borrow the authority of their gods directly, so they have to pay the price each time. Was that it?\u2019", "While Seol Jihu struggled to remember what little he knew about the Priest class, Seo Yuhui\u2019s explanation continued.", "\u201cSeparate from the condition of my body and the cost I paid for the Ceremony, I borrowed and used more divine power than what I was permitted. My abilities were sealed because of it.\u201d", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s jaw dropped. It was clear how to restore Seo Yuhui\u2019s abilities \u2014 to pay the equivalent amount of offerings as the power Seo Yuhui borrowed at the time.", "\u201cI gave all the offerings I gathered so far\u2026 but I didn\u2019t recover as much as I thought.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took a moment to organize his thoughts before speaking.", "\u201cWhat exactly are offerings?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026 gods have their own preferences for offerings\u2026 but Luxuria-nim isn\u2019t really picky. She likes offerings with holy power the most, though.\u201d", "Seol Jihu raised a question.", "\u201cThen how much holy power should an offering have to fully restore your power?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026\u201d", "Seo Yuhui crossed her arms and tilted her head.", "\u201cIf I have something like the Moirai\u2019s Souvenir, I think I\u2019ll be able to recover my strength in one go\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes widened.", "\u2018Moirai\u2019s Souvenir\u2026.\u2019", "That was an item that was sold at the Neutral Zone for Survival Points. Seol Jihu clearly remembered this item as it was the most expensive item among the available items in the VIP Shop.", "Seo Yuhui saw Seol Jihu\u2019s face and smiled faintly.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Offerings are just the fastest way to restore my power. It\u2019s not the only way. Though it will take more time, I can also recover by going to the temple and praying.\u201d", "Seol Jihu made up his mind when he heard this comment from Seo Yuhui.", "With this incident, he saw the dark side of Paradise clearly and learned many things. Not all humans were on the same side. Some were hidden enemies, who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to turn their spears if it benefited them.", "In other words, he couldn\u2019t guarantee that it would be safe to remain on the humans\u2019 side. Even the Temple of Luxuria could be compromised.", "Because of this, Seol Jihu spoke up.", "\u201cI have a request for you, Noona.\u201d", "\u201cHm? What is it?\u201d", "What was making him so serious? Seo Yuhui blinked her eyes curiously.", "\u201cYou said you can recover your strength by going to the temple and praying, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good choice.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, I\u2019m sure you have your own thoughts about this issue, and I\u2019m sure you have many supporters as well. But\u2026 I can\u2019t help but think that going to the Temple of Luxuria will be like marching into enemy territory. You might get attacked again soon.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui neither confirmed nor denied Seol Jihu\u2019s suspicion. Seol Jihu took her silence as a sign of agreement.", "\u201cI\u2019ll be straight. Won\u2019t you team up with Carpe Diem for a while?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s eyes widened. It seemed this was completely out of her expectations.", "The Iron Wall. Seol Jihu knew what Seo Yuhui was called in Paradise. He quickly added, so that she wouldn\u2019t misunderstand.", "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pressure you or force you in any way. I won\u2019t mention it again if you say no.\u201d", "\u201cW-Wait. I won\u2019t really be of any help right now\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not expecting any. I\u2019m not trying to recruit you. Just think of Carpe Diem as a place to rest while you recover.\u201d", "Seol Jihu paused for a moment before continuing softly.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m too indebted to you. I want to pay you back no matter what.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s lips pursed. The way her eyes blinked incessantly, she seemed more than a little flustered.", "Seol Jihu fell in thought. \u2018Let\u2019s work together to find offerings. That\u2019s the safest and the quickest way of recovery.\u2019 There were many things he wanted to say, but he swallowed his words.", "Revealing his honest feelings seemed to be the best choice. So that\u2019s what he did.", "\u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d", "It was then.", "The flustered Seo Yuhui\u2019s eyes widened slightly. She took a deep breath, and her snow-white neck turned red like a river reflecting a sunset.", "Coughing meaninglessly, Seo Yuhui muttered quietly.", "\u201c\u2026I see your sudden catches still haven\u2019t changed.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, Seo Yuhui calmly collected her breath. She truly looked like someone who was struggling to calm down.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll give me some time to think, right?\u201d", "\u201cOf course!\u201d", "Seol Jihu replied as if it was the most obvious answer.", "He hadn\u2019t expected her to answer immediately anyways, and in his perspective, Seo Yuhui seemed to have doubts.", "Was he being thoughtless and impudent?", "Seol Jihu\u2019s intent was clear. Rather than staying in a place surrounded by enemies, he was telling Seo Yuhui to rely on him and receive thorough protection.", "It wasn\u2019t just empty words considering that Carpe Diem was the undisputed best team in Haramark. The problem was that Seo Yuhui joining Carpe Diem would result in Seol Jihu making even more enemies.", "The meaning of embracing Seo Yuhui in Paradise\u2014 Seol Jihu didn\u2019t quite know this as his thoughts were mostly on repaying his debt to Seo Yuhui according to the Golden Rule.", "Soon, the sound of Seol Jihu getting up was heard.", "\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui opened her eyes in a fluster.", "\u201cH-Hm? Ah, you\u2019re leaving?\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head. He was worried that his offer would have made her uncomfortable, but she seemed strangely happy.", "\u201cYes, and\u2014\u201d", "Standing up, Seol Jihu continued.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. We\u2019ll find the culprits.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui smiled softly.", "\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself too much. They won\u2019t be easy opponents.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t plan to rush this at all.\u201d", "With a bright reply, Seol Jihu bowed before turning around. And soon\u2026 Tak, the moment the sound of door closing rang out, the brightly smiling Seo Yuhui immediately turned solemn.", "When she heaved out the breath she had been holding in, the redness she had been suppressing slowly crept up and spread. Her face reddening in an instant, Seo Yuhui put her hands over her cheeks to cool them down.", "\u2018What do I do\u2026\u2019", "Possessed by a severe internal conflict, the young man\u2019s words from the past suddenly crossed her mind.", "[Let me protect you.]", "Shutting her eyes, Seo Yuhui reflexively put her hand over her left chest. She could clearly feel the throbbing of her pulsating heart.", "\u2018Why did he have to say that all of a sudden\u2026.\u2019", "Although she looked like she was embarrassed\u2026", "\u2018Jeez\u2026\u2019", "Seo Yuhui had to try her best to suppress the corners of her mouth from curling up."]}
