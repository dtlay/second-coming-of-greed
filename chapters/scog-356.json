I know what you are trying to say, but you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d", "Kim Hannah said firmly and straightforwardly.", "Jang Maldong scoffed.", "\u201cI did not think you were so incompetent, Miss Kim Hannah.\u201d", "\u201cI appreciate your compliment, but\u2026\u201d", "\u201cOf course, Seol Jihu is the one who spent the money carelessly. But was it so hard to give him a word of advice? That he should take only a little bit home at a time because his family might get suspicious?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d", "\u201cFine. Let us suppose you did not know Jihu would act so thoughtlessly. Right, you might feel that you\u2019re being unfairly accused. But I want to know. This incident worsened Jihu\u2019s already bad relationship with his family, so what was the reason that you forced him to visit them with wine?\u201d", "\u201cI admit that the way I approached the problem was wrong. But\u2014\u201d", "\u201cYes, it was wrong. It was very wrong. But that isn\u2019t what I am asking.\u201d", "Jang Maldong said in a seething voice.", "There was a reason he was pressing her so much.", "The most important step in resolving a problem was the way it was handled initially.", "In a way, the problem with Seol Jihu\u2019s relationship with his family could have been solved smoothly. Even if it wouldn\u2019t have been easy, it at least could have improved to a much better state than it currently was.", "But because Seol Jihu took the wrong first step, his family relationship had deteriorated to an almost irreversible state.", "Examining why it became so bad, the cause could be found in Kim Hannah\u2019s intervention.", "Of course, she might be innocent.", "But Jang Maldong had to suspect her at least a little bit because he knew how meticulous she usually was.", "That perhaps, Kim Hannah had led the situation to worsen with some purpose\u2026", "\u201cAt the time, I thought that was for the best.\u201d", "Kim Hannah spoke at that moment.", "\u201cDo you remember the Delphinion Duchy Laboratory incident?\u201d", "Jang Maldong raised an eyebrow at the sudden mention of a past event.", "He certainly knew about the incident but could not understand why she was bringing it up.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that incident, actually. The Forest of Denial expedition, the Arden Valley Baiting operation, the Delphinion Laboratory Infiltration mission\u2026 Jihu constantly put himself in situations of extreme danger that other low-leveled Earthlings would not even think of. Without even telling me, his Inviter.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s voice was calm and collected as she recounted the past, and she continued with a firm voice.", "\u201cIt might have been a coincidence the first or the second time. But when the same thing happens a third time, it can no longer be a coincidence. While adapting to the unfamiliar environment quickly, Jihu was falling into Paradise quicker than anyone else. From all the way back then.\u201d", "\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you did what you did because you were afraid of his Paradise addiction?\u201d", "\u201cBecause what I feared became a reality.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smacked her lips and answered.", "\u201cI told him over and over again that Paradise was not where he belonged, but he didn\u2019t listen. In fact, whenever he went back to Earth, he looked like he wanted to return to Paradise as quickly as possible.\u201d", "Kim Hannah sighed.", "\u201cIt was complicated. Jihu acted carelessly and escalated the severity of the problem, but then he avoided the problem and tried to go back to Paradise\u2026 I judged that his relationship with his family would become irreparable if left alone, so I made him visit them using the wedding anniversary as an excuse. Because at the time, his family was the only place on Earth where he might find peace.\u201d", "Jang Maldong flashed his eyes glaringly but still listened silently.", "\u201cYou might think it was too hasty, Master Jang, but Jihu did not show any withdrawal symptoms that addicts often experience. He didn\u2019t even mention anything about gambling after experiencing everything he went through in Paradise. It was as if he was never a gambling addict to begin with\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah was saying that the rate at which Seol Jihu got addicted to Paradise was beyond anyone\u2019s imagination.", "\u201cJihu was reluctant to leave once he entered Paradise. I did think that it would be better if he took the time to get closer to his family, but that conflicted with him hurriedly needing a place of rest on Earth. In the end, I decided it was better for him to meet his family rather than growing farther apart.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, I admit that I was too hasty. That was my mistake.\u201d", "\u201cI see what you\u2019re saying.\u201d", "Jang Maldong raised his chin and looked down at Kim Hannah.", "\u201cBut am I wrong in thinking that you are trying to package what happened in your favor?\u201d", "\u201cMaster Jang.\u201d", "\u201cEven a monkey can fall from a tree, but Miss Foxy making a mistake? I find that too hard to believe on its own.\u201d", "\u201cI am human too. I\u2019m not saying what I did was right, but I can\u2019t be perfect all the time. Otherwise, I would still be holding onto my position in Sinyoung rather than being in this place right now.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled faintly.", "\u201cLooking back, I\u2019ve always made mistakes when it came to Jihu.\u201d", "She cleared her throat and continued.", "\u201cIf I may reveal my honest thoughts\u2026 you\u2019re right. I tried to control Jihu.\u201d", "\u201cControl?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t think too badly of it. The Jihu from back then had a slew of problems both in Paradise and on Earth.\u201d", "Kim Hannah continued.", "\u201cI know that the current Jihu has accomplished great things that make him comparable to the legends of Paradise. But if you set them aside and only look at him as just another person, Jihu is the type of guy who needs a meticulous producer. I\u2019m sure you understand what I mean as his master.\u201d", "Then, Kim Hannah smiled bitterly.", "\u201cBut\u2026 Jihu couldn\u2019t be controlled.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI felt it in my gut the first day we came to Eva. That Jihu could not be controlled. My mistake was in realizing this too late.\u201d", "Kim Hannah let loose a deep sigh. Jang Maldong didn\u2019t say anything. He simply kept Kim Hannah bound to the same spot with a silent gaze.", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d", "Jang Maldong spoke up after a moment of silence.", "\u201cBut I cannot see you, Miss Kim Hannah, in a good way.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I\u2018ve had the feeling that you do not like me.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you know why. When you allied with the Triads and acted without saying a word to Jihu, I didn\u2019t say anything because I knew it was for his own good\u2026 But I\u2019ve always felt uncomfortable about it.\u201d", "\u201cI understand. There are other members that hate me for that matter as well. I did it, fully aware of the consequences.\u201d", "\u201cYes. I know what you\u2019ve done for Jihu so far, and so I\u2019ll overlook the matter with his family as something that you judged to be in his best interest. But know that this will be the last time.\u201d", "Jang Maldong emphasized that there would not be a next time.", "That this was his bottom line and he would not sit still if she tried to interfere again.", "Kim Hannah was no fool, and she quickly understood his intention.", "\u201cIf you want to prove your innocence, you will have to show me through your actions. Especially when it comes to the matter regarding Jihu\u2019s family.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. Jihu already told me last time that he would take care of it on his own. I agreed with him as well.\u201d", "\u201cI hope you take responsibility for those words.\u201d", "That was all.", "Jang Maldong took his eyes off Kim Hannah once she gave the affirmation that she took her hands off of Seol Jihu\u2019s family matter.", "He turned around and continued walking.", "He had mixed feelings all the way until he arrived at the Valhalla building.", "Seol Jihu was the only thing on his mind.", "It was then.", "Jang Maldong caught sight of someone as he went inside while still deep in thought.", "Phi Sora was sitting in the lounge area, eating a sherbet.", "An idea must have sparked inside Jang Maldong\u2019s head at that moment as he suddenly raised his voice.", "\u201cSora!\u201d", "\u201cWhadda what!?\u201d", "When he suddenly shouted, the joyously humming Phi Sora threw the spoon in her hand in a startle.", "She turned to the side, furrowed her brows, and spat out a breath.", "\u201cGrandpa?\u201d", "\u201cCome here for a bit.\u201d", "\u201cWhy\u2019d you shout!? You scared the living crap out of me!\u201d", "\u201cSince when were you so easily scared? Anyway, get over here! I need to tell you something.\u201d", "\u201cUgh, I was in such a good mood too\u2026 What annoying job is he gonna make me do this time\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora grumbled, but still got up obediently and followed Jang Maldong.", "\u201cSo, what is it?\u201d", "\u201cDo me a favor.\u201d", "\u201cA favor? You? From me?\u201d", "\u201cListen up.\u201d", "Jang Maldong explained slowly, and Phi Sora couldn\u2019t hide her shock.", "\u201cW-What?\u201d", "\u201cDo you think you can do it?\u201d", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t\u2026 but why me?\u201d", "Phi Sora was about to protest when she saw Jang Maldong\u2019s heated gaze and shut her mouth.", "\u201c\u2026Argh, dammit! But I fought with that son of a bitch!\u201d", "Phi Sora scratched her head and scowled.", "*", "Seol Jihu got up from bed rather late the next morning.", "He couldn\u2019t sleep all night.", "What Jang Maldong said to him kept lingering on his mind.", "He couldn\u2019t help but have immature thoughts like \u2018but we won the war\u2019 or \u2018I worked harder than anyone else\u2019. But Seol Jihu eventually shook off these thoughts.", "Jang Maldong had taught him selflessly until now, and what he said wasn\u2019t really wrong either.", "Regardless, a day had already gone by, and he had to return to Earth by the end of it.", "\u201c\u2026Man!\u201d", "Sighing, Seol Jihu climbed up the stairs when he suddenly caught sight of a beautiful, red-haired woman coming down.", "Coincidentally, their eyes met.", "\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d", "The woman\u2019s eyes widened.", "A faint smile spread across Seol Jihu\u2019s face.", "Just looking at Phi Sora cheered him up a bit.", "He was feeling a little down, and now he had the perfect person to prank.", "Of course, Phi Sora reacted in a completely different way.

Where do you think you\u2019re touching? Get your hands off me this instant!\u201d", "\u201cEii, what are you sulking for? So petty.\u201d", "\u201cWhat was that?\u201d", "\u201cNow, now, have you had breakfast? You haven\u2019t, right? Let\u2019s go.\u201d", "He grabbed Phi Sora\u2019s hand and pulled her up the stairs.", "Phi Sora went with him, pretending to give in. Seol Jihu had come to her just when she was wondering how she should strike up a conversation with him.", "They arrived on the tenth floor.", "Because it was time for breakfast, several people were already sitting together, chatting away noisily.", "Seol Jihu brought Phi Sora to a seat, then went straight to the kitchen.", "Shortly afterward, he walked out with a plate.", "A bowl of steaming ramen was placed on the table.", "Seol Jihu then placed a small plate of kimchi and a bowl of white rice, finishing the Seol Jihu Ramen Special.", "Phi Sora was taken aback.", "\u201cOh right, you advanced to Level 6, right?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d", "\u201cCongratulations.

Go ahead.\u201d", "With a silly smile, Seol Jihu pushed the bowl of ramen toward her.", "Phi Sora looked noticeably uncomfortable, but her body was honest.", "Gulp. With the sound of swallowing saliva, she gave in to the temptation and picked up the chopsticks.", "\u201cDammit, do you add drugs to the ramen or something? Why is it so damn good?\u201d", "She grumbled as she picked up a waterfall of ramen with her chopsticks.", "Slurp, slurrrp.", "Seol Jihu smiled beamingly as he saw Phi Sora eat with a tasty sound.", "Finding this gaze uncomfortable, Phi Sora glanced up and looked at Seol Jihu.", "\u201cI\u2019m gonna say this in advance.\u201d", "She spoke indifferently with her cheeks stuffed with ramen.", "\u201cDon\u2019t think this is all it takes to calm my anger.\u201d", "\u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t want to eat my ramen from now?\u201d", "\u201cAgh, fuck, that\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m saying you should show some sincerity after angering someone so much.\u201d", "Phi Sora corrected Seol Jihu as if the prospect of never eating his ramen again terrified her.", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cSincerity?\u201d", "\u201cYes, sincerity. For example\u2026\u201d", "Phi Sora gave a sidelong glance.", "\u201cYou and I met on Earth once before, right?\u201d", "\u201cYes, at the pork belly place.\u201d", "\u201cGreat. Then go on a little picnic with me.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Come again?\u201d", "\u201cAren\u2019t you going to Earth anyway? You should tag along with me on a trip while you\u2019re at it.

That old man did? Really? Then this is going to be the first time I\u2019m seeing him on Earth.\u201d", "Before anyone noticed, more and more people began to gather around Seol Jihu.", "Seol Jihu stared in a daze as they chatted in excitement.", "\u201cSeol, Seol, you\u2019re going too, right?

This is a group bonding activity! You should be there as Valhalla\u2019s representative!\u201d", "\u201cGroup bonding activity, huh. I just don\u2019t know if we need to meet on Earth. We can\u2019t even speak the same language there.\u201d", "\u201cWho cares? It works out once you meet. I\u2019ve met Dylan and Chohong before, and that\u2019s what happened.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, going on a vacation together. Everyone\u2019s going back to Earth anyway.

Miss Kim really knows what she\u2019s talking about!\u201d", "\u201cHawaii has a hospital specialized for Earthlings, so I can make preparations right away. I know an acquaintance there.

Do you really need to?\u201d", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like we need to\u2026\u201d", "Chohong shrugged.", "\u201cBut what\u2019s there to not get? Isn\u2019t it just part of having fun?\u201d", "\u201cHaving fun?\u201d", "\u201cYeah. What\u2019s better than having fun to forget bad memories?\u201d", "\u2018Bad memories?\u2019", "Seol Jihu frowned. His gaze seemed to be asking for an explanation.", "\u201cThink about it. We just had a huge war. How many times did we almost die? Can you forget all about it?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "The answer was no.", "War wasn\u2019t an everyday thing, and with how impactful it was, Seol Jihu would never be able to forget it.", "Perhaps until he breathed his last breath.", "\u201cBut we won.\u201d", "\u201cWinning aside\u2026 Never mind. What\u2019s important is that Paradise left us with unforgettable memories, whether good or bad.\u201d", "Chohong continued.", "\u201cSo we need to make them fuzzy before they really take root in our heads. With Earth\u2019s memories, of course. Replacing them with other memories of Paradise would be no good.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cAnd actually, you might need this more than anyone else. Of course, you don\u2019t need to go on a trip. People have different ways of preparing for death in Paradise\u2026 So, is there anything you do in particular?\u201d", "Seol Jihu closed his mouth. He suddenly remembered how Phi Sora worked part-time to look back on her life on Earth.", "But what about him?", "\u201cIf you don\u2019t, just come with us on this beach trip. It\u2019ll be fun to see each other on Earth for once. We can curse each other out all we want since we won\u2019t be able to understand each other anyway.\u201d", "\u201cRight, right! It\u2019s more fun than you think! So? You\u2019re going, right, Seol?\u201d", "Hugo interfered tactlessly.", "Seol Jihu licked his lips until letting loose a deep sigh of frustration.", "He understood what they were saying, but he couldn\u2019t empathize with it at all.", "In fact, doubts emerged within him.", "\u201c\u2026You guys must not like life in Paradise that much, huh.\u201d", "A quiet murmur flowed out.", "Chohong furrowed her brows, and the smile on the excited Hugo\u2019s face faded away.", "\u201cHey, that\u2019s not what we mean.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, yeah, I get what you mean. Yes, a beach trip sounds nice. People who want to go should. Preparing for the worst-case scenario is good too. I acknowledge that.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took a roundabout way to say they should not force someone into going if they didn\u2019t want to go.", "\u201cSounds good? Then let\u2019s go with that. Oh right, I haven\u2019t told you guys about the fruit and the divinity, right?\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head and changed the subject in a bright voice.", "\u201cListen up. It\u2019s hard to say anything about the divinity, but the fruit is amazing. This thing\u2019s effect is\u2026\u201d", "However, he had to stop as everyone was staring at him fixedly.

As for the rest, send us a mail, alright?\u201d", "Phi Sora waved her hand in front of the warp gate.", "\u201cOu! See you guys in Hawaii!\u201d", "Hugo shouted excitedly.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say much.
