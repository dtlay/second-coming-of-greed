Yun Seohui", "content": ["\u201cNot bad.\u201d", "Yun Seohui\u2019s eyes curved into crescent moons as she smiled.", "Phi Sora flinched, as did others.", "The reason they were in this mess, the reason Roe Scheherazade chose to betray humanity, was Sinyoung.", "Of course, the order might not have come directly from Yun Seohui, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that her attitude as Sinyoung\u2019s representative was inappropriate.", "They certainly didn\u2019t expect her to break down in remorse, but it puzzled them that she showed no signs of regret.", "Yun Seohui seemed rather amused.", "\u201cIt did surprise me that they captured Nur and came to Scheherazade at full speed\u2026. But when I really think about it, I have nothing to lose in this situation.\u201d", "With a smirk, Yun Seohui spread her arms wide.", "\u201cYou know what they say. Opportunities are found in times of crisis. The Parasites\u2019 invasion basically proved my innocence, and I can use that to my advantage\u2026. And as for Sinyoung, I was scheduled to resign anyway.\u201d", "She tilted her head and shrugged her shoulders.", "\u201cI hate that I had to go down without a fight. And then this happens, and I feel much better. Or should I say, refreshing?\u201d", "Everyone stood frozen in shock.", "Only Seol Jihu calmly stared at Yun Seohui twirling her hair with a finger.", "After a moment of silence, he cleared his throat and asked the same question he asked earlier.", "\u201cRoe Scheherazade? As I said, I knew about her. But I couldn\u2019t lay a finger on her because of my father. What a retard. Couldn\u2019t hide his disgusting stench in Paradise\u2026. It\u2019s all his fault.\u201d", "\u201cNope, I had no intention of stopping her. It had nothing to do with me. Though I didn\u2019t know this would happen.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I knew he was planning something, but didn\u2019t think he\u2019d go so far as to join hands with the Parasites. He tricked me. That Jung Minjong, he\u2019s a son of a bitch.\u201d", "\u201cOh, the texts? I was just curious. That\u2019s all.\u201d", "Yun Seohui answered without hesitation due to the influence of mental magic.", "And then\u2026.", "\u201cAh, about your sister?\u201d", "Her voice suddenly rose.", "\u201cAs I said, I only told him to take responsibility.\u201d", "She held up her hands and remarked primly.", "But the bitterness was soon wiped from her face.", "\u201cHowever~\u201d", "The corners of her mouth curled up into a horrifying smile.", "Then she continued.", "\u201cYou and I both know that words can be interpreted in many different ways.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyebrows twitched.", "The possibility had crossed his mind before, but\u2026.", "\u201cYou, Representative Seol, are such an idiot. Did you really think a contract would solve all your problems? A Priest\u2019s vow? Do you think that\u2019s impossible to get around?\u201d", "\u201cDumbass. When all Earthlings return to Earth for the first time, they\u2019re required to sign a contract saying that they won\u2019t mention Paradise. Does that mean we can\u2019t talk about Paradise on Earth? Of course not. We can and we do. We refer to it using words like \u2018that place\u2019 or \u2018Eden\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cAnd I took advantage of that loophole. Director Jung Minjong has been working with me for many years. He understood what I meant when I told him to take responsibility. He gets me.\u201d", "\u201cI told him I was in the same position as he was. He knows how I operate, so I bet he thought I'd create an opportunity for him to get back on his feet.\u201d", "Seol Jihu closed his eyes.", "\u201c\u2026So you\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d", "He took a deep breath and continued.", "\u201cYou\u2019re the one who ordered him to threaten my family.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said? I only told him to take responsibility!\u201d", "Yun Seohui pushed up her upper lip with her lower lip.", "\u201cI never lied.\u201d", "She opened her eyes wide and smirked.", "The mocking expression on her face most certainly called for a punch.", "After a brief pause, Seol Jihu slowly opened his eyes.", "\u201cYou\u2019re the one who murdered Jung Minjong.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, I killed him.\u201d", "Yun Seohui grinned.", "\u201cI was going to kill him whether he succeeded or not. A way out? There\u2019s no way I had something like that when you were driving me into a corner.\u201d", "\u201cI signed a contract and made a vow. By that time I had reached the point of no return, so I used him as a tool to prove my innocence.\u201d", "\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve been carrying blank contracts everywhere I go. Because I didn\u2019t know when you\u2019d show up!\u201d", "Even as she revealed her true feelings, her face didn\u2019t show the slightest hint of guilt.", "Phi Sora\u2019s jaw dropped.", "Chohong chuckled and Oh Rahee shook her head.", "\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201d", "Even Maria seemed aghast and bewildered.", "\u201cHoly fuck\u2026. Whoa\u2026. Seriously, whoa\u2026.\u201d", "Her face clearly displayed the shock of discovering a bitch beyond belief.", "Some of the more impatient members grabbed their weapons, but their feet stayed planted.", "\u201c\u2026Why\u2026.\u201d", "Because even though he appeared calm\u2026.", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "Seol Jihu was angrier than anyone else here.", "\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "Yun Seohui snorted.", "\u201cThat\u2019s an easy question to answer. There was something I wanted to see.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cI really, really~ wanted to see your face in despair. I wanted to see you kneel down in regret.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s face hardened.", "\u201cJust think about it. During the Arden Valley War, I gathered the executors and sent reinforcements for you. When you founded an organization in Eva, I visited to congratulate you. On Earth, I protected you and your family.\u201d", "\u201cAh, the actual person who looked after you and your family is Seora\u2026. But I approved it, so I can take the credit for it, right?\u201d", "\u201cAnyway, my point is that I\u2019ve done so much for you, but you still forced me to sign the contract and resign. It\u2019s bullshit. Ugh, just thinking about it makes me angry again.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m Sinyoung\u2019s representative. I am. But you crossed the line. You\u2019re not supposed to do this to me. How could you do this to me?\u201d", "\u2018Now it\u2019s my turn to ask.\u2019 She announced and threw a question.", "\u201cI was nice to you, so why weren\u2019t you nice to me?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI did nothing to harm you, so why? Hmm?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWhy are you so quiet? Answer me\u2026. Answer me, you son of a bitch!\u201d", "Seol Jihu raised his chin and looked up at the sky.", "A sigh escaped his clenched lips.", "Yun Seohui pouted.", "\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s the reason. Now I\u2019m going to do the same thing to you as you did to me.\u201d", "This must be why she answered \u2018not bad\u2019 when asked how she felt. Because whether it was intentional or not, she did get to see Seol Jihu\u2019s face in despair.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d", "Yun Seohui lifted her chin and announced in an almost arrogant tone.", "[There\u2019s one case I believe Yun Seohui could be the culprit, but for my assumption to be true, she has to have the mind of a 5-year-old\u2026.]", "Suddenly, the conversation he had with Eun Yuri the other day crossed his mind.", "Eun Yuri was right. The status window didn\u2019t lie.", "Capricious, manchild, selfish, contrived, artificial doll\u2026 Yun Seohui was an adult and a human only on the outside. Inside, she was still an immature child.", "\u201cWhat are your plans from here on?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked, swallowing his breath.", "\u201cMe? Let\u2019s see\u2026. Sinyoung is basically done for, so I\u2019ll leave the mess to Seora and join Valhalla.\u201d", "\u201cHow?\u201d", "\u201cNow that my innocence has been proven, I\u2019ll beg Valhalla for forgiveness, tell them that I was never cut out to be the representative of an organization, and that I\u2019ll do anything they ask me to do, even the shitty tasks. Then maybe they\u2019ll take pity on me and accept me.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026If we accept you, will you work hard?\u201d", "\u201cW-What? Hey! You can\u2019t possibly\u2026?\u201d", "Chohong, who had already tightened and loosened her grip around the Thorn of Steel more than a dozen times, jumped in a startle.", "She was about to ask Seol Jihu if he was out of his mind, then stopped.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s fist was clenched tightly around the shaft, slowly lifting the spear.", "\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll work hard!\u201d", "But this didn\u2019t seem to alarm Yun Seohui at all and she shouted merrily.", "\u201cI\u2019ll work hard to win your trust for the time being\u2026. And then~\u201d", "\u201cAnd then?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll stab you in the back at the most crucial moment!\u201d", "Yun Seohui waved her right arm in a circle as if swinging a hammer.", "\u201cSo you can screw me over?\u201d", "\u201cYup, yup. I\u2019ve seen your face warped with despair, but I haven\u2019t seen you kneel in regret yet. It\u2019ll be hard, but I\u2019ll come up with a plan. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make you regret what you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll make you say, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have treated Yun Seohui like that~\u2019\u201d", "\u2018Of course, if you're nice to me, I might change my mind.\u2019 Yun Seohui shrugged with a smirk.", "\u201cAnd if we don\u2019t accept you?\u201d", "Seol Jihu asked in a calm voice, even though he heard his comrades shouting at him to kill her already.", "\u201cIf you don\u2019t accept me? Let\u2019s see\u2026. If you refuse to take me with you\u2026.\u201d", "Yun Seohui propped her chin on her finger, and then smirked and tilted her head.", "\u201cWell then, I guess I have no choice but to return to Scheherazade.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re crossing the line.\u201d", "\u201cRoe Scheherazade\u2019s presence bothers me\u2026 but wouldn\u2019t she accept me if I showed her how sorry I am?\u201d", "Seol Jihu remained silent.", "Because he had already seen what would happen.", "Only this time, Roe Scheherazade replaced Kim Hannah.", "Suddenly, Yun Seohui clenched her stomach and giggled quietly.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s expression became bleak.", "\u201c\u2026What\u2019s so funny?\u201d", "\u201cAh, come to think of it, it\u2019s funny.\u201d", "Yun Seohui nodded, wiping her tears.", "\u201cFunny, because this could\u2019ve been prevented. If I hadn\u2019t told Jung Minjong to mess with your family\u2026 you\u2019d have more time on your hands\u2026.\u201d", "That was the last straw.", "\u201cOr at least\u2026 if I hadn\u2019t played hard to get and picked up your call just a little sooner\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu took a step forward with the Spear of Purity in his hand.", "\u201cIn a way\u2026.\u201d", "The light slowly returned to Yun Seohui\u2019s dull eyes.", "\u201cMy actions have\u2026 ruined your plan\u2026?\u201d", "\u2018Huh?\u2019 Yun Seohui blinked rapidly as if she had suddenly awakened from a dream.", "The effect of Roselle\u2019s mental magic had come to an end.", "\u201cHuh? Huh\u2026.\u201d", "Yun Seohui was evidently perplexed.", "She couldn\u2019t tell whether she was dreaming or not.", "But the memory of what had just happened was clear in her head.", "Going over everything she\u2019d said out loud\u2026.", "\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d", "Yun Seohui turned pale with fright.", "Upon realization, she hurriedly raised her head.", "Seol Jihu was approaching her slowly, step by step, holding the snow-white spear diagonally in his hand.", "There was not a trace of anger or rage on his face.", "Rather, his expression was devoid of all emotions.", "This frightened her all the more as the blank expression seemed to indicate that he had finally given up all hope for her.", "And she was right. Seol Jihu no longer wanted to hear what she had to say.", "\u201cD-Don\u2019t co\u2026. W-Wait\u2026.\u201d", "Yun Seohui\u2019s face was a sight to see.", "She looked like she didn\u2019t expect this to happen like she knew she was fucked.", "\u201cD-Don\u2019t come any closer!\u201d", "Yun Seohui backed away from him, shaking her head left and right and shouting at the top of her lungs.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be mad. I lied\u2026 I mean\u2026 Seora! That\u2019s right, it\u2019s all Seora\u2019s fault!\u201d", "Seol Jihu snorted.", "\u201cL-Listen. Aren\u2019t you curious? Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m innocent, but I\u2026!\u201d", "Babbling nonsense, Yun Seohui suddenly tripped and fell on her butt.", "Her mouth slowly opened as she looked up at Seol Jihu approaching her.", "At the same time, a look of defiance quickly brushed her face, and her hands moved with great agility.", "A light flickered past Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes.", "\u201cS-Stop! Please!\u201d", "Could it be that she had expected this from the beginning?", "On the surface, Yun Seohui appeared completely frightened, but even in this situation, she was secretly moving her hands toward her pockets.", "Her tenacity was simply astounding. She was thorough beyond belief.", "Seol Jihu strengthened his grip.", "The truth was that he had meant to kill her ever since she said she never lied.", "Black Seol Jihu might have kept her alive because he needed all the hands he could get, but Seol Jihu had no intention of letting her escape.", "So he made up his mind and pulled the spear behind his shoulders.", "\u201cI said\u2026!\u201d", "Yun Seohui shouted desperately before her lips curled into a small grin.", "\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d", "She took her hands out of her pockets at the same time that someone, growling like a beast, rushed at her brandishing a long sword.", "Rip!", "\u201cCome\u2026?\u201d", "Yun Seohui\u2019s eyes widened.", "The left side of her body felt numb.", "She unconsciously turned her head and saw her left arm, separated from her body, flying in the air. Her hand was clutching a blue stone.", "Yun Seohui\u2019s eyes shot open even wider than before.", "But even as that happened she quickly brought her right hand holding a piece of paper to her mouth. She bit the paper and tore it.", "No\u2014 she tried to tear it.", "Rip!", "The long sword once again slashed down at her.", "This time, her right arm separated from her shoulder and fell to the ground.", "Yun Seohui tried to get up but fell to her knees.", "At the same time, she tilted her head back.", "\u201cKIAAAAAAA!\u201d", "A sharp shriek broke out as blood spurted like a fountain from where the arms had been cut off.", "Slap! Yun Seohui\u2019s face turned to the side.", "Her cheek ached and burned.", "She had just been slapped with the blade of a sword, and blood was beginning to drip from the cut on her cheek.", "\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d", "Slap! Before she could say anything, her face turned again under the force of the blow.", "Her eyes moved instinctively in the midst of confusion.", "The attack hadn\u2019t come from a Valhalla member.", "Marcel Ghionea and Kazuki were pointing their arrows at her, but they hadn\u2019t fired yet.", "And it wasn\u2019t Seol Jihu either. He was frozen in place with his spear above his head, looking slightly surprised.", "Which meant\u2026.", "\u201c!\u201d", "Yun Seohui finally managed to hold her head up straight. When she saw the figure in front of her, she became dazed.", "Because the woman standing before her, with her sword raised to the sky and her bloodshot eyes filled with rage, was\u2026.", "\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "\u2026None other than her sister, Yun Seora."]}
