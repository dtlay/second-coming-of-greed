That was what Jung Sua said.", "So when she faced Eva\u2019s bare face, Charlotte Aria became lost for words. She could not even breathe from utter shock at the visible horrors.", "The streets were dirty and reeked with a foul stench. The residents sitting helplessly on the streets were considered the noblemen. There were boney children rummaging through trash cans and short corpses mixed with filth abandoned in alleyways.", "Charlotte Aria\u2019s pupils shook violently as she witnessed this scenery.", "Even a king could not take care of all the poor. Valhalla was spending large amounts of money every day to support the masses, but it was impossible to save all of Eva.", "This was after the corrupt Eva Alliance disappeared and the streets had gotten better with Valhalla\u2019s help.", "\u201cUuuk!\u201d", "Charlotte Aria threw up unknowingly.

Although these features made her look like a child, her body made it clear that she was an adult.", "Moreover, seeing her blue, tranquil, ocean-like eyes, Seol Jihu felt a natural reverence toward her.", "In truth, he had felt it from the time Kim Hannah dragged her over. Although the queen tried her best to disguise herself, her appearance and the air around her could not be hidden with shoddy disguises.", "Perhaps because she was a royal, dignity exuded from each of her steps and gestures.", "\u201cAre you Valhalla\u2019s representative?\u201d", "Charlotte Aria asked abruptly.", "\u201cYes, I am.\u201d", "Seol Jihu smiled brightly.", "\u201cYou knew?\u201d", "\u201cHow could I not?\u201d", "She sounded somewhat curt.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing about you from various places.\u201d", "\u201cOh?\u201d", "\u201cWith what intention are you doing all this?\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked in a daze.
