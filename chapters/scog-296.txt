An Unexpected Clue (3)", "content": ["Startled by Seol Jihu\u2019s unexpected movement, Eun Yuri hurriedly attempted to twist her arms.", "However, being completely drained of energy from the intense training, her fatigued body did not move as she wished, causing her to be caught in Seol Jihu\u2019s hands.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s lips curled up into a mischievous grin.", "\"Jeez, why are you resisting so much\u2026 It\u2019s a gift, you know?\u201d", "Eun Yuri glared at the chuckling Seol Jihu, but she could only dumbfoundedly stare as a ring was slipped onto her finger.", "\"It\u2019s all done now. Congratulations.\u201d", "Seol Jihu patted the back of Eun Yuri\u2019s hand.", "She had a rare, perplexed expression as she stared at the silver ring on her finger.", "Sure, giving a ring as a present was fine and all, but her face said she could not, for the love of god, understand why it had to be her left hand, and why he had to personally put the ring on the ring finger of her left hand.", "\"You worked hard. Get some rest now.\"", "Eun Yuri glared at Seol Jihu with narrowed eyes, but Seol Jihu paid no heed to it. Instead, he even winked at her.", "\"Oh right, don\u2019t be too surprised. There might be another person there, but she\u2019s a queen, so don\u2019t be too disrespectful.\u201d", "Leaving behind words she didn\u2019t understand, Seol Jihu walked out, waving his hand.", "\"\u2026\"", "Eun Yuri stared at her left ring finger for a long time before shaking her head. She then let out a long sigh before quietly closing her eyes.", "And when she opened her eyes again, a new world was spread out in front of her.", "\"Welcome!\"", "\"Come here! Hurry up and come!\u201d", "With two girls wearing pointed hats welcoming her with outstretched arms.", "*", "The next day.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s predictions were spot on. Eun Yuri paid him a visit as soon as morning arrived.", "She didn\u2019t make a fuss as Charlotte Aria did, but he could guess what she was feeling from her glowing face. The emotions of joy and excitement which she hadn\u2019t shown during the Tutorial were exuding from her.", "\"How was it?\u201d", "\"It was incredible.\"", "As if the surprise of experiencing a new world hadn\u2019t faded yet, Eun Yuri replied with rushed breathing.", "\"Something like that\u2014 It was the first time I experienced anything like it.\u201d", "\"Well, it\u2019s definitely not something you can experience easily.\u201d", "\"It still feels like a dream. Can you imagine? Borrowing the power of the universe\u2019s source to make the human spirit flow into an arbitrary closed system isolated from the middle world with no external force acting upon it in the form of a dream, causing the direction of entropy to\u2026.\u201d", "\u2026She excitedly rattled on incomprehensible sentences.", "No. As an engineering student, he was able to understand a portion of what she was saying, but Seol Jihu could not understand why the Second Law of Thermodynamics was suddenly mentioned.", "He covered her restlessly blabbering mouth with his hand before asking another question.", "\"Did you meet Lady Roselle?\"", "Eun Yuri mmphed.", "\"Ah, sorry.\u201d", "\"Yes, and I also made a friend.\u201d", "\"A friend? Ah~ That\u2019s great. To be already friends with a queen. You must feel good.\u201d", "\"Of course. But above all, to finally have a teacher\u2026.\u201d", "'She must really like them.\u2019", "Seol Jihu gave a satisfied laugh inside as he saw Eun Yuri talking more than usual. Was this how Cao Cao felt as he looked at the overjoyed Guan Yu when he received the Red Hare?", "\"I told you that I would help you properly.\u201d", "Seol Jihu brightly smiled.", "\"Work hard. Our promise is important, but it\u2019s not like we won\u2019t see each other after the Neutral Zone. You\u2019ll stick with us from now on out, won\u2019t you?\u201d", "Eun Yuri suddenly fell silent at those words. She then carefully asked him.", "\"\u2026Can I?\"", "Seol Jihu blinked his eyes. Eun Yuri asked him a second time.", "\"Can I really follow you after we get out of the Neutral Zone?\u201d", "\"Of course.\u201d", "Seol Jihu remarked awkwardly.", "\"Why? Were you planning to go somewhere else when the Neutral Zone closes?\u201d", "\"No! Definitely not!\u201d", "Eun Yuri vehemently denied it.", "\"That\u2019s a relief.\u201d", "\"I\u2019m not lying. No one\u2019s tampered with me!\u201d", "\"Well, it\u2019s fine even if it happened.\u201d", "Seol Jihu grinned when he saw Eun Yuri protesting while feeling wronged.", "\"I\u2019m not one to just look when someone takes what\u2019s mine. I\u2019m more of the type to do the taking.\u201d", "\"\u2026.\"", "\"In any case, don\u2019t worry about anything and just follow me.\u201d", "As he said that, Eun Yuri rapidly shifted her eyes, not knowing where to look before replying in a small voice.", "\"\u2026Yes!\"", "He didn\u2019t understand why she was smiling shyly. Seol Jihu grew curious about why she suddenly was acting like that, but he still continued his words.", "\"In any case, let\u2019s go with this routine for a month. Physical training in the Neutral Zone and magic training in your sleep. It\u2019s a rigorous schedule, but it shouldn\u2019t be too impossible with the first ranker\u2019s room.\u201d", "\"Of course. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d", "Eun Yuri clasped her hands and gave a faint smile.", "\"You\u2019ve already set everything up for me. I\u2019ll work really hard and become someone useful to you.\u201d", "They were truly commendable words, so Seol Jihu felt pleased inside and cheered her on.", "\"Alright. Do your best for today\u2019s training.\u201d", "\"Yes!\"", "Eun Yuri loudly shouted before turning around. She walked out with joyful steps before abruptly pausing.", "Turning only her head around, she said.", "\"Thank you, Oppa.\u201d", "Seol Jihu blinked his eyes.", "Just now\u2026 what did she say?", "\"You\u2019re almost like a god, Oppa.\u201d", "\"\u2026A god?\"", "\"Yes. A god.\"", "Eun Yuri\u2019s eyes curved prettily like crescent moons.", "\"Because you grant my wishes.\u201d", "With that, she ran out as if she was escaping.", "Seol Jihu, who was now alone, scratched his head. He couldn\u2019t figure out why she acted like that nor did he understand the meaning behind her last sentence.", "*", "Time flew by in a breeze, and a month passed.", "The day the Awakening Chamber opened finally came.", "To Earthlings, their class would determine their value. Perhaps it was because of this that the people lined up under the supervision of the instructors all had nervous faces.", "Seol Jihu leaned against the stairway, carefully observing the people coming out of the Awakening Chamber, one by one.", "The majority did not take more than one or two minutes.", "Looking with his General Observation, most were Warriors like he had expected, with a few Archers here and there.", "There wasn\u2019t a single person that had awakened as a Magician or a Priest despite the large number of people.", "'Yoo Yeolmu is a Warrior and Park Woori is an Archer\u2026\u2019", "Then, at long last, Eun Yuri entered the Awakening Chamber. Seol Jihu intently stared at the pure white door. Though he didn\u2019t feel completely relaxed, he thought from experience that it was highly likely for Eun Yuri to take a long time inside.", "However, the door swung open in less than two minutes of Eun Yuri going in.", "\"Haak\u2014\"", "He heard her heavy panting. Eun Yuri staggered out of the door with her hair drenched in sweat.", "'Already?'", "The moment he activated his Nine Eyes, Seol Jihu\u2019s pupils dilated.", "'Violet.'", "Eun Yuri\u2019s body was bathed in a clear violet color \u2014 Stellar Evolution.", "'But she was green during the Tutorial\u2026\u2019", "The color had changed into violet in the span of one month. Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "'Is this the second\u2026 no, the third time?\u2019", "However, before he could even finish the thought\u2014Pat! A vision unfolded before his eyes.", "Seol Jihu focused his gaze on the scene. He saw an unfamiliar woman in the center of the vision. Seol Jihu needed a few moments to realize that this woman was actually Eun Yuri.", "Her face and the air about her looked more mature, and her outfit was completely different. Most importantly, she had an extremely angered expression.", "[This is something that absolutely must be done.]", "She must be talking to someone judging by how she was glaring and shouting in a certain direction.", "[The moment the Spirit Realm falls, Tigol Fortress is done for. And if Tigol Fortress falls, it\u2019s the end for the Federation. And if the Federation falls\u2026]", "[Humanity perishes.]", "A husky voice finished her sentence. Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t see the owner of the voice in the vision, but he definitely heard it. Seol Jihu subconsciously touched his neck with his hand.", "[I get what you\u2019re saying, but\u2026]", "The unidentified voice continued in a low voice.", "[What of it? What do you expect me to do?]", "In the vision, Eun Yuri\u2019s face twisted in anger.", "[Aren\u2019t you in a cooperative partnership with the Federation?]", "[Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s closer to a deal than cooperation. Well, they did treat me better than humanity.]", "[What are you saying? Does it matter if it\u2019s a deal or cooperation in this situation?]", "[Enough.]", "The individual who was presumed to be a male cut off Eun Yuri\u2019s words.", "[Alright. Well fine. Assuming everything you say is out of good intentions, what I want to know is why you\u2019re saying this to me. What about the force of Earthlings that you humanity were so proud of?]", "[\u2026I don\u2019t think the Parasite Queen will stay still.]", "Eun Yuri continued speaking.", "[It\u2019s obvious that at least two or three Commanders will be mobilized. That\u2019s why we need your help in saving the Spirit Realm. There\u2019s no one who knows the Commanders better than you.]", "[Aha. So you chase me out when you don\u2019t need me and beg for help when you need me.]", "Eun Yuri shut her mouth at his sarcastic remark.", "[Amazing, really! This doesn\u2019t apply to you, but sometimes, the fact that I\u2019m from the same race as the rest of humanity makes me want to puke.]", "Eun Yuri could only part her innocent lips, wondering if the man was arguing with her on purpose.", "[That\u2019s not all. It\u2019s been ages since the World Tree withered away. What difference does it make in saving the Spirit Realm now? Rather, do you even have a way to cross over to the Spirit Realm in the first place?]", "[You should know that there is another way to get to the Spirit Realm apart from going through the World Tree.]", "[Are you mad? If you\u2019re talking about the spring, don\u2019t even mention it. Are you running your mouth off because you don\u2019t know the military strength needed to ward off a single Commander?]", "[I know that the method of using the spring is limited. But if we unite with the remaining forces of the Spirit Realm, we might just be able to\u2026]", "Eun Yuri trailed off as if she herself thought that their chance of success was remote. A snort was heard.", "[Jesus. I agreed to meet you because of your fame, but it turns out you\u2019re a hopeless fool like the rest of them. Did you ask to meet me only because of a meaningless sense of duty to do something?]", "[.\u2026]", "[What a waste of time! Fuck off! No, I\u2019ll fuck off instead.]", "The man\u2019s footsteps gradually grew fainter following the sound of him clicking his tongue. Eun Yuri bit her lower lip before shouting.", "[Let\u2019s make a deal.]", "[?]", "[I said let\u2019s make a deal. With me.]", "[\u2026What? Do you even know what I want?]", "[The thing you want. No, the thing you hope to accomplish. I know what it is.]", "Eun Yuri gulped before saying with a resolute face.", "[I have a method to save the Sacred Empress. This method is much more reliable than the method you, Spear Demon, plan on using.]", "In the next moment, Eun Yuri\u2019s eyes widened in the vision. Seol Jihu, who was watching the vision, also shot his eyes open. It was because a spear\u2019s blade was held against her neck before he even blinked once.", "[Speak.]", "And in the vision\u2026 he saw a familiar back. As Eun Yuri said, it was his past-future-self.", "[I sincerely hope that it isn\u2019t some nonsense. I really don\u2019t want to kill the Magician who\u2019s touted as one of humanity\u2019s last hope with my own hands.]", "And Eun Yuri\u2026", "\"Oppa?\"", "\u2026suddenly walked out of the screen. At the same time, the vision disappeared like it never existed.", "\"You\u2019re so mean. I asked you to help me\u2026\u201d", "A softly grumbling Eun Yuri was taking deep breaths while wiping her forehead that was drenched in sweat.", "Seol Jihu looked down at the panting Eun Yuri with dazed eyes.", "It wasn\u2019t once or twice that he had seen visions, but his head felt complicated after receiving so much information.", "However, Seol Jihu was sure about one thing: his prediction was correct.", "Humanity\u2019s last hope. In the alternate future, Eun Yuri had been one of humanity\u2019s important figures who fought against the Parasites to the very end.", "Her status window came into his sight at last.", "[Eun Yuri\u2019s Status Window]", "[1.

The first is sorcery, an art that borrows power from supernatural beings or mysterious powers to replace formulas with spells to control the flow of mana. The second is magic, an art that materializes mana through fixed laws according to a standardized system.
