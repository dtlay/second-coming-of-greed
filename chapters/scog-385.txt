The insects were annoying.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t they sound just like crickets? They sound like something boiling\u2014\u201d", "An elderly voice was heard from the direction of the window\u2026", "\u201cHow long do I have to wait?\u201d", "\u2026While a different voice was heard from the center of the room.", "It was a low voice that was neither aged nor young.", "\u201cThat same question again. Why are you in such a hurry?\u201d", "The voice accompanied by low laughter moved from the window towards the center of the room.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no helping it. At this rate, the Parasites will treat humanity as its main enemy. No, they might already think so.\u201d", "\u201cI suppose. The outcome of the battle at Tigol Fortress was surprising, both for us and for the Parasites\u2026 But isn\u2019t it fine? Since they\u2019ve won the war\u2014\u201d", "\u201cFine? Enough with the jokes.\u201d", "The dignified voice sharpened.", "\u201cDo you think that the Parasites will perish just because of one or two defeats? No, absolutely not. The Parasites' forces are immortal. All they have to do is remake however much they lost each time.\u201d", "The slightly angry voice continued.", "\u201cThat\u2019s not all. The revival of the World Tree? An alliance with the Federation? All is vain in the face of absolute power. Half of the Federation\u2019s core army was annihilated when the Parasite Queen unleashed her aura just once.\u201d", "\u201cHmm. It\u2019s hard to believe, but I\u2019ve heard that as well.\u201d", "\u201cIf that\u2019s what she is capable of when she hasn't completely descended, then when she recovers her full powers\u2026\u201d", "The fiery voice began to soften.", "\u201c\u2026Ever since that bastard from the Sung family switched sides, the possibility of her recovering her divinity has risen.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, the voice continued calmly.", "\u201cWhen that day comes, humanity is done for. They won\u2019t even be able to hold out as the Federation did.\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2026 That\u2019s true.\u201d", "The man who had been listening quietly gave a chuckle.", "\u201cIf everything happens the way you think, then our current situation could certainly be described as a crisis.\u201d", "He then continued.", "\u201c\u2026Only if everything goes as you say, that is.\u201d", "\u201cYou make it sound like that won\u2019t be the case.\u201d", "\u201cNo, no, you misunderstand me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being vigilant. Only, isn\u2019t it better to focus on what\u2019s happening now than to worry about what hasn\u2019t happened yet?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cI agree that the Parasites won\u2019t leave humanity alone anymore. But that means they will now have to deal with two camps at once. That will certainly put a lot of pressure on them.\u201d", "\u201cDamn it! Don\u2019t you think I know that already?\u201d", "The frustrated voice exploded out.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re being too optimistic? Our victories up until now have been mere coincidences. Our goalkeeper miraculously managed to block the ball after our mindless defenders let every attacker slip past them.\u201d", "\u201cHuhu\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cFrom now on, humanity will be subject to many fierce attacks. Do you think we\u2019ll be able to block them all? I assure you, the answer is no. And if we let the Parasites cross the goal line even just once, we\u2019re done for.\u201d", "\u2018If you can\u2019t attack, you can\u2019t score.\u2019 Through this analogy, he pointed out that humanity was in no position to attack the Parasites.", "\u201cPlease calm down. I think you misunderstood me.\u201d", "The elderly voice was still calm, as opposed to his partner\u2019s.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that we should resist the Parasites. What I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026.\u201d", "The wrinkles around his mouth deepened in the dark.", "\u201cWe should put ourselves in their shoes for a moment. You\u2019re right. The Parasites will win if they can score just one goal, but they keep failing by a hair's breadth. Can you imagine how frustrated they must be?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s think this way. So there they are, all frustrated and restless when suddenly a player from the opposing team scores an own goal. How would they feel about that player?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cPerhaps we could use the current situation to our advantage. People never appreciate help when they\u2019re thriving. It\u2019s when they\u2019re in a crisis that they truly appreciate a gesture of help.\u201d", "\u201cYou say all the right things, but\u2026.\u201d", "There was a sneering sound.", "\u201cDo you not find yourself hypocritical? You say one thing and do another.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s an Asian proverb that says, \u2018first knock on the stone bridge before crossing it.\u2019\u201d", "The elderly voice remained calm regardless.", "\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite proverb. I believe people my age can easily relate to it as I myself have experienced it. In many cases I thought the bridge looked as sturdy as it could be, only to find out later that it was defective.\u201d", "\u201cHa. Have you ever heard of this saying? \u2018Time is gold.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cThe enemy isn\u2019t stupid.\u201d", "Suddenly the aged voice grew stern.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t looked into it. But the more I looked into it, the more confused I became. I know it\u2019s been almost a year, but that\u2019s not enough reason to move forward with our plan.\u201d", "\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t do anything until all of your questions have been answered?\u201d", "\u201cYes, and rightly so. Please recall that even the Parasite Queen couldn\u2019t stop him, a mere human. A coincidence? A miracle? Perhaps. Even so, I won\u2019t be able to rest until I know we have a countermeasure against this so-called miracle.\u201d", "Only then did he let out a small sigh.", "\u201c\u2026We only have one chance.\u201d", "After a moment of silence, the figure in the dark got up with a soft rustle.", "\u201cThere will be no second chances.
