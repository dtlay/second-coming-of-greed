The Star Sets in the Valley (2)", "content": ["Having crossed the Hiral Mountain Range, the Federation\u2019s troops were in the middle of a fierce battle.", "They were advancing while fighting wave after wave of the Parasite army, but the situation was not good. Not only was it difficult to fight within the Parasite Queen\u2019s territory, but it was also because the enemy troops were focused on delaying their march.", "Then, after a certain point, they began to rush forward as they normally did. According to a report delivered by the scouts, a large clump of the Parasite army deep inside their territory had just started to spread back out.", "\u201cWe\u2019re retreating.\u201d", "Realizing that they would end up besieged, Gabriel decided without a moment of hesitation.", "\u201cWe\u2019re retreating?\u201d", "A bespectacled, young man raised an objection.", "It was Philip Muller. He had run into the Federation\u2019s forces by pure chance and realized that something was off about the situation.", "As Eun Yuri was in a critical state, he requested Marcel Ghionea to take her back while he began to move with the Federation.", "\u201cNo way. It\u2019s only been a few days.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a few days.\u201d", "With a melancholic voice, Gabriel brushed aside Philip Muller\u2019s objection.", "\u201cIt was ever since you invaded the Empire\u2019s territory\u2026 To think the Parasite Queen would go this far\u2026.\u201d", "Quietly muttering to herself, she tilted her head back.", "\u201cThe star\u2026.\u201d", "After looking up at the sky for a while, she heaved out a deep sigh and lowered her head.", "\u201cIt\u2019s too late\u2026.\u201d", "With a mourning lamentation, she turned around.", "*", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you say we\u2019ll be safe once we cross this mountain?\u201d", "Crossing a rugged mountain, Phi Sora spoke as she wiped the sweat off her forehead.", "\u201cWe should be as we\u2019ll only be three or four days away from the border region.\u201d", "Hoshino Urara replied unenthusiastically.", "\u201cThe first week was decently fun, but we haven\u2019t run into any enemies for a while now!\u201d", "\u201cAre you complaining that you weren\u2019t able to use us as throwaways?\u201d", "Phi Sora shot back.", "\u201cJust ignore her.\u201d", "Chohong giggled as she followed them from the rear.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be angry about? Just be glad we\u2019re all alive.\u201d", "\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it out of there alive. We got lucky.\u201d", "Chohong spoke lightheartedly as if she couldn\u2019t believe they escaped from hell alive.", "\u201cLucky, huh\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora tilted her head doubtfully.", "\u201cWell, we might have gotten lucky\u2026 but I wonder if it was the same for the other groups\u2026\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s expression turned serious at Phi Sora\u2019s murmuring. She was so happy to have survived that she did not think of her comrades.", "\u201cDo you have a communication crystal?\u201d", "Hoshino Urara shrugged at Chohong\u2019s question.", "\u201cI have one.\u201d", "Phi Sora took out a transparent crystal orb from her pocket.", "\u201cWhere does it connect to?\u201d", "\u201cWhere do you think? Valhalla, obviously.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t see a blue light\u2026 We didn\u2019t get any calls?\u201d", "\u201cWho would call us? They don\u2019t know what situation we or any of the other parties might be in. Unless one of the escaping groups contact them first, they won\u2019t dare call us.\u201d", "A few Parasite species were sensitive to mana. If they were discovered by the enemy because of an untimely call, how tragic would that be?", "So even if the reserve forces found out about their situation, they wouldn\u2019t call the expedition team so recklessly.", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give it a try? As Urara said, we haven\u2019t run into any Parasites for a few days.\u201d", "\u201cI guess that\u2019s true\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora hesitated while fiddling with the communication crystal. Then, with a deep breath, she infused her mana into it.", "Woong!", "The communication crystal shone with bright light in less than a second.", "*", "Same time.", "The group consisting of Teresa and Yi Seol-Ah, led by Wu Lei, were about to escape the Empire.", "The three of them were in a similar spot.", "The tension was high for the first week. They ran into the Parasites\u2019 forces several times per day. At times, they ran into them once every two or three hours. Going back a day\u2019s worth of distance was normal, and there were even times when they had to remain in hiding for an entire day.", "If it weren\u2019t for Wu Lei\u2019s intuition-like instinct and Aura\u2019s danger-sensing ability, they would have been discovered at least once.", "After seven days, the frequency of the Parasites\u2019 appearances plummeted. A day or two after that, they were nowhere to be seen.", "It was also around this time that Teresa, who was resolved to die with a 99.9 percent chance, began to develop hope. Whether it was by heaven-defying luck or pure coincidence, they had crossed dozens of dangerous situations and were close to making it home.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll be at the Delphinion Duchy\u2019s border in a few days.\u201d", "Teresa spoke as she led the way.", "\u201cOnce we cross the border, we\u2019ll be able to breathe easy. Although we will still be in the Parasites\u2019 territory, it won\u2019t be under the control of the Parasite Queen.\u201d", "Though her voice was laden with profound exhaustion, her bright tone gave a glimpse into her hope of making it back alive.", "\u201cOnce we cross the border, we will be able to get away from this energy-draining phenomenon too\u2026. But don\u2019t let your guard down until then.\u201d", "A smile emerged on Yi Seol-Ah\u2019s deeply enervated face.", "\u201cRight, the Parasites are good at appearing out of the blue just when you think you\u2019re safe\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cI appreciate the warning, but\u2026\u201d", "At that moment, Wu Lei broke his silence.", "\u201cI think you jinxed us.\u201d", "Teresa and Yi Seol-Ah stopped walking simultaneously.", "\u201cShit! I knew I should have kept my mouth shut! Aura!\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah spat out a curse as if she was used to it by now. She then sent Aura flying up while looking around in a hurry.", "Though they had yet to estimate the size of the enemy force, it was probably better to hide than to fight in their current state.", "However, the information that Aura brought back shortly afterward was not what any of them expected.", "\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not the Parasites?\u201d", "It was news that the army marching in their direction was not the parasites but the humans.", "The three of them ran forward, half in doubt, and soon confirmed the truth. A large human army was crossing the Delphinion Duchy and advancing into the Empire.", "They too, seemed to have noticed the trio as the front line forces immediately turned in their direction. At the same time, a magic circle formed in front of them, and a figure appeared.", "\u201cYou were alive.\u201d", "The figure, Taciana Cinzia, spoke with a somewhat somber look.", "\u201cSo that confirms another party\u2019s safe return\u2026. I hope you understand. We can\u2019t contact the parties first since we don\u2019t know what situation they\u2019re in.\u201d", "Cinzia apologized in a low voice.", "However, neither Wu Lei, Teresa, nor Yi Seol-Ah was listening. Theyweren\u2019t thinking straight ever since they discovered the allied force.", "They had expected to endure for a few more days at the very least. Never in their wildest imagination did they think the rescue team would come and greet them.", "No, the army was too big to be considered a rescue team. It was understandable given that the expedition team had entered the heart of the Empire, but the army still seemed too big.", "\u201cMy god, did you come here to wage war?\u201d", "Teresa asked, having noticed a few suspicious points while making their escape.", "\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s just say we were committed. We were determined to fight if need be.\u201d", "Cinzia replied a moment later.", "\u201cWe set out as soon as we could after finding out\u2026 but it was already too late. Going to Arden Valley was still impossible with a quickly formed rescue team, so we gathered our troops and prepared supplies\u2026.\u201d", "She heaved out a deep sigh in the middle of her sentence.", "\u201c\u2026But it was just too late. The Federation said they would be retreating as well. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "Cinzia apologized yet again.", "Teresa\u2019s complexion, who had been enraptured with joy, quickly sunk. Saying they were committed and determined in the past tense\u2026 saying that the Federation was retreating\u2026 Teresa quickly picked up on the oddity and carefully asked.", "\u201cAbout the other groups\u2026.\u201d", "Cinzia did not reply. She only activated a communication crystal and handed it over silently.", "\u2014Boss?", "A voice rang out just as Teresa took the crystal in a hurry. Agnes\u2019 face appeared on the crystal.", "\u201cMiss Agnes?\u201d", "\u2014You\u2019re\u2026.", "Agnes\u2019 eyes widened before she nodded.", "\u2014The fact that you\u2019re calling me on this communication crystal must mean that you met up with the reinforcements. Congratulations on making it back alive.", "\u201cThank you. We\u2019re all safe. What about your group?\u201d", "\u2014We joined up with Miss Baek Haeju\u2019s group in the middle. We\u2019re currently heading over.", "\u201cReally?\u201d", "Rather than replying, Agnes moved her communication crystal to show Baek Haeju\u2019s group.", "This naturally meant that the Imperial Oath was safe.", "\u2014Unfortunately\u2026", "Agnes paused before smacking her lips.", "\u2014Anyways, with this, five\u2026 no, six of the seven groups\u2019 safe return has been confirmed. We just received news of Miss Hoshino Urara\u2019s group\u2019s safe return.", "\u201cSix groups\u2026?\u201d", "Teresa\u2019s eyes narrowed. Of course, it was a good thing that so many people returned alive, but\u2026 there were just too many.", "Wasn\u2019t the escape plan formed on the basis of five teams getting annihilated with the other two teams only having a chance of escaping?", "\u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d", "\u2014\u2026Of course.", "Agnes spoke with a slight hesitation in her voice.", "Baek Haeju, Philip Muller, White Tiger, and Hoshino Urara\u2026 Teresa\u2019s face distorted as Agnes called out the teams that came back.", "\u201cWhat about\u2026 the remaining group?\u201d", "Agnes closed her mouth.", "\u201cDid, did you not hear anything from them?\u201d", "Teresa\u2019s voice was trembling before she noticed. She thought things worked out well, but now that she looked at it, she seemed to have missed something important.", "\u201cWith Agnes\u2019 group\u2026 Seo Yuhui separated half-way.\u201d", "At that moment, Cinzia broke her silence and spoke up.", "\u201cShe supposedly felt that something was off and went her separate way.\u201d", "Teresa looked back at Cinzia with a dazed face.", "\u201cThen, a phoenix and a ghost apparently delivered the unconscious Seo Yuhui to the royal palace before going back. That is all we know.\u201d", "Little Chick and Flone should have been in Seol Jihu\u2019s group.", "Just then, a particular thought struck Teresa\u2019s head like a lightning bolt.", "\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t tell me.\u201d", "Teresa immediately shoved her hand in her bag and rummaged through it. The bag had been giving off heat without her even realizing it.", "Then, once she took something out of her bag, her eyes widened and her jaw dropped.", "Observatio Vitae. It was a contract that allowed one to view the lifeforce of the contractor. Teresa had once asked Seol Jihu to sign one as a means of confirming his safety before he left for the Spirit Realm expedition.", "And this contract\u2026 was burning at a fierce rate.", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "Teresa crumpled and flapped the paper to try to extinguish the fire. But nothing she did affected the blaze. In fact, it only got stronger over time and ate away at the paper.", "\u201cNo\u2026.\u201d", "She refused to believe what was happening. Right, didn\u2019t the same thing happen in the past? The Observatio Vitae had burned until only a small piece remained on numerous occasions. So, Teresa believed it would regain its original form before long, just like it always did.", "However, contrary to Teresa\u2019s wishful thinking, the blaze burned up the contract completely.", "\u201cNo\u2026!\u201d", "Quickly and swiftly, before anyone could do anything about it.", "When even the tiny corner of the contract burned to cinders, Teresa\u2019s pupils shook noticeably. Next, her expression sank in despair, and her breathing became rough.", "She had thought that something was off for a while now. Simply getting lucky wasn\u2019t enough to explain what happened.", "That was what she thought, but\u2026", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "She now realized that everyone could escape safely because one person was shouldering all the weight alone.", "She understood why Cinzia apologized.", "At that moment, a cold wind brushed past Teresa\u2019s hand. The pile of ash in her clenched hand scattered into the air.", "\u201cEu\u2026 Ah\u2026.\u201d", "Strength left her body as an indescribable sense of emptiness filled her. Her legs went limp, and she plopped down amidst the fluttering ash.", "\u201cEuu\u2026. Uaah\u2026. Huaaa\u2026.\u201d", "A choking voice flowed out of her agape mouth, and tears welled up in her eyes.", "\u201cWhy, why\u2026.\u201d", "A stream of tears and then a second flowed down her gradually contorting face.", "\u201cWhy did you come so late\u2026!?\u201d", "In the end, she shouted resentfully and burst out crying.", "\u201cIf you had come earlier\u2026! If you hadn\u2019t taken so long\u2026!\u201d", "Teresa tilted her head up and wailed loudly. Wu Lei and Yi Seol-Ah, who had yet to understand the situation, stared at the crying Teresa dumbfoundedly.", "However, Cinzia\u2019s expression was different as she had been entrusted with the Observatio Vitae once before during the Tigol Fortress War.", "\u201cHow much did he\u2026 all alone\u2026!\u201d", "A sorrowful wail resounded in all directions.", "Cinzia closed her eyes.", "And\u2026.", "*", "\u2014Heuaaaaaaaaa!", "A sorrowful cry echoed out from the communication crystal. Baek Haeju, who was staring closely at Teresa, abruptly turned around and began to run.", "\u201cMiss Baek Haeju?\u201d", "Agnes noticed her rushing off and called out, but Baek Haeju had already become a small dot in the distance.", "Baek Haeju still wasn\u2019t sure. She refused to come to a hasty conclusion until she confirmed Seol Jihu\u2019s death with her own eyes.", "But when she saw the white paper burning up and Teresa crying like a deranged person, an inexplicable sense of foreboding crept up in her heart.", "\u2018At this rate\u2026\u2019", "It\u2019s going to be too late.", "Baek Haeju bit her lower lip. While urgently running, she took out the communication crystal, hoping that the worst-case scenario she was imagining wouldn\u2019t be true.", "\u2018Please, please\u2026!\u2019", "Infusing mana into the communication crystal, Baek Haeju traversed the area at a frightening speed.", "*", "Flone found Seol Jihu while she was making her way back to where they separated. She discovered a trail of blood and followed it, and lo and behold, she was able to find Seol Jihu collapsed at the foot of a hill near a valley.", "She also saw Little Chick next to him. Flone shouted in shock the moment she saw Seol Jihu. She quickly approached him while tightly clutching onto the pendant.", "Looking more closely, he was in a much worse state than she expected.", "[Are you okay? Hm? I\u2019m here! I\u2019m heeere!]", "She shouted in a fluster, but Seol Jihu did not reply. Even when she shook him, he only clunked around like a puppet with its strings cut. Never mind a semblance of lifeforce, Flone couldn\u2019t even feel his soul.", "[I, I\u2019m here\u2026]", "Flone\u2019s expression paled as she looked down fixedly at Seol Jihu. Having experienced death once, there was no way she didn\u2019t understand what happened. It was just that she couldn\u2019t accept it so easily.", "[W-What happened?]", "Flone looked back at Little Chick.", "[He\u2019s not dead, right? Right?]", "However, Little Chick didn\u2019t answer.", "\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026. I\u2019m totally fine\u2026. I\u2019ve experienced my partner\u2019s death many times already\u2026.\u201d", "The small chick only murmured quietly with its body curled up in a ball.", "[I, I came too late, right?]", "Not knowing what to do, Flone first pulled Seol Jihu up.", "[Let\u2019s go!]", "Hugging his cold body, she urged Little Chick.", "[What\u2019s there to be so depressed about? We just have to heal him! So let\u2019s go back quickly\u2026]", "Paat! A light flashed.", "Flone, who was about to climb the hill with Seol Jihu, paused.", "[A-Aren\u2019t you coming?]", "When she slowly looked back\u2026", "[\u2026.]", "She didn\u2019t see Little Chick. She only saw a small egg.", "Coming face to face with the harsh reality, Flone slowly scanned her surroundings.", "A cold, chilly corpse, a crimson spear drenched in blood, and a red egg sitting in the middle of nowhere\u2026.", "Flone stood in place for a long time\u2026", "[\u2026Agh, I\u2019m already pressed for time.]", "And then went back and picked up the egg.", "[Oh yeah, I can\u2019t forget this.]", "Next, as she bent down to pick up the blood-smeared Spear of Purity, she suddenly dropped her head.", "[Why aren\u2019t you saying anything\u2026.]", "Hic. She sniffled. Flone\u2019s body shook, and drops of blood fell from her tightly shut eyes.", "[Sorry\u2026.]", "Apologizing while tightly holding onto Seol Jihu\u2019s cold corpse\u2026", "[Sorry\u2026. Sorry\u2026.]", "She climbed the hill, sobbing.", "*", "The sun that hung in the middle of the sky eventually set over the horizon. It was around this time that Seo Yuhui abruptly woke up.", "When she opened her eyes, she saw a soft bed and the insides of a luxurious room.", "What happened?", "After dazedly looking around the room for a few seconds, she suddenly widened her eyes and jumped out of the bed like a wasp stung her butt.", "She shook her head left and right before finding a terrace and throwing the door open. And then she saw an all too familiar city.", "\u2018This is\u2026.\u2019", "Haramark.", "Seo Yuhui blinked her eyes as she blankly stared at the sunset-washed city. If she didn\u2019t see wrong, the entire city had flickered with light just now.", "Seo Yuhui subconsciously tilted her head back, her pupils trembling. The sky dyed in a dusky sunset became bright for a moment.", "It repeatedly went bright and dark. It was almost as if something was exploding far beyond the atmosphere outside of the human eyes\u2019 reach.", "Then\u2026", "Paat! With an intense light bursting out and disappearing, the sky regained its original color.", "Seo Yuhui continued to stare at the sky despite it returning to normal\u2026", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "And she let out a soft groan.", "A shining object fell from the red sky. Showing a long tail like a comet, it quickly disappeared into the horizon where the sky met the earth.", "A star had set.", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui\u2019s mouth slowly opened as if she wanted to call out to someone.", "Unable to overcome a sudden wave of dizziness, Seo Yuhui\u2019s body shook strongly. She lost balance, and her knees hit the terrace floor. Her hands, which were placed on the guardrail, also fell forward helplessly.", "After dropping down, Seo Yuhui did not move in the slightest, like someone who had gone mad from a great shock.", "She only kept staring at the sky where the star had set with a blank face.", "This lasted all night long until King Prihi came to see her the next morning."]}
