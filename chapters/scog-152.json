Sit down.\u201d", "When the irritated Phi Sora pointed at a seat with her chin, the Yi siblings shrunk like two mice in front of a snake before finally sitting down.", "\u201cYou take a seat too, Dear. How great! You see, this carriage was waiting for more passengers to come.\u201d", "\u2018Passengers?\u2019", "Seol Jihu furrowed his brows.", "Was there a need to wait for more people with Phi Sora on board? With a High Ranker like her, most monsters should be begging to not catch her eyes.", "\u2018Well, I guess just carrying her isn\u2019t efficient. The coachman probably wanted to wait for at least two or three people\u2026?\u2019", "Seol Jihu tried to justify the coachman\u2019s choice, but this didn\u2019t seem like the case seeing how there were two other passengers on board.

Am I not allowed to ride a carriage?\u201d", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say anything.", "\u201cI understand that those kids are uncomfortable, but then you should have set off immediately. I purposely came late to accommodate them.

Phi Sora coughed lightly and dragged out the end of her speech.", "Just as she said, Phi Sora was free to go wherever she wanted. Seol Jihu didn\u2019t have the authority or qualification to stop her. He didn\u2019t have a reason to care either.", "\u201cGot it.\u201d", "However, Seol Jihu nodded his head, vowing to himself that he wouldn\u2019t sit still if she bullied the Yi siblings.", "Phi Sora crossed her arms and turned away indifferently.", "While the Yi siblings were quietly stealing glances at Phi Sora, Seol Jihu smacked his lips.", "\u2018I feel like I\u2019m forgetting something important\u2026.\u2019", "*", "The group arrived in Haramark.", "The Yi siblings looked around busily while marveling at the new city and letting out short exclamations of awe.", "\u201cAre you sure you will be okay?

Sungjin?\u201d", "\u201cYeah. But\u2026 Hyung.\u201d", "Stealthily glancing backwards, Yi Sungjin quietly called Seol Jihu.", "\u201cWhy is she following us?\u201d", "\u201cFollowing us? Who is?\u201d", "Seol Jihu turned around. Phi Sora, who came to a stop, was blocking the sunlight with her hand and looking around the area.", "\u2018Huh?\u2019", "Because she was silent the entire carriage ride here, Seol Jihu hadn\u2019t been paying much attention to her.", "\u201cUm, where is the plaza? It\u2019s been a while since I came here, so I\u2019m kind of lost.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019ll be right there if you take the main street.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "Phi Sora stared at the direction Seol Jihu was pointing to and nodded her head.", "\u201cLooks like she\u2019s lost.\u201d", "Seol Jihu explained calmly, but Yi Sungjin looked doubtful.", "Soon, the three of them started walking again. However, they stopped less than a few minutes later.", "Because Phi Sora kept following them without going in the direction Seol Jihu told her about.", "\u201cMiss Phi Sora? What about the plaza?\u201d", "\u201cDear, do you know a good restaurant? Now that I think about it, I haven\u2019t had any breakfast.\u201d", "Seol Jihu tilted his head.", "\u201cIf you keep walking and turn right when you get to the crossroad, you\u2019ll find Eat, Drink, and Enjoy. That place is good.\u201d", "\u201cAh, thanks.\u201d", "Phi Sora nodded again and, with hesitation, walked past Seol Jihu and the siblings to the main street.", "Only after seeing Phi Sora getting further away did Seol Jihu finally start moving again.", "Over at the house on the opposite side, several Priests were sweating profusely while going back and forth.", "\u2018Today too?\u2019", "Just what were they moving around that they weren\u2019t done yet?", "\u201cHeck\u2026 heck\u2026 this is the last one\u2026.\u201d", "After staring at a short Priest who was carrying a bundle in each hand and whimpering, Seol Jihu shrugged his shoulders and headed to Carpe Diem\u2019s building.", "Before going up the stairs, he turned around just in case and did not see Phi Sora anywhere.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go up.\u201d", "Seol Jihu went up to the third floor first and smiled as he saw the Yi siblings hesitating below.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. They\u2019re all nice people.\u201d", "Perhaps encouraged by these words, the siblings walked up the stairs hesitantly.", "Hoo-haa, hoo-haa. Listening to Yi Seol-Ah\u2019s deep breaths, Seol Jihu opened the office door.", "As he had notified Jang Maldong the moment he arrived in Haramark, Jang Maldong was sitting on the couch waiting.", "\u201cWelcome back.\u201d", "\u201cThank you.

He heard her knock on the door but did not answer.", "\u2018We gotta get to Huge Stone Rocky Mountain as soon as possible.\u2019", "Seol Jihu vowed to himself as he looked at the siblings who were at a loss for what to do.", "\u201cWait, let\u2019s talk for a bit. Hey, why did you lock the door!?\u201d", "Click, click!", "With the Yi siblings joining, Carpe Diem finally had an Archer. Seol Jihu immediately thought about going to train. He wanted to focus on the training he had inadvertently been putting off since he leveled up.", "\u201cHello?

Are you seriously doing this!?\u201d", "Her voice became louder.

Her face was sparkling with a blissful light.", "\u201cHaa, this refreshing smell\u2026.\u201d", "This underground room was filled with the white smoke of the Perpetual Snow and the grassy smell of herbs.", "The girl sniffing the air exclaimed in shock when she looked around the room.", "It was only natural.", "On the left shelf were different medicinal herbs, flowers, and other plants, all sorted according to their types. On the front shelf were wooden boxes emanating holy auras and medicinal bottles filled with liquids of various colors. Finally, on the right side, all kinds of beasts were sauntering around in a cage.", "This place was like a secret underground warehouse filled with all sorts of precious medicine and beasts.", "So how could the girl not be astonished?", "\u201cWow, when did you gather all these, Unni?\u201d", "\u201cLittle by little. Things just ended up being like this.\u201d", "\u201cWoah, woah, is that what I think it is?\u201d", "The girl spotted a golden-feathered bird resembling a chicken and swallowed her saliva.", "\u201cUnni, can you give me just one Golden Wind Phoenix? With this heat, it\u2019s the perfect weather for boiled chicken soup.\u201d", "\u201cStop speaking nonsense. I only have one left.\u201d", "\u201cAh, okay. Then can I have a bottle of Red Bamboo Flower Extract?\u201d", "\u201cSorry.\u201d", "\u201cThen how about the Nine Emperor Orchid? I won\u2019t ask for all of it. Just one leaf!\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Hearing Seo Yuhui\u2019s consecutive firm rejections, the girl began to tear up.", "\u201cYou\u2019re so mean\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui laughed in embarrassment.", "\u201cSorry, I need them to feed my kid.\u201d", "\u201cKid?

Seo Yuhui\u2019s arms slowly dropped down, and her complexion froze stiff. In a way, it looked as though she was overtaken with terror.

Are you okay?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d", "Then, she let out a deep sigh before continuing to clean the place more roughly.", "\u201cPlease try to understand.
