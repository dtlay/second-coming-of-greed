The Eve (1)", "content": ["After being charged with Teresa Energy which didn\u2019t lose out to Seo Yuhui\u2019s even a bit, Seol Jihu was able to regain some strength.", "Before they parted, Teresa made a request.

This is\u2026\u201d", "\u201cObservatio Vitae.\u201d", "Teresa explained.", "\u201cIt\u2019s basically a contract that allows you to observe another\u2019s lifeforce. It lets you know the person\u2019s condition no matter where they may be.\u201d", "\u201cThen will it show whether I\u2019m dead or alive?\u201d", "\u201cYes. If nothing happens to you, the contract will remain the same, but the more critical your condition becomes, the hotter it gets. And when the person\u2019s life force disappears, the contract will burn up into a handful of ashes.\u201d", "Seol Jihu nodded his head. He felt like he knew why Teresa took out this paper.", "\u2018It\u2019s not a bad idea.\u2019", "The movement of humanity\u2019s key figures including Teresa was strictly based on the outcome of his plan. If the prerequisite condition, the Revival of the World Tree, failed, it would be like hitting a rock with an egg as Cinzia had put it.", "It was the worst-case scenario that he didn\u2019t want to imagine, but if that really happened, then a fast retreat was their best move. This was where the contract came in handy.", "\u201cI understand.\u201d", "Seol Jihu placed his stamp on the contract without further hesitation.", "Teresa, who was looking at him with a slightly sad face, carefully spoke up again.", "\u201cYes. And there\u2019s another sheet underneath that.

Why aren\u2019t you stamping it?\u201d", "\u201cI mean, what\u2019s this forced child-making\u2026 How do you even do that?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Today is an unsafe day for me so there\u2019s a high chance. We can do it.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? Whether it\u2019s a safe day or an unsafe day\u2026 why would we need to do that?\u201d", "\u201cBecause if something happens to you, then I won\u2019t have any reason to live anymore. But if we have a child, I\u2019ll barely be able to cling onto my life.

Didn\u2019t you know!?\u201d", "In the end, the man and woman got into another fight despite meeting each for the first time in a while.", "However, a quarrel between husband and wife was like cutting water with a knife. After arguing for a while, the two smiled as if nothing happened before parting.", "*", "It was evening by the time Jang Maldong returned.", "Seol Jihu exchanged greetings with Park Woori and Yoo Yeolmu, whom he hadn\u2019t seen for a while.", "They both looked happy to see him, but they soon shakily escaped to their rooms. Their faces were filled with fatigue, showing how hard Jang Maldong worked them.", "Eun Yuri was the same, but she remained to hear Seol Jihu\u2019s story.", "\u201cYou\u2019re taking on yet another difficult task.\u201d", "Jang Maldong sighed after hearing his explanation.", "The salvation of the Spirit Realm.", "Not to mention the average Earthling, even the Federation deemed the task as impossible.", "Seol Jihu did manage to come up with a method, but Jang Maldong couldn\u2019t help but worry for him. Despite that, however, Jang Maldong knew that it was something that had to be done.", "\u201cYou have to be careful.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have more people helping me than you think.\u201d", "\u201cAlright. I suppose that\u2019s good news in the midst of all this.\u201d", "Like always, the two ended their conversation in a simple manner and rose from their seats.

She silently trailed after him with the face of wanting to say something.", "Seol Jihu didn\u2019t mind her.", "He sat at the log table and chatted away whatever that came to his mind, like how her training had been and whether she had visited this pub before.", "\u201cThis pub was my first starting point.\u201d", "After draining a mug, Seol Jihu spoke with a tipsy voice while looking around him. His voice was slightly drowned out by the loud rackets of the Earthlings that filled the pub.", "\u201cThis is where everything started. I joined Samuel\u2019s team as a porter, got in contact with Carpe Diem, went to the Forest of Denial and met Flone\u2026\u201d", "\u201cMhm.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not all. It\u2019s just, everything that ever happened took place at this pub. I drank here while looking for a teammate because of some request and got in a fight for no reason at all.

Will I\u2014\u201d", "He felt like he was now drunk talking, but Seol Jihu didn\u2019t care and continued.", "\u201cWill I be able to\u2026 come back here\u2026 with my friends\u2026 and laugh and talk\u2026 and drink together again\u2026?\u201d", "Eun Yuri, who had been silently eating the snacks on the table suddenly froze.", "\u201cWill I, or will I not\u2026 Who knows what will happen this time\u2026\u201d", "Seol Jihu let out a giggle while smiling tiredly.", "\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice if I can this time, too\u2026 Ah.\u201d", "The moment when he suddenly shoved his hand into his pocket\u2026", "\u201cOppa.\u201d", "Eun Yuri quietly spoke.", "\u201cYeah?\u201d", "\u201cThat expedition\u2026 can I\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Seol Jihu refused her without listening to the end.", "\u201cI\u2019ve grown much stronger since the time you saw me at the Neutral Zone.

I already have an Essence of Soma. I considered giving this to someone else, but no matter how I thought about it, giving it to you seemed to be the best choice.

The fate of the Federation and humanity depended on whether they succeeded or not.", "Would they survive once again, or would they perish just like this?", "Seol Jihu\u2019s shoulders felt heavier once he thought about that.

Behind them was a giant fish-shaped monster that had tentacles sprouting from all over its body.", "The Temerator.[1]", "Every time it gaped open its mouth, Parasites poured out of its mouth and gills. If Medusas were the final evolved form of middle-rank Parasites that gave birth to lower-rank Parasites, then Temerators were the final evolved form of upper-rank Parasites that gave birth to middle-rank Parasites.", "And behind it was a monster the size of a building whose entire body was covered with spikes. When its body suddenly expanded to the verge of exploding, a mammoth-like monster with nine heads slipped out.", "The name of the monster that quickly returned to its original size like a deflating balloon was Regina. They were the final evolved form of the pinnacle-rank Parasites that gave birth to upper-rank Parasites like demons or hydras.", "Behind the Regina were Nests that almost numbered 300, their bodies bulging as if breathing.", "Nests were categorized into lower-rank, middle-rank, upper-rank, and pinnacle-rank based on their accumulated nutrition, births, and experience.", "They weren\u2019t much to look at when they were lower-rank, but they became able to give birth to Medusas when they evolved to middle-rank and to Temerators when evolved to upper-rank. When they evolved to the pinnacle-rank, their pollution ability reached the peak while simultaneously becoming able to give birth to Reginas.", "In other words, the Nests were the foundation of the Parasite army, the source of their infinite troops.", "It was no wonder that the Nests were treated like treasures amongst the Parasites since they were containers that held the Parasite Queen\u2019s most important Authority \u2014 Life Creation and Pollution.", "Adding onto the corpse army composed of multiple species gained through their wars, the heavens and the earth became dyed in an ash-gray color.", "The Parasite Queen shuddered, breathing in the rotting stench that covered the entire Empire.", "It would have been great if things ended here, but this wasn\u2019t the end. The Parasite\u2019s main force \u2014 the Seven Armies \u2014 responsible for causing the Federation and humanity to fall into despair, had to be included in the calculations.", "[Finally, everyone is here.]", "The Parasite Queen\u2019s confident voice rang out as she looked down from the Corrupted Throne.", "In the grand hall stood many individuals that emitted strong auras, awaiting her command.", "Excluding \u2018Raging Temperance\u2019 who was sent to wipe out the remnants of the Spirit Realm, all six Army Commanders were gathered in one place.", "1.
