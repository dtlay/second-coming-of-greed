{"cid": "119", "title": "Chapter 119. Result of Stage 1 (2)", "content": ["The scream belonged to Lara Wolff. Seol Jihu stopped the conversation and hurriedly crossed over to the next room. There, he saw a short-haired girl full of sweat on her forehead. Although she was panting as if she had raced here at full speed, she still looked extremely happy. ", "\u201cI figured it out! I figured it out!\u201d ", "Lara wiped her forehead and shook the paper in her hand. When Seol Jihu walked closer and inspected it, he noticed that it was a map. He turned to Snake Eyes, who promptly raised her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She took the map and suddenly ran around like a crazy bitch.\u201d ", "Snake Eyes gestured at the door with her chin. It was the door they had opened to enter this room. ", "\u2018She went back the way we came from?\u2019 ", "Seol Jihu also had a guess, so he asked, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you figure out? So noisy.\u201d Straight Face also asked. ", "Lara made a V-sign with her hand, \u201cI went back the way we came from.\u201d Then, she folded her middle finger, \u201cAnd I found out where we are.\u201d", "In other words, she had figured out the general shape of Stage 1. ", "Straight Face stepped out, \u201cSay it.\u201d ", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cYou said you figured it out, right? Tell us how this place is laid out then.\u201d ", "Lara was dumbfounded by her tone that resembled a loan shark. She seemed to be saying, \u2018it\u2019s going to get ugly if it\u2019s nothing important.\u2019 However, she quickly got her act together. ", "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. The shape of Stage 1 is most likely a rectangle.\u201d ", "\u201cRectangle?\u201d ", "\u201cYes. You went straight from the first room. That was to check the length of the labyrinth, right?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Hnng,\u201d Straight Face let out a nasal hum. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re not completely stupid.\u201d ", "\u201cIt was a piece of cake.\u201d", "\u201cStrange. I remember a certain someone saying she would act independently just an hour or two ago\u2026\u201d", "\u201cKeuk\u2014\u201d Lara clenched her teeth. \u201cT-That\u2019s!\u201d", "But when Straight Face waved her hand, shutting down her protest, Lara continued her explanation. \u201cWe went through 40 rooms from the first one we started in before the frontal door disappeared, so it should be right to assume the labyrinth has a vertical length of 40 rooms.\u201d ", "Snake Eyes rolled her eyes. \u201cHuh\u2026 you\u2019re right. Then, including the room where we turned left, how many doors did Prince Charming open\u2026?\u201d", "\u201c120. He opened 120 doors, and none of the rooms had a door on the right side. And there wasn\u2019t a frontal door in the 120th room.\u201d ", "\u201cAah, so if the labyrinth really is a rectangle, then we should be at the top-left corner.\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it too early to decide?\u201d Straight Face spoke up at that moment with her unique, condescending smile. \u201cIf my memory serves right, there were three doors in the room where we changed direction.\u201d", "\u201cAh, you\u2019re right. There was a door on the right too.\u201d Snake Eyes agreed with a nod. Lara stared at Straight Face for a brief moment before grabbing the end of her hair. Then, she narrowed her eyes as she fiddled with her hair. ", "\u201cOh\u2026 Didn\u2019t I just tell you where I went\u2026?\u201d She made her voice airy, clearly imitating someone. Straight Face\u2019s expression stiffened. Seeing this, Lara quickly put her hand down. \u201cR-Right, so I went back to open the door on the right.\u201d", "Seol Jihu, who was quietly watching the scene play out from the side, showed a hint of surprise. From the looks of it, Lara had gone all the way back, while he and Straight Face were talking. Although the group had cleaned up the rooms, she had run through 120 rooms and back?", "\u2018Well, it is a straight line.\u2019 ", "\u201cDespite how I look, I am an Archer.\u201d Lara smiled gently at Seol Jihu before continuing, \u201cThat\u2019s when I confirmed my conjecture. That room had two doors just like this one \u2013 one where I entered from and one on the right.\u201d ", "\u201cAh,\u201d Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth opened with a brief mutter. \u201cSo that room must be the top-right room.\u201d", "\u201cExactly!\u201d", "\u201cSo there are 122 rooms going horizontally and 40 rooms going vertically \u2014 a 40 by 122 structure.\u201d ", "\u201cThat\u2019s right, assuming the room we were summoned to doesn\u2019t count.\u201d", "Lara raised the map so everyone could see. The map had a \u3131-shaped pathway. Sophie spoke up after examining the map closely, \u201cIt\u2019s like a game of Snake.\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Me?\u201d", "Sophie covered her mouth and giggled at Snake Eyes\u2019 question, then shook her head, \u201cIt was a game I used to play on my electronic dictionary when I was little. You control a snake that goes around eating food that is randomly generated.\u201d ", "With an explanation, Sophie pointed at the map. \u201cAmong the rooms that are left, where do you think is the exit?\u201d", "\u201cHow should I know?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Right, then we\u2019ll have no choice but to check each room\u2026.\u201d ", "Sophie pointed at the room on the top-left corner, the one they were in. \u201cOpening doors randomly will only make the game more complicated. Since we don\u2019t know where the exit is, the best course of action would be to plan the most efficient way to visit each room. Like this\u2026.\u201d ", "Sophie moved her finger down to the bottom-left corner, then to the right, up, left, then back down. Just like a coiled-up snake, she spun her finger in a counterclockwise direction, drawing a whirlpool, before finally ending in the centermost room. ", "Snake Eyes frowned, \u201cHell, so we have to go through every room?\u201d ", "\u201cThat\u2019s only if we don\u2019t find the exit until we reach the center. But this is one of the most efficient ways.\u201d", "\u201cI agree. Looks like it\u2019s obvious what we should do.\u201d Seol Jihu agreed. The group had been running without a headlight, but they now had a clear direction. ", "When Seol Jihu gave Lara a look of praise, Lara twisted her body. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Anyone could have figured this out if we just checked the room on the right before going left\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cStill, there might have been monsters in it.\u201d ", "\u201cYes, to be honest, I was really worried\u2026 but I didn\u2019t think it was right for just the three of you to put yourselves in danger.\u201d ", "Sophie smiled faintly. Seol Jihu glanced at Straight Face in secret. ", "\u201c\u2026Ha,\u201d Seeing the glance that seemed to say, \u2018Are they still freeloading?\u2019, Straight Face let out an empty laugh like it wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy her. ", "\u201cWho knows? We still haven\u2019t seen the 39 rooms on the rightmost side.\u201d ", "Lara\u2019s shoulders dropped and a sigh came out. \u201cCan\u2019t you just say \u2018well done\u2019? You don\u2019t even have to mean it.\u201d", "\u201cWhere\u2019d you drop your conscience? Don\u2019t act so haughty after opening a single door.\u201d", "Lara shook her head, expressing her disagreement. ", "\u201cTsk.\u201d With a click of her tongue, Straight Face turned to Snake Eyes, \u201cYou.\u201d ", "\u201c\u2026Hm? Me?\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d ", "Snake Eyes tilted her head slightly, but Straight Face didn\u2019t offer an explanation and turned back to Seol Jihu. ", "\u201c80.\u201d", "Seol Jihu understood her intent and slowly nodded his head. \u201cSure. We\u2019ll switch after 80 rooms.\u201d", "Straight Face snorted, but that was all she had to say. Seol Jihu had performed beyond what he had promised and had even offered a new method. Lara had also proven she wasn\u2019t a freeloader. ", "\u201cWhat are you doing? Get over here.\u201d ", "As Straight Face urged Snake Eyes, Seol Jihu couldn\u2019t help but smile on the inside. It felt like the wound got stitched up stronger. Of course, it had yet to heal completely. ", "*", "\u201cFuck!\u201d Snake Eyes spat out a curse. Her complexion, as she looked at the frontal door, was one of exhaustion. \u201cSnake Game my ass! We should have just gone to the centermost room to begin with. We did all that work for what?\u201d ", "Embarrassed, Sophie dropped her head. The group had taken the method she suggested, but no one expected that they wouldn\u2019t find the exit before reaching the centermost room. ", "\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true. Maybe the exit isn\u2019t in a fixed room. Maybe, we have to enter every room before the exit opens.\u201d ", "When Seol Jihu sided with Sophie, Snake Eyes narrowed her eyes, \u201cWait, you\u2019re telling me that the exit might not be in the next room?\u201d ", "\u201c\u2026We\u2019d have to go through the 39 rooms on the rightmost side.\u201d ", "\u201cAAAAAAAAH!\u201d Snake Eyes pressed her temples and screamed. ", "\u201cI was all excited for the Banquet! The hell is this?\u201d ", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWhere\u2019s all the killing and backstabbing and, you know, the fun stuff? It\u2019s gotta be more hardcore than this!\u201d", "Seol Jihu wanted to say, \u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it\u2019, but he kept quiet thinking there was no reason to provoke her. Judging by what Snake Eyes was saying, the Banquet was supposed to be much more difficult.", "\u201cAh, fuck. I want to say fuck it all to the Banquet or whatever. I\u2019m going to cry if Stage 2 is like this too\u2014\u201d Snake Eyes spat out one complaint after another before pushing Straight Face to the side and throwing the door open. Taken aback by Snake Eyes\u2019 sudden action, Lara moved to stop her but stopped almost immediately. ", "With Snake Eyes\u2019 skills, it was likely that she acted after checking for any potential threat. More importantly, her spazzing eyes seemed to be searching for a target to vent her anger. ", "Soon, the word, \u201cFUCK!\u201d, rang out from the room. The six of them, who stepped into the room late, all stood stunned as if they had all promised to react the same way before entering.", "They saw a normal room that was no different than any of the others. ", "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t there any doors?\u201d ", "The only difference, like Snake Eyes said, was that the door they used to enter was the only door. ", "\u2018\u2026Huh?\u2019", "After examining the room slowly, Seol Jihu noticed this incongruity. ", "\u2018The door we used to enter the room is the only door?\u2019 ", "That meant that they couldn\u2019t have entered the room through other directions. It was then\u2026 ", "Kirik! A familiar sound rang out. Drrrk! And a tremor shook the room. It was the same phenomenon they experienced in the room they were summoned to.", "\u201cThe door disappeared!\u201d Maria shouted. ", "Seol Jihu turned around instinctively and frowned. Just like what Maria said, the door they used to enter was gone. It had disappeared without a trace as if it blended into the wall. ", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d ", "Straight Face pulled out her glowing, silver longsword and slowly backed off.", "\u201cShit\u2026.\u201d", "Snake Eyes picked up her weapon for the first time as she also backed off slowly. Seol Jihu did the same while tightly holding onto his Ice Spear. The five combatants stood in a circle around the two Priests. ", "The room quickly turned silent. Maria\u2019s muffled chants were the only sound. Tension slowly seeped in, but Seol Jihu decided to first wait. Activating the Nine Eyes, he saw that the room was glowing with a golden light just like before.", "\u2018I did everything I could.\u2019 ", "Although he wasn\u2019t happy with the process, he had succeeded in preventing the team\u2019s collapse and brought all seven members here. Although one person died, he was already on the verge of death when he entered the stage, so there was nothing anyone could do. ", "Right, he had done everything he could. If the Nine Eyes wasn\u2019t lying, if this space really was a place of Golden Rule, then now was time to accept the result. ", "At that moment, a cool breeze tickled his forehead. Seol Jihu turned his head up, his eyes immediately widening.", "It wasn\u2019t just him. The seven members of the group were all looking at the slowly splitting ceiling with looks of disbelief. As if a huge box was opening up, or as if a huge bird was spreading its wings, the ceiling opened up and a clear sky revealed itself. ", "Immediately\u2026.", "Kigik! Kigiiigik! Unpleasant noise struck their ears. In the next moment, their sense of balance shook, and their bodies tilted sideways.", "\u201cUaaah?\u201d ", "Seol Jihu stopped Maria from falling and was shocked to see the walls around them going down. ", "No, that wasn\u2019t it. ", "\u201cWhat? We\u2019re going up?\u201d ", "Like Snake Eyes said, the ground they were standing on was going up. Like an elevator, the ground rose toward the opened ceiling. Once the ground passed the ceiling, the outside scenery appeared. Seol Jihu looked down in a daze. ", "He could see the ground getting farther and farther away from a rectangular structure. The shape of the labyrinth was just as Lara had guessed.", "\u201cWhat happened\u2026?\u201d Someone muttered. However, no one could answer that question. They could only guess. ", "\u201cAs I thought\u2026.\u201d Lara mumbled to herself, and everyone\u2019s gaze naturally fell on her. She flinched in a fluster and then opened her mouth. ", "\u201cAh, I meant the Banquet. I\u2019m convinced now.\u201d", "\u201cConvinced?\u201d ", "\u201cThere are several theories\u2026 but I think the Banquet really is the Empire\u2019s inheritance.\u201d ", "[Some say the Banquet is a stage created by a god from the era of the ancient Empire to carry out some sort of a test. Others say it is a game created by a grand magician for his amusement. Some even call it a lair that the extinct dragons created as a dummy.]", "Jang Maldong\u2019s words flashed by Seol Jihu\u2019s head. Lara stomped the moving ground with her foot.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you think so? The Kingdoms\u2019 technology isn\u2019t enough to make this stage. To have created something like this, at the very least, it would have to be the Empire, which is said to have reached the pinnacle of magic engineering.\u201d ", "\u2018That makes sense, but\u2026\u2019", "Seol Jihu was only half-convinced as he looked around the area. The labyrinth they left now looked like a dot. Looking at it, his lower stomach churned. He didn\u2019t have acrophobia, but he couldn\u2019t help but be a little nervous as the platform went up endlessly. ", "In the end, he had to take a couple of breaths before the surrounding scenery entered his sight. The first thing that caught his attention was a giant mountain that stretched endlessly into the sky. He couldn\u2019t see the peak, even though the platform continued to travel up since leaving the labyrinth. ", "\u201cHey, there are people there.\u201d", "Seol Jihu immediately turned his head at Snake Eyes\u2019 words. The place she was pointing to was several hundred meters away, so he couldn\u2019t see well with his naked eyes. But that didn\u2019t seem to be the case for Lara and Snake Eyes who were Archers. They both were clearly staring at a single spot. "]}
