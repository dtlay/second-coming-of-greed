The trial to become an apostle is something that the Seven Gods bestow to individual Earthlings. So long as they or their organizations remain quiet, there is no way for the public to know. Meaning, it\u2019s entirely possible that new Executors have been selected for both envy and gluttony.\u201d", "Cinzia continued slowly.", "\u201cI am bringing this up because I received news that Pride has recently selected a new apostle candidate.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes lit up.", "\u201cThe Executor of Superbia\u2026 May I know who it is?\u201d", "Cinzia did not reply.

She didn\u2019t lose out to anyone in terms of strength either. Simply based on these two points, there was no reason to disqualify her.", "There was only one thing that bothered him.", "\u201cSo Sicilia will have two Executors.\u201d", "\u201cI thought so too and was happy at first.

I knew you\u2019d get there eventually, but I didn\u2019t think it would be this quick. Getting the apostle\u2019s trial at Level 6\u2026 Well, I suppose there\u2019s no rule forbidding it.\u201d", "Hearing this, Seol Jihu gave a subtle smile.", "\u201cIt seems we need to talk a little more.\u201d", "\u201cAre you asking me out on a date?

I lost.\u201d", "Agnes huffed as if she was more than a little upset.", "Cinzia doubted her ears.", "Agnes, who could vie for first place after becoming a Unique Ranker, lost?", "\u201cIn terms of technique too?\u201d", "\u201cJust when I thought I had him, the back of his spear suddenly struck my ribs. I managed to hit his face a beat later, but Representative Seol had lessened the impact by pulling his head back.

As expected of Miss Agnes, you\u2019re on a different level compared to those bastards in prison, he said.
