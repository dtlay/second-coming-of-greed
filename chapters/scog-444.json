{"cid": "444", "title": "Chapter 444. While He is Gone (1)", "content": ["The second Imperial Oath expedition.", "The series of incidents, which began with the Parasite\u2019s surprise attack on Nur, ended when the expedition of 21 members infiltrated the Empire at the risk of their lives and achieved their initial goal.", "The expedition seemed to have ended in success as the team retrieved the stele and its twenty members returned safely, but that was far from the truth because, as it turned out, the Parasite\u2019s actual goal was not the stele. The Federation and humanity had been running circles on the Parasite Queen\u2019s palm the whole time.", "The expedition was over, but the team didn\u2019t break up. Once out of the Parasites territory, they moved to Haramark\u2019s base of operation, the Arden Valley fortress, all to wait for the last expedition member who had yet to return.", "Chohong sat cross-legged at the highest guard post in the valley. She had been observing the road near the valley\u2019s entrance since early in the morning without moving a muscle.", "Kazuki, who was carrying a tray of breakfast, sighed when he saw Chohong. Today wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d done this. Chohong had been looking down the road ever since she arrived at the valley fortress. She ate at the guard post and slept at the guard post, even though she knew exactly what had happened.", "And it wasn\u2019t just Chohong. Everyone knew what happened to Seol Jihu. Teresa\u2019s Observatio Vitae became a pile of ashes, and Eun Yuri confirmed his death with Roselle.", "\u201cFood\u2019s here.\u201d", "Kazuki put the tray down next to Chohong, but she didn\u2019t even look. Kazuki said nothing. He\u2019d grown tired of persuading her. And it wasn\u2019t like Chohong was the only one in this state. She\u2019ll eat when she\u2019s hungry. Kazuki muttered to himself and turned around.", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "But he stopped just before he set foot on the slope because he remembered something.", "\u201cIt looks like he\u2019ll arrive tomorrow morning.\u201d", "Chohong flinched slightly.", "\u201c\u2026Where?\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure. We\u2019ve barely figured out his current location.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cWait for him. Don\u2019t do anything rash.\u201d", "Kazuki said before continuing down the slope.", "The next morning.", "The rain had been falling since dawn. What began as a drizzle soon became a downpour that fell mercilessly over the fortress as if a hole had been punched through the sky full of dark clouds.", "Chwaaaa\u2014", "Peering through the heavy rain, Yi Seol-Ah spotted a man in the distance approaching the fortress.", "\u201cLook! Over there!\u201d", "She yelled in surprise.", "Although the figure staggered, he was very much moving. This could only mean one thing\u2014 he was still alive. Even Kazuki widened his eyes.", "But after a closer examination, they realized that the black smoke surrounding the man\u2019s body was the one moving him.", "As the man got near, they could clearly see his drooping head, dangling arm, and two legs dragging on the wet ground, leaving long marks behind them.", "The gate opened.", "Flone floated through the gate with her left arm wrapped around Seol Jihu\u2019s neck. As she slowly raised her head, everyone\u2019s dazed eyes turned to her.", "[We\u2019re back\u2026.]", "Flone was still crying. Her tears of blood mingled with the falling rain and spread like watercolor across her cheeks.", "After a moment of silence, she carefully laid Seol Jihu on the ground before everyone. Then she placed the Spear of Purity and the red egg next to the body.", "Finally, the last member of the expedition team had returned.", "Everyone fell silent when they saw Seol Jihu.", "The man lying on the ground hardly felt familiar after the rain washed away the blood covering his body and revealed traces of the struggle.", "His wounds could only be described as gruesome. It was enough to make those watching shudder in horror.", "Seeing his blue lips and dark bags under his eyes, Yi Seol-Ah began to sob. The condition of his body was proof of how desperately he fought.", "Suddenly, a woman staggered forward. She flopped beside the body and began reciting holy spells. This woman was\u2014 Seo Yuhui.", "Muttering cure spells over and over again, Seo Yuhui seemed beside herself.", "\u201cArm\u2026. His arm\u2026.\u201d", "Her fingers fumbled over Seol Jihu\u2019s right shoulder, where his arm had been cut off. She soon raised her hand into the air, took out an altar, grabbed all the offerings she could find in her Dimensional Pocket, and placed them on the altar.", "Philip Muller eyed Eun Yuri. Eun Yuri bit her lower lip and quickly cast a spell. When she finished drawing two circles with her finger, Seo Yuhui, who was about to bow to the altar, fell to the ground.", "Had Seo Yuhui been in her normal state of mind, she easily would have resisted a simple sleeping spell like the one Eun Yuri just used. But because her mental strength had been significantly weakened, she could not resist the spell and thus fell unconscious.", "\u201cThe Parasite Queen never cared about the stele\u2026. I think she was after Oppa from the beginning.\u201d", "After Oh Rahee took Seo Yuhui inside, Eun Yuri began to speak.", "\u201cThe entire Parasite army, even the ones that were supposed to come after us, went after Oppa\u2026. They went as far as to perform the Wheel Tactic against him\u2026.\u201d", "In a small but clear voice, she told everyone everything she had learned from Roselle.", "\u201cAfter we parted\u2026 he couldn\u2019t rest a second\u2026 surrounded by the enemy, he fought continuously, endlessly\u2026.\u201d", "For 12 days straight.", "\u201cEven against the army of tens of thousands of parasites\u2026 he just wouldn\u2019t fall\u2026 so the Parasite Queen and the six Army Commanders had to step in\u2026.\u201d", "Eun Yuri paused while talking, then clenched her teeth.", "\u201cThe truth is\u2026.\u201d", "There was one thing her teacher emphasized that everyone should know.", "\u201cOppa\u2026 knew.\u201d", "Roselle told her they should be grateful to Seol Jihu. She said to her that even kneeling in front of him and bowing a hundred times wouldn\u2019t suffice.", "\u201cHe realized the Parasite Queen\u2019s true intention the moment he escaped\u2026.\u201d", "Because\u2026.", "\u201cAnd he was relieved\u2026.\u201d", "There was no way Seol Jihu didn\u2019t know that walking into the enemy\u2019s trap would reduce his chance of returning alive to almost zero.", "Nevertheless, Seol Jihu did not run away. He walked into the trap, knowing it was a trap. And it wasn\u2019t to prove anything. He only wanted one thing and one thing only. He wanted his comrades to escape safely.", "For that reason, Seol Jihu raised his spear without hesitation. Worried that the enemy would start chasing his comrades, he chose to confront the Parasites head-on, even at the risk of his death.", "\u201cIdiot\u2026.\u201d", "Phi Sora pouted, her eyes red from crying.", "\u201cI told you not to mind it\u2026.\u201d", "She wiped her tears with her hand.", "Kazuki quickly approached Chohong from behind and grabbed her arms so she couldn\u2019t move. Chohong\u2019s breathing had become irregular and her hand holding the Thorn of Steel was shaking. Her bloodshot eyes filled with tears and she looked just about ready to storm into the enemy territory.", "\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d", "\u201cThink about what?\u201d", "\u201cYou know what I mean. It\u2019s too late to do anything.\u201d", "\u201cLet go. Get off of me! Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s body shook as if about to explode.", "\u201cDoes that look like a human body to you? No, that\u2019s a piece of butchered meat! I\u2019ll do the same to the Parasites! Those fuckers\u2026!\u201d", "Chohong screamed at the top of her lungs, struggling to escape from Kazuki\u2019s grip. All of a sudden, a hand the size of a pot lid grabbed her arm. She tried to shake it off, but the hand only pressed down harder.", "\u201cLet go\u2026!\u201d", "\u201cStop it.\u201d", "Just as she was about to explode, she heard a gloomy voice.", "Chohong turned around.", "A puzzled look flashed across her face.", "It was Hugo who caught her arm. He looked calm and serious, which was unusual for him. The blood veins forking out over the whites of his eyes were proof that a myriad of emotions was flying through his mind, but she could see that he was holding them back with all his might.", "Hugo spoke with his eyes fixed on Seol Jihu.", "\u201c\u2026He\u2019s here now.\u201d", "That was all he said. It was only three words, but when she heard them, Chohong felt all strength leave her body.", "A drop of tear rolled down Hugo\u2019s cheek and mingled with the rain. It wasn\u2019t just Hugo. Marcel Ghionea was also crying. His face was wet with rain, but the streams of water trickling down his cheeks were, without doubt, tears of resentment toward the Parasites.", "Thud!", "The Thorn of Steel slammed into the ground and Chohong\u2019s head dropped at the same time. Sadness contorted her face and she sobbed. As if that was a cue, stifled sobs slowly began to fill the fortress.", "\u201cThe rain is getting heavier\u2026.\u201d", "King Prihi, who had been quiet until then, raised his head toward the sky.", "\u201cWe should bring him inside before it gets colder.\u201d", "At Prihi\u2019s words, Jan Sanctus opened the wooden casket that they had prepared beforehand.", "Teresa lifted Seol Jihu from the ground and carefully laid him down in the casket.", "Before closing the lid, she took Seol Jihu\u2019s pale, lifeless hand in hers.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you worry.\u201d", "Teresa whispered at Seol Jihu, who seemed sound asleep.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll protect Paradise until you return\u2026.\u201d", "She kissed him on his cold forehead and closed the lid. Then she covered the casket with a piece of white fabric.", "\u201cOur hero has returned to us.\u201d", "Prihi announced solemnly.", "\u201cTreat him with respect and courtesy that he deserves.\u201d", "Jan Sanctus and his soldiers marched deeper into the fortress, carrying the wooden casket on their shoulders. The hero\u2019s comrades followed the procession with solemn faces.", "The rain continued to fall, wetting the cloth covering the casket\u2026.", "*", "Haramark\u2019s royal family sent Seol Jihu\u2019s body to Eva. With that, the news of his death spread rapidly, and the Eva royal family, who was eagerly waiting for Seol Jihu\u2019s return, was thrown into a frenzy.", "According to the rumors, Charlotte Aria kept repeatedly fainting after hearing the news, and even Sorg K\u00fchne had refused to come out of his room.", "The situation in Valhalla was not much different.", "\u201cWho did you say was dead? Who? Impossible! That\u2019s impossible!\u201d", "Jang Maldong\u2019s shout echoed throughout the building.", "\u201cMaster Jang! Please calm down\u2026!\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s desperate plea was also heard.", "\u201cOut of my way! I\u2026 I have to go see him\u2026. Cough, cough!\u201d", "\u201cMaster? Master!\u201d", "Yi Sungjin, who was agonizing over whether to enter or not, quickly pushed the door open when he heard Kim Hannah\u2019s request for help. He, along with Kim Hannah, forced Jang Maldong to calm down.", "\u201cHaaaaa\u2026.\u201d", "Her hair messy and loose, Kim Hannah gave a deep sigh. She looked less than ideal due to a severe lack of sleep during the last few days.", "\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d", "After a moment of hesitation, Yi Sungjin turned toward Kim Hannah. She had black bags under her eyes.", "\u201cShouldn\u2019t you hurry?\u201d", "Kim Hannah, who had been sighing without rest, threw a glance at Yi Sungjin.", "\u201cI know\u2026 I\u2019m leaving soon. I already finished the prep work.\u201d", "\u201cPrep work?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d", "As she replied in an exhausted voice, a streak of worry crossed her brow.", "\u201cIt should be happening around now\u2026.\u201d", "A few days ago.", "It was past midnight and the air was chilly.", "\u201cHeuuuuu!\u201d", "Seol Jihu woke up with a start. His eyes shot wide open and he gasped and panted as if he had just escaped a nightmare.", "His blurred vision began to clear and he saw a familiar pattern on the wall.", "He was in his room.", "For a moment, he lay in silence, blinking his eyes rapidly, but soon he kicked his blanket out of the way to get up. That was when a sudden wave of dizziness swept through him.", "\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d", "With a grunt, Seol Jihu flopped back on the bed.", "\u2018It\u2019s cold\u2026.\u2019", "Gritting his teeth, he wrapped his arms around himself. He couldn\u2019t stop shivering, and his head was throbbing as if he was hungover. He had never felt so sick.", "\u2018Did I drink too much last night?\u2019", "Lying sprawled on his bed, Seol Jihu only moved his eyeballs to scan the room. He couldn\u2019t see any bottles or glasses nearby.", "\u2018\u2026Huh?\u2019", "Suddenly his head tilted slightly in confusion.", "\u2018Was my room\u2026 always this clean?\u2019", "There was a thin layer of dust on the furniture, but overall his room seemed to be in good order. The ashtray in which he had built a tower of cigarette butts was also gone.", "\u2018Did Seonhwa come by? Or\u2026 wait a minute.\u2019", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed. Something felt odd.", "\u2018I went to visit Seonhwa yesterday\u2026. She gave me 2 million won and I came home with it, and then\u2026?\u2019", "Seol Jihu frowned. He tried to keep calm, but the more he tried to remember what had happened, the more disorganized he began to feel.", "He was dumbstruck. Why did he think something that had happened more than a year ago just happened yesterday?", "Seol Jihu took a deep breath and tried to organize his thoughts.", "\u2018No, I\u2026.\u2019", "That\u2019s right. It wasn\u2019t yesterday that he met Yoo Seonhwa. That happened much longer ago. And afterwards, he\u2026.", "\u2018Hmm? Huh?\u2019", "No, after he came back from Seonhwa\u2019s house\u2026 that day\u2026.", "\u2018I had a weird dream\u2026?\u2019", "Yes, he had a dream, though he couldn\u2019t remember what it was about. After he woke up, he wandered around the neighborhood for a while. Then, in Tancheon\u2026.", "\u2018I think\u2026 I met someone\u2026?\u2019", "Holding his head in his hand, Seol Jihu whimpered.", "\u2018The person I met was\u2026.\u2019", "When he tried to remember, an extremely powerful stab of pain jolted his brain, causing his eyes to jerk open.", "\u201cAak!\u201d", "A scream burst again from his lips. The pain grew sharper as scenes from the past began to flash through his mind. The problem was that these scenes were only a segment of the whole, a still picture cut from a filmstrip.", "\u2018What the\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu clutched his head at the sudden jumble of memories.", "\u2018What\u2019s going on\u2026!?\u2019", "The motive, the cause, he remembered none of it. All he could recall was the end result.", "\u201cKeuaaaa\u2026.\u201d", "With a groan, Seol Jihu rolled across the floor of his room.", "\u2018No\u2026.\u2019", "He squirmed from side to side over the hard floor before suddenly raising his head.", "\u2018Somebody, please\u2026!\u2019", "His eyes caught the cell phone connected to the charger in the corner of the room.", "\u2018Why do I have two cell phones?\u2019", "Even while feeling sick to his stomach, Seol Jihu managed to grab the right one. He tapped on the screen and clicked on the call icon with his shaking thumb.", "\u201c\u2026Kim Hannah?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s brow furrowed instantly.", "\u201cYun Seora? Phi Sora? Who are these people\u2026?\u201d", "Koong. He pressed his forehead to the ground. Seeing these unfamiliar names confused him further and his headache worsened as well.", "\u201cWho are they\u2026?\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s voice began to shake.", "\u201cWhat the hell is going on\u2026!?\u201d", "He screamed at the top of his lungs. In a fit of anger, he threw the cell phone in his hand across his room and stood up.", "\u201cIt\u2019s 2018? Not 2017?\u201d", "Pacing back and forth across the room, he muttered to himself like a lunatic.", "\u201cAnd what\u2019s with this cell phone?\u201d", "He screamed after finding a cell phone he had no memory of buying. Eventually, he began banging his head against the wall to relieve the throbbing headache.", "Something big had happened in his life, but he couldn\u2019t remember any of it. He felt like he had just awakened from a decade of hibernation, but he knew that was impossible.", "He knew just before all this happened that he was doing something. But whenever he tried to remember what that something was, his headache worsened, as if someone had intentionally erased that part of his memory from his brain. And that was driving him crazy.", "\u201c\u2026Fuck!\u201d", "Seol Jihu slammed his fist against the wall.", "\u201cWhat is this!?\u201d", "Then he kicked the TV and knocked the desk over. He had to vent his emotions, otherwise, he knew he would lose it.", "His neighbors seemed to have noticed the commotion he caused. Seol Jihu heard the sound of footsteps approaching.", "Ding-dong! Ding-dong!", "He heard the doorbell, he heard the knock, he heard the voice calling his name.", "But those sounds were the least of his concerns.", "\u201cUaaaargh!\u201d", "Seol Jihu was no longer his usual self, and it wasn\u2019t just because of the psychological stress of not being able to remember his past. There were physical stressors, too. He had trouble breathing, the air felt stuffy, and he felt as though his heart was about to explode. Sharp stabs of pain accompanied by a headache, seemed almost to rattle his brain.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyelashes trembled as tears welled up in his eyes. He didn\u2019t know why, but he felt empty and lost. These feelings further fueled his sense of incongruity, and perplexity spread like wildfire inside him. The pain was so severe that he wished he was dead. Because if his head really exploded, then he wouldn\u2019t have to suffer like this anymore.", "Drrrrk!", "As it was getting harder to breathe, Seol Jihu unwittingly opened the window. The cold night air brushed against his face. Panting like a beast, Seol Jihu craned his neck outside the window and dropped his head. It was then that he noticed a black sedan parked in front of his apartment building.", "When he saw the sedan, for some reason, he\u2026.", "\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes momentarily dimmed as he gazed down below.", "It was then.", "KWANG! The sound of the door breaking open resounded in the air.", "Four or five men dressed in black suits entered Seol Jihu\u2019s room.", "\u201cWhat the\u2026.\u201d", "Seol Jihu, who instinctively turned to the sound, hissed in surprise.", "\u201cWho are you? What do you want from me?\u201d", "One of the men in black sunglasses quickly looked around to grasp the situation. The room was a mess and the owner of the room appeared unstable and even aggressive.", "And if he wasn\u2019t mistaken\u2026 Seol Jihu\u2019s body was slightly leaning out the window.", "\u201cIt\u2019s worse than I expected. In that condition, even if we try to persuade him, he won\u2019t listen.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you say? Persuade me? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d", "Seol Jihu shouted and the man smacked his lips.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this is for your own good.\u201d", "\u201cGet out! If you don\u2019t leave, I\u2019m going to call the police\u2026!\u201d", "\u201cGrab him.\u201d", "Seol Jihu flinched because the language that the man just spoke was not Korean.", "The next moment four men in black suits came at him.", "Seol Jihu struggled to fend them off.", "\u2018Huh?\u2019", "When he succeeded in shaking off an arm, Seol Jihu flinched in surprise. He thought he would be no match for them, but he managed to push one of them out of his way without much difficulty. Even after that, he maintained a stalemate against four large, healthy men.", "\u201cEven without memory, he\u2019s\u2026.\u201d", "Tension ensued between Seol Jihu and the group of men.", "Suddenly, Seol Jihu heard a low voice from behind.", "\u201cIt must be the fruit of all his hard training. His body remembers what his brain has forgotten.\u201d", "Startled, Seol Jihu quickly swung his arm toward the man behind him, but the man blocked it with his palm. At the same time, his other hand holding a handkerchief covered Seol Jihu\u2019s nose and mouth. The handkerchief smelled of anesthetic gas.", "\u201cUup! Uuuuep!\u201d", "Seol Jihu struggled to free himself, but the four men quickly grabbed his arms and legs and clung to them like cicadas on a tree.", "After minutes of intense struggle, Seol Jihu\u2019s body went limp.", "Hao Win breathed a deep sigh and wiped the sweat off his forehead.", "\u201cWe have to leave quickly. Be careful when you carry him.\u201d", "Two of the men grabbed Seol Jihu from both sides and stepped out the front door. They followed Hao Win down the stairs.", "Not long after, the black sedan parked in front of the building rushed out of the alley and sped away, the sound of its engine fading."]}
