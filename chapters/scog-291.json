{"cid": "291", "title": "Chapter 291. Eun Yuri (2)", "content": ["The monster smashed its way through the trees. The Homunculus was here.", "Its appearance was definitely bizarre. Not one good thing could be said about it. The monster was at least four meters tall, but oddly slim compared to its height. Its skin was chapped and gray with occasional black spots. Because of this, Seol Jihu briefly mistook the monster for a tree.", "But once he laid eyes on its lengthy limbs\u2014 each half the length of its entire body\u2014 and its sharp, hook-like claws, he knew this creature was definitely dangerous.", "Perhaps the worst feature of it all was the shape of its skull which was much too long, as often seen in alien movies, or the two large holes representing its eyes.", "\u2018The ears are also huge. And sharp too.\u2019", "It was then that their eyes met.", "\u201cKirrrr!\u201d", "And at that moment, Seol Jihu saw the inside of the Homunculus\u2019 mouth. It was full of numerous teeth that resembled those of a shark. The monster seemed elated with its discovery of the prey.", "Immediately, the Homunculus curled up. It was preparing to jump over the cliff.", "\u2018When it jumps\u2026.\u2019", "He\u2019d gotten plenty of practice at parrying leaping attacks since the Tutorial. Seol Jihu roused his mana, wary of the enemy\u2019s attack. His machete vibrated as golden sword qi swirled around its blade, and sparks of electricity flickered beneath his feet.", "All of a sudden, the Homunculus raised its head from the curled up position.", "Kwang!", "Seol Jihu stood rooted, wide-eyed and surprised. The smell of blood stung his nose. He hadn\u2019t let his guard down, and yet, the monster\u2019s sharp teeth and crimson lining were gleaming right before his eyes.", "What an incredible speed!", "But what surprised Seol Jihu even more, was that the Homunculus flew straight at him without leaping in the air, just like a bullet. A movement like that was simply impossible without a superb elasticity.", "\u2018Damn it!\u2019", "Astonished, Seol Jihu still managed to block the attack, thanks to Jang Maldong\u2019s shadow boxing training. He was expecting the monster\u2019s movement to be similar to that of Phi Sora, and his body moved on its own.", "Slap!", "Without caving in, he used Flash Thunder to avoid the monster\u2019s attack. At the same time, he leapt forward, swinging his machete with all his might, keeping in mind the colored stone training.", "Swish!", "He felt the hit. The strange sensation of chopping frozen meat spread in his grasp. His machete had pierced the skull of the Homunculus and escaped through the back of its head.", "\u2018Did I do it\u2026?\u2019", "Suddenly, a sense of impending doom swept through Seol Jihu.", "It was not over yet. Seol Jihu quickly lowered his left arm to his ribs, and, almost simultaneously, the monster swung its arm to slap him in the chest.", "Thwack!", "\u201cUgh!\u201d", "As he felt his elbow bone shatter, Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes reflected the blue sky. When he came to his senses, his body was already in midair. Only after he crashed into a rock did the forced flight stop.", "\u201cCough, cough!\u201d", "After being thrown to the ground, Seol Jihu coughed repeatedly as his face slowly warped to a frown. A painful, burning sensation engulfed his left arm.", "He tried to endure the pain and attempted to raise himself using his machete as a cane, but the machete snapped in half, and he stumbled. Perhaps the mana of sword Qi was too exhausting on the blade, or it might have been the Homunculus\u2019 attack.", "There was no way of knowing for sure the exact cause of the break. In any case, he had just lost his only weapon. Worse still, this was their first clash.", "\u2018Shit\u2026.\u2019", "Seol Jihu cursed under his breath and got up. He grabbed his left arm, now limp from the attack, then squinted his eyes to focus.", "The Homunculus was reeling in place, half of its head missing. Though it stumbled, it quickly regained its balance. Soon, strange bubbles formed at the cross-section of its wound and new flesh began to rise.", "Having witnessed the monster\u2019s head regenerate, Seol Jihu grimaced. The Homunculus had just recovered from a mortal wound. This had to be the result of its soared regenerative abilities.", "As soon as he saw the Homunculus looking his way, Seol Jihu felt somewhat dejected. The monster wasn\u2019t impossible to defeat, but it wasn\u2019t an easy opponent either.", "In terms of raw power, the Homunculus was superior. In terms of speed, they were equivalent, but only if he relied on Flash Thunder. The problem was that the longer the battle dragged on, the worse it would start to get for him.", "He had neither a weapon nor an artifact. He could only rely on his mana and his body. And the latter wasn\u2019t perfect as one of his arms had already been rendered useless.", "\u2018Four left.\u2019", "Seol Jihu spat out saliva mixed with blood. A wave of electric currents began to encompass him. Soon, the golden qi and the monster clashed again.", "*", "Meanwhile, as Seol Jihu confronted the Homunculus, Eun Yuri took Park Woori and Yoo Yeolmu to the gacha machine.", "According to the map, there were a total of four gacha machines on this island. These machines were placed far apart from each other, and the trio had traveled to the nearest one to check the list of prizes.", "[List of Prizes]1. 1-9 coins: ramen, daily necessities, Guide\u2019s note, medical supplies\u20262. 10-49 coins: relief goods, souvenir, map, Maid\u2019s letter\u20263. 50-99 coins: Survival Points, cell phone (latest model)\u20264. 100-299 coins: potion, weapon, equipment, survival kit, combat ration, coin lottery (1-499 coins), spell ball5. 300 coins: SPECIAL6. 666 coins: offering (guaranteed)", "Seol Jihu hoped to try the standard way. In the second stage, that would be to use the gacha machine. However, Eun Yuri soon ran into a problem.", "There wasn\u2019t enough time.", "Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so hard if they were inside a closed space, like a school. But on an island this size, just walking around took a significant amount of energy, and the hints about the whereabouts of coins were obscure.", "For example, even if one knew that a coin was buried under a rock in a certain direction, there would simply be too many rocks in the said direction. Even with the help of the Diary of an Unknown Survivor, it would take Eun Yuri an entire day to check all the rocks.", "She didn\u2019t have that kind of time right now. She had to collect as many coins as possible, use them to win a useful prize from the gacha machine, and deliver the prize to Seol Jihu, all just in a couple of hours.", "How, though?", "Eun Yuri glanced back. Park Woori and Yoo Yeolmu were following her silently, but they both looked like they had a lot of questions.", "\u2018I can\u2019t trust them.\u2019", "She knew she couldn\u2019t tell them the whole truth. Though they did remain until the end back at the gathering place, they could still change their minds once they learned that Eun Yuri didn\u2019t have as much strength as Seol Jihu.", "That being said, they were the only two allies she had at this point in time. Eun Yuri was never the type to trust others easily. However, the situation called for a compromise. To get her plan going, she first had to convince the duo to help.", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "All of a sudden, Eun Yuri stopped walking. She locked her fingers together and stretched, showing off her slender figure. Then she sat down on a nearby rock.", "\u201cLet\u2019s rest up here. We should eat. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d", "When she took out food from her backpack, the two men opened their eyes wide.", "\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna sit?\u201d", "\u201cW-well\u2026.\u201d", "When Eun Yuri asked casually, Yoo Yeolmu stuttered.", "\u201cBut\u2026 is this really okay?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "Eun Yuri asked.", "\u201cHe\u2026.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu trailed off, his gaze traveling sideways. Then he narrowed his eyes, tightened his lips, and looked at Eun Yuri again, his expression stiff.", "\u201cAh. You mean him.\u201d", "With a piece of bread in her mouth, Eun Yuri answered casually.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him. He\u2019s off playing with that monster, the Homunculus.\u201d", "\u201cHuh? Playing?\u201d", "Park Woori exclaimed in surprise before his face lit up.", "\u201cAha! I knew he had a plan. Am I right?\u201d", "\u201cWell, yes, he could certainly take the monster out if he wanted to.\u201d", "\u201cHow? How?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026.\u201d", "Eun Yuri pretended to hesitate. After a while, she said cautiously as if revealing a big secret.", "\u201cHe\u2019s actually not an Invited.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s the one who invited me here, to be precise. You could say he\u2019s a special kind of Guide who can interfere with a Tutorial.\u201d", "\u201cWait, so\u2026 you\u2019re saying that he has already entered the other world?\u201d", "\u201cYes. A Contracted doesn\u2019t have these kinds of privileges. It\u2019s a bonus privilege given only to an Invited with the highest grade, the gold mark.\u201d", "When Eun Yuri opened her status window and showed them her grade, Park Woori let out an exclamation of surprise and joy.", "\u201cAh! So, this means\u2026 wait, hold on a second.\u201d", "Then he tilted his head in confusion.", "\u201cMrs, then why was he like that back there? He looked pretty bummed out alright.\u201d", "Eun Yuri flinched. She cleared her throat.", "\u201cHm. First, I\u2019m not his wife. Second, I wouldn\u2019t say he was \u2018bummed out\u2019\u2026 rather, I think his pride was hurt.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cWhen we were alone, he gave me a lot of excuses. It didn\u2019t seem like he had expected the Homunculus to enter a rampaging state.\u201d", "Eun Yuri continued.", "\u201cThough Special, this still is a Tutorial. And because he\u2019s a big shot in Paradise, not being able to control something as petty as a Tutorial is embarrassing for him. Apparently, we\u2019re being broadcasted all over Paradise, so there\u2019s the matter of saving his face, too.\u201d", "Park Woori remembered Phi Sora yelling at the sky and opened his mouth wide, convinced of Eun Yuri\u2019s explanation.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu cut in.", "\u201cBut I think you\u2019d better call him.\u201d", "He lowered his voice and continued.", "\u201cI\u2019m suspecting we have followers. And it\u2019s not just one or two.\u201d", "Eun Yuri\u2019s eyes gleamed.", "\u201cW-What? Where?\u201d", "Park Woori jumped in surprise.", "\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d", "He almost looked back but stopped at Eun Yuri\u2019s words.", "\u201cFor now, just pretend you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d", "Eun Yuri whispered and looked at Yoo Yeolmu.", "\u201cUnfortunately, we can\u2019t ask him for help.\u201d", "\u201cWhy not? At this rate, we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a test. A special kind of a test.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu frowned in confusion.", "\u201cThe truth is\u2026.\u201d", "Eun Yuri sighed.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a specific reason he came all the way to this Tutorial at the expense of using his gold stamp on me. He wanted to activate the Special Tutorial and claim the special reward. And he already achieved this goal.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t mean I was abandoned. He just wants to see me try. He said that if I can\u2019t overcome something as simple as this, I don\u2019t belong in Paradise\u2026.\u201d", "Eun Yuri licked her lips.", "\u201cSo anyway, I\u2019m being tested, and I have to prove my worth to him. That\u2019s why\u2014\u201d", "She took a brief pause and glanced at Park Woori and Yoo Yeolmu.", "\u201cI want you two to help me. If you do, I promise to pay you back twice as much in the neutral zone.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu nodded without hesitation.", "\u201cOf course I\u2019ll help. But are we allowed to do that?\u201d", "\u201cHe never told me that I couldn\u2019t form a team. And the rampaging Homunculus is the final boss of the Tutorial. Capturing it will earn both you and me a lot of points.\u201d", "Park Woori had been listening with much anxiety, but after hearing this latest comment, his eyes sparkled.", "\u201cThe test is simple. I have to find a way to defeat the final boss. But he told me that he\u2019ll value the process more than the outcome.\u201d", "\u201cThe process?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m assuming he meant he\u2019ll measure how fast I find the coins and use the gacha machine. The faster I am, the better score I\u2019ll get.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu nodded.", "\u201cHow can I help?\u201d", "\u201cI have a plan. You said you\u2019re an actor?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Although, I\u2019m not very famous.\u201d", "\u201cOkay. But first, let\u2019s go someplace else.\u201d", "Mindful of the surroundings, Eun Yuri rose from the rock. She then headed to the nearest cabin.", "The trio went in, and 20 minutes later, only one of them came out.", "\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll be right back with it!\u201d", "With a cry, Yoo Yeolmu slammed the door and began running in the opposite direction of the cabin.", "\u201cBusy, busy!\u201d", "He muttered to himself and ran as fast as he could as if some urgent quest had befallen him. In his hands was a piece of paper.", "*", "Not long after, Yoo Yeolmu stopped.", "\u201cSouth of the gacha machine\u2026 at the rock underneath the tree with a white cloth hanging on a branch\u2026.\u201d", "Muttering, he looked around and soon discovered the said tree.He then pushed the small rock underneath the tree.", "\u201cWow. They\u2019re really here.\u201d", "He exclaimed in surprise when he discovered the hidden coins.", "\u201cOne, two, three, four\u2026. Damn. It sure rocks to be the Invited.\u201d", "He smirked at the sight of the coins.", "\u201cLet\u2019s see. Next is left from the rock with the coins\u2026.\u201d", "He picked up the coins from the ground and moved about two dozen steps to the left. Then, he dug the soil beneath red flowers and, again, gave an exclamation of joy.", "\u201cAwesome! I found them again.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu straightened his back and turned around, humming to himself.", "\u201cNext\u2014\u201d", "He then smirked at the sight of a large boulder.", "\u201cPerhaps behind that boulder?\u201d", "It was quiet. He couldn\u2019t feel anyone nearby, yet Yoo Yeolmu did not stop talking to himself.", "\u201cThat\u2019s odd. I really think there\u2019d be some behind that boulder.\u201d", "Because he remembered what he saw back at where the gacha machine was.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not the coins I\u2019m talking about.\u201d", "But there was still no response whatsoever.", "\u201c\u2026Augh.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu sighed loudly as if he wanted to be heard.", "\u201cMan, you\u2019re dense. Just stop and come on out.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "\u201cI know you people have been following us. I saw you back at the empty lot.\u201d", "He announced in a deep voice and finally heard a rustle. About four or five people appeared from behind the large boulder. One of them was the young man who tried to shift blame to Seol Jihu back at the empty lot.", "\u201cFinally.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026How did you know?\u201d", "\u201cI told you, I saw you. Of course, I\u2019d notice a naked woman hiding behind a bush.\u201d", "As Yoo Yeolmu pointed out, some people in the group were either not dressed or barely wearing a top, though the young man was an exception. They were the survivors who had been captured by the pervert killer and rescued by Seol Jihu.", "\u201cDamn it! I told you this was a\u2014\u201d", "\u201cHold on. Let me just make this clear. I haven\u2019t told anyone yet.\u201d", "The young man stopped and frowned.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cI said, I haven\u2019t told anyone. I\u2019m the only one who knows you\u2019ve been following us. Do you understand?\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu asked, tilting his head back just slightly.", "\u201cNow, if you\u2019re not idiots, you should know the reason I haven\u2019t told them yet.\u201d", "A look of suspicion crossed the young man\u2019s face.", "\u201cWhat are you playing at?\u201d", "\u201cPlaying? No, no. I just had the same thoughts as you guys.\u201d", "Suddenly, Yoo Yeolmu began gazing around restlessly. Soon, he fixed his eyes on something and pointed his index finger at it.", "\u201cRight over there. Do you see that blue rock? Can someone move it?\u201d", "\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? What blue rock\u2014\u201d", "The young man stopped. There really was a faintly glowing blue rock in the direction that Yoo Yeolmu was pointing. Of the many rocks around, only this was a different color.", "\u201cMove it. Just do it, and we\u2019ll talk. It\u2019s not exactly a hard thing to do, is it?\u201d", "Still suspicious, the young man walked over to the rock and kicked it lightly. Then, his eyes went wide.", "\u201cYou see it? The coins.\u201d", "The young man hurriedly picked up all the coins and looked at Yoo Yeolmu with a dopey look on his face.", "\u201cHow did you know?\u201d", "Instead of answering, Yoo Yeolmu threw the piece of paper in his hand to the young man. The young man caught it just barely and frowned while reading it.", "\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d", "In cute, round handwriting, the note listed where the coins were hidden.", "\u201cYou were right about one thing. The Invited are different from the Contracted. Apparently, they\u2019re given a bunch of advantageous privileges from the start.\u201d", "The young man clenched his teeth.", "\u201cFuck. I knew it. This was all a scam.\u201d", "He feigned a smile then looked at Yoo Yeolmu with one eye opened wide.", "\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re showing this to me\u2026 does this mean you want to join us?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re quick. I like that.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu announced with a grin.", "\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to join you. But tell me, what exactly are you planning to do?\u201d", "\u201cWhy do you even ask? We\u2019re gonna follow them, and\u2014\u201d", "\u201cIf you think you can just take her privileges, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu cut in without giving the young man a chance to finish.", "\u201cCalm down and think for a moment. If that was possible, then I would\u2019ve taken them a long time ago, instead of asking to join you.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu was right, and the young man fell silent.", "\u201cUnfortunately, the privileges can\u2019t be stolen. They appear in the form of a message, apparently.\u201d", "\u201cMessage?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, like the status window. This means that we can neither see them nor touch them.\u201d", "The young man cursed under his breath at the unexpected turn of events.", "\u201cWhat about it? Can\u2019t we just capture her and ask her about these messages?\u201d", "Asked one of the young man\u2019s friends.", "\u201cHow are you gonna make her talk?\u201d", "\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 we could threaten her, or\u2026.\u201d", "She hesitated, and Yoo Yeolmu scoffed.", "\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cShe seemed like a tough nut to crack. What will you do if she refuses to speak?\u201d", "The woman shut her mouth. After chewing his lips nervously, the young man opened his mouth again.", "\u201cDo you have any other plans?\u201d", "\u201cI do.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu grinned.", "\u201cCome sit here.\u201d", "He took out from his pocket a map of the island and spread it out on the ground.", "\u201cA map?\u201d", "\u201cIt was inside my leather backpack. We haven\u2019t got much time, so I\u2019m gonna cut right to the chase. You are aware of the situation, no?\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu urged and the young man settled at a spot across from him.", "\u201cLet me first tell you about our\u2014 no, her plan. The bitch wants to take down the final boss.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? Is that even possible?\u201d", "\u201cOf course not.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu smiled bitterly.", "\u201cShe told me that the male Invited was buying us some time with his privileges\u2026 but I don\u2019t believe that bullshit. If her plan was to gather coins as fast as possible and activate the portal, I wouldn\u2019t have betrayed her. But she\u2019s too stubborn.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re both looking for a lifeline, so enough with the excuses. Just tell me about your plan. What are you gonna do?\u201d", "\u201cLook right here. You see all these lines and numbers drawn on the map?\u201d", "As he said, the map showed lines drawn in pen in the shape of a snail and numbers starting at one written at regular intervals in ascending order.", "\u201cWhat is this?\u201d", "\u201cThe lines represent the course. The numbers are the gathering spots.\u201d", "\u201cTell me more.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu tapped on the map.", "\u201cHer plan is simple. I am to move along this course and collect coins as they come. Then, at every gathering spot, I have to hand over all my coins to her.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s understandable. She doesn\u2019t trust me enough to leave the coins in my possession. And she\u2019s right not to trust. Look where I am now.\u201d", "\u201cThe bitch is smart.\u201d", "\u201cSo the situation is a bit difficult, but we still have an advantage.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu smirked.", "\u201cShe\u2019ll collect as many coins as she can, and then try to activate the gacha machine. That\u2019s when we strike.\u201d", "A devious look crossed the young man\u2019s face.", "\u201c\u2026So what you\u2019re saying is that\u2014\u201d", "He licked his lips like a snake.", "\u201cWe should help the Invited collect coins.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. You guys just follow us quietly from behind. And whenever I come to you with the list of hidden spots, assist me in finding the coins. That way our search will take less time.\u201d", "\u201cAnd when we\u2019re done finding all the coins\u2026.\u201d", "He glanced down at the map. Next to the gacha machine, where the line ended, was the number \u201820\u2019.", "\u201c\u2026We\u2019ll turn on her and take all her coins.\u201d", "\u201cYup. That\u2019s exactly right.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu cackled, clapping his hands in joy.", "\u201cWe can\u2019t see or even touch the privileges, but the coins\u2026.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu left his sentence unfinished on purpose. Anyone with a working brain should know what would come next. The corners of the young man\u2019s lips slowly curved upwards.", "\u201cI was just gonna take some passage fee\u2026 but this is better.\u201d", "\u201cShoot for the stars, am I right? Is there a rule that prohibits a Contracted from having a monopoly?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "The two men exchanged smiles.", "\u201cGood. Now tell me about your group. How many of you are there?\u201d", "\u201cFive here, including me.\u201d", "The young man replied, glancing over his shoulder at the party.", "\u201cAnd three more back at our cabin. So eight in total.\u201d", "\u201cEight\u2026 I see. You should try to recruit more people. That way, we\u2019ll finish the search faster.\u201d", "\u201cEven more than now?\u201d", "\u201cLook. I know you want as many coins as possible, but let\u2019s be realistic. If that monster discovers us while we\u2019re searching, we\u2019re all doomed.\u201d", "The young man seemed doubtful.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. Isn\u2019t eight enough? If we\u2019re too fast, then she might suspect something is wrong.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that. Actually, she\u2019s in a hurry. She says her plan is feasible and that everything will work out, but\u2026 why would she be in such a hurry if that really was the case?\u201d", "\u201cMm\u2026.\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu\u2019s argument sounded logical and, finally, the young man agreed. Folding the map, Yoo Yeolmu spoke again.", "\u201cLet\u2019s summarize. After we take the coins from her, we\u2019ll use 666 of them for the sacrifice, then divide the remaining coins among ourselves, in equal portions. What you do afterward is nobody\u2019s concern but your own. Draw the gacha, pay the passage fee, whatever. Got it?\u201d", "\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d", "\u201cGood. Then\u2014\u201d", "Yoo Yeolmu held out his hand, which was as big and sturdy as a pot lid, palm side up. The young man smirked. He then placed his coins on top of Yoo Yeolmu\u2019s palm.", "And so, the number of people looking for coins increased from three to eleven."]}
