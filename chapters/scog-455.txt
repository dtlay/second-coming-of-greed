He was truly like a cockroach in that aspect.", "Seol Jihu woke up the twitching Sung Shihyun and pulled him up. Then, he released him. Since the border region wasn\u2019t too far from Haramark, Seol Jihu even promised that he would not chase after them if he crossed the border with his own strength.", "Sung Shihyun let out an empty chuckle. He wasn\u2019t so foolish as to think this was mercy.", "Despite this, Sung Shihyun walked. After all, there was a chance that help might come near the border region.

However, he had to stop before he even took a few steps.", "It was because he saw Taciana Cinzia and others waiting for him at the border.

Why would you do that when everyone is watching?]", "[Ah~ You mean the public humiliation and execution show?

One was sharing their god\u2019s values, personalities, and everything else. The other was having a stronger desire.", "He wasn\u2019t sure about the former, but he certainly experienced the latter. Perhaps because he starved for so long, as Philip Muller said, he could not stop being a glutton once he began to devour food.", "It wasn\u2019t until another forty minutes went by that Seol Jihu felt full and asked everyone to stop.

For example, something with a nice alliteration like, \u2018So sad, so sad, so Seo Yuhui~\u2019", "But he swallowed the joke that was just about to come out of his throat. Gula\u2019s values, which he began to share after becoming an apostle, were strongly telling him that wasn\u2019t it.

I will tell you why I did it, why I had no choice but to do it, all of it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu swallowed his saliva. He rambled on about random thoughts that came to his mind and didn\u2019t think about whether it would be okay. Perhaps it might have been better to lighten up the mood with a joke.", "At that moment, Seol Jihu felt a faint trembling in his hands. He saw Seo Yuhui\u2019s shoulders shaking.", "Is she laughing? Was she actually pretending to be angry? Seol Jihu shoved his face forward with an awkward smile. Then, his jaw dropped.", "\u201cHic\u2026\u201d", "She was crying. Seo Yuhui\u2019s eyes were tightly shut, and streams of tears were flowing down her cheeks.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s head blanked out as this was the first time he was seeing her cry.", "Meanwhile, perhaps from the influence of becoming an apostle, Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth was continuously apologizing for making her worry, and his hand was caressing her shoulder.", "\u201cHuaaang\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui spun around. She buried her face in Seol Jihu\u2019s chest and bawled her eyes out.", "\u201cSorry\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry\u2026. Because of me, you\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui trailed off, but Seol Jihu had an idea why she was acting this way. She must be thinking that it was her fault that Little Chick and Flone separated from Seol Jihu and ultimately led to his death.", "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for me\u2026 if I didn\u2019t go back on my own\u2026 maybe\u2026\u201d", "For all she knew, Little Chick and Flone wouldn\u2019t have left Seol Jihu if it weren\u2019t for her, and maybe he would have escaped alive.", "Of course, since the Parasite Queen personally took action, the chance that Seol Jihu would have survived even with Little Chick and Flone was close to zero. However, Seol Jihu didn\u2019t say this out loud.", "\u201cUaaaaang\u2026.\u201d", "He only said it was okay, that she was wrong, and gently caressed Seo Yuhui\u2019s hair and back until she calmed down.", "Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to thank Gula.", "*", "[Wheeeeew\u2026.]", "Gula let out a sigh of relief as she watched over the pair.", "[Good job. Your naming sense is terrible, but it turns out your talent was elsewhere.]", "Luxuria also breathed a sigh of relief as if she had been scared to death previously.", "[I think I meddled a bit too much\u2026.]", "[No, I think that was very well worth it.]", "[I agree. If he had really cracked that joke back then\u2026]", "[\u2026My daughter is kind, but she would have been sulky for at least two months.]", "[Tsk, I know he\u2019s my son, but I just don\u2019t get it. How can he think about making a joke like that in that situation?]", "Gula lamented as if she was completely incapable of understanding Seol Jihu.", "[T-That\u2019s\u2026 true\u2026.]", "Luxuria reluctantly agreed. Luxuria always defended Seol Jihu whenever something happened, but\u2026", "[So sad, so sad, so Seo Yuhui~]", "No matter how she thought about it, this was just going too far.", "[Anyway, this is good to see.]", "[Mmn. Isn\u2019t this the first time my son is embracing your daughter and not the other way around?]", "[Oh my, you\u2019re right!]", "The two goddesses, who got out of their shock shortly afterward, looked at the pair with heated gazes and had a pleasant chat."]}
