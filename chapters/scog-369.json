The Awaiting One (3)", "content": ["What Seol Jihu saw when he first opened his eyes was a boulder.", "A boulder that had grown to the size of a house was filling his line of sight.", "At that moment, Baek Haeju, who was standing in front of him absent-mindedly, stretched her left arm to the side.", "Surprisingly, the boulder moved on its own as if it was remotely attached to Baek Haeju\u2019s hand, and then it rolled down.", "Only then did Seol Jihu\u2019s vision clear up.", "Seol Jihu\u2019s breath paused while being astonished at Baek Haeju\u2019s display of skill.", "But then, he was shocked speechless when he saw what was in front of him.", "It was the same for Baek Haeju. Her widened eyes were tinged with strong disbelief.", "It was because the man sitting on the altar at the mountain peak with his arms crossed and looking down arrogantly\u2026 was none other than Seol Jihu.", "Baek Haeju\u2019s head blitzed to the side.", "Seeing Seol Jihu standing dazedly behind her, she turned back to the mountain peak.", "No matter how many times she looked, there were two Seol Jihus.", "After a few seconds of being at a complete loss for words, Baek Haeju came to her senses and noticed the slight difference between the Seol Jihu standing behind her and the Seol Jihu sitting on the altar.", "Their faces and outer appearances were the same\u2026 but they had completely different atmospheres.", "There was a saying that an individual\u2019s personality was reflected by their face.", "The Seol Jihu that Baek Haeju knew was someone who was suited to a cheerful smile. His playfulness sometimes made him seem like a child, but this simplicity was what made him charming.", "However, the Seol Jihu on the mountain peak was the opposite.", "His face was dark like he hadn\u2019t seen the light of day for a long time, and his lips were tightly shut as if he was a monk practicing asceticism.", "His slightly raised brows seemed proud and sharp-tempered.", "His pupils, which were tinged with inexplicable sadness, reflected weariness at times and a fierce, demonic resentment at others.", "Most importantly, tremendous charisma emanated from his body in secret.", "It was easy to see just from the reddish-black stains and dirt spots on his rusted black armor and faded spear that he was an experienced veteran who toiled away at gruesome battlefields for at least ten years.", "It was at this point in time that Baek Haeju noticed where her feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was coming from.", "She had never met an Earthling, who gave off such powerful pressure. But thinking about it carefully, she recalled one person.", "A man who not only showed no fear against the Parasite Army Commanders but also toyed with them as if they were mere children.", "Right, it was at the Arden Valley war\u2026", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d", "As Baek Haeju\u2019s thoughts continued, an annoyed voice rang out.", "Black-armored Seol Jihu stood up from the altar.", "He dusted off his butt and trudged over.", "\u201cGo back down.

Have some shame.\u201d", "Strength entered Seol Jihu\u2019s pupils.", "He felt falsely accused.", "He wasn\u2019t trying to borrow Baek Haeju\u2019s strength to pass the trials.

Don\u2019t talk like you know me.\u201d", "Blurting out in a threatening voice, Baek Haeju raised the Tathagata spear at last.", "Black-armored Seol Jihu slowly raised his head.", "\u201cHaa. I don\u2019t want to fight you, but\u2026\u201d", "After a deep sigh, his hollow pupils suddenly flashed under the moonlight.", "\u201cI guess I have no choice. I can\u2019t give up on this chance. I\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this moment, you see.\u201d", "With an enigmatic murmur, black-armored Seol Jihu reached behind his back and pulled out a faded spear.", "It was a simple spear that didn\u2019t look all that special, but the moment it entered his hands, an inexplicable pressure emanated out.", "Suddenly, the atmospheric pressure strengthened.", "Struck with an indescribable sense of foreboding, Baek Haeju gulped unwittingly.", "The air touching her skin was sticky.", "The empty peak filled up with a sharpness that would cut anything that moved.", "The energy that the black-armored Seol Jihu was furtively releasing had materialized and seized control as soon as he grabbed his spear.", "Baek Haeju could tell that his energy easily surpassed her own. In terms of killing intent alone, it surpassed even an Army Commander.", "What was even more unbelievable was that black-armored Seol Jihu did not seem to be using his full strength.", "It was as if this show of power was only a preparation for battle.", "\u201cAre you going to just stand there?\u201d", "Black-armored Seol Jihu batted his spear.", "Their eyes met.", "Baek Haeju\u2019s expression distorted, and the corner of black-armored Seol Jihu\u2019s mouth curled up.", "In the next moment, Baek Haeju kicked off the ground. Her white ceremonial dress fluttered like a flag in a rainstorm.", "The Tathagata Spear suddenly forked three ways. The spear blade that shot out left and right curled like a whip and hurled towards black-armored Seol Jihu\u2019s face and leg.", "Of course, black-armored Seol Jihu didn\u2019t just sit still.", "He ducked down, revealing his teeth in a grin.", "Pang! The figure that disappeared with an explosive sound reappeared in front of Baek Haeju.", "Baek Haeju reflexively swiping her spear up and black-armored Seol Jihu rushing in like a ferocious beast happened at the same time.", "Clang!", "An ear-splitting metallic clang rang out.", "Next, a spear flew into the air, spinning.", "It was the Tathagata Spear.", "Baek Haeju froze with her empty hands stretched out, and black-armored Seol Jihu leaped past her and stopped after three or four steps.", "Seol Jihu, who was watching their battle, doubted his eyes.", "In truth, it ended so quickly that he didn\u2019t even get a good look.", "A single exchange was all it took to result in a one-sided loss.", "Baek Haeju looked more taken aback than ever before.", "She stayed frozen as if she couldn\u2019t believe what she just experienced.", "\u201cSurprised?\u201d", "A voice rang out behind her.", "\u201cI bet you\u2019re curious about how I know the Jade Spear Technique\u2019s weakness.\u201d", "Baek Haeju shot back.", "At the same time, the Tathagata Spear came swirling down.", "Once the green spear stabbed into the ground, Baek Haeju looked down at it before raising her head.", "Black-armored Seol Jihu reached out his hand to the spear and shrugged.", "Sparks flew from Baek Haeju\u2019s eyes.

Suddenly, a bleak look flashed on her face. She felt like she was facing off against an Army Commander who had released their divinity.", "However, she did not let go of her spear.", "She immediately retrieved her energy and fused it together, forming a huge hail of sword qi to rise up.", "Black-armored Seol Jihu shook his head. He stared at the hail sweeping down on him before raising his spear up high at the last moment.", "A red light flashed from his eyes, and a large pillar shot out from the speartip that was pointing at the night sky.", "This wasn\u2019t sword qi.", "It was too large to be considered a creation of sword qi.

The earth exploded.", "Just by hitting the ground, he caused the entire mountain to rumble.", "Swept by the aftereffect of the explosion, Baek Haeju helplessly flew into the air with other debris.", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019d rather not kill you even though we\u2019re in this space.\u201d", "Muttering bitterly, black-armored Seol Jihu confirmed Baek Haeju disappearing down the mountain before turning around.", "Seol Jihu was standing dazedly in his spot. He was just as shocked, if not more, than Baek Haeju.", "Though he couldn\u2019t be sure, the energy that shot out of black-armored Seol Jihu\u2019s spear was something beyond his current comprehension. His instincts told him that it was a technique far out of his reach.", "Black-armored Seol Jihu\u2019s strength could be easily surmised by how easily he defeated Baek Haeju, who was currently the strongest Earthling in Paradise.", "\u201cFrustrated that you can\u2019t do anything?\u201d", "Hearing his counterpart\u2019s voice, Seol Jihu snapped out of his daze.", "\u201cListen, pal.

How so?\u201d", "\u201cYou insisted on doing everything alone, so Ira purposely made cooperation a necessity in your trials.

Consider the ranks on a scale from 1 to 100, from Lowest-rank to Pinnacle-rank.

Though the numerical difference was small, raising one\u2019s physical level became harder the higher-ranked one got.", "But it was still a good piece of advice.", "Having progression be quantifiable was much better than simply knowing the different ranks and stages.
