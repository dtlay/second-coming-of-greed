It will take approximately six days from Scheherazade to Eva, so it\u2019ll be best to complete it by then.

Good luck.\u201d", "After winking at him, Yun Seohui resumed her steps.", "Everyone she met as she walked down the hall greeted her, and Yun Seohui returned their greetings with a smile.", "Because she stopped to chat with half of those individuals, she took 20 minutes to arrive at the lobby.", "After finally leaving through the front door, Yun Seohui walked down the street at sunset to arrive at a towering officetel.[1]", "\u201cAigoo, it\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve last come.\u201d", "Even the guard at the entrance amicably greeted her as soon as he saw Yun Seohui.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile Ahjussi~ How have you been lately?\u201d", "\u201cNothing much.

It was the extreme of nothingness.", "With an almost aloof face, Yun Seohui was about to hang her handbag on the hanger out of habit before pausing.", "Frowning, she let the bag in her hands drop to the floor.", "She carelessly took off her jacket and tossed it on the ground as well. She unbuttoned a few buttons of her shirt before flopping down on the rocking chair near the window.", "With practiced motions, she placed a cigarette in her mouth before lighting it.", "\u201c\u2026I\u2019m so bored\u2026\u201d", "Smoke spilled out of her red lips as she sighed.", "How much time had passed?", "As the street dyed in sunset hues darkened and the night deepened, the number of cigarette butts in the ashtray on top of the table increased one by one.", "Yun Seohui showed no movement until then.", "There was too much going on in her mind \u2015 thoughts about the meeting, or more specifically, of Seol Jihu.", "Strictly speaking, the results weren\u2019t bad.", "Negotiations only worked if both parties were equal or if the weaker side had something the stronger side wanted. It didn\u2019t apply to situations like today where the two parties were on the opposite ends of the stick.", "Not to mention that Kim Hannah was at Valhalla.", "Since she was grinding her teeth at the mention of Sinyoung, she must have been thoroughly prepared to take the utmost advantage of their superior position.", "Kim Hannah, who was skilled at scamming people in deals, would have been persistent in winning over two provisions if they gave up on one.", "Thus, immediately accepting the initial conditions offered was, in anyone\u2019s eyes, the best possible move she could have made, and in reality, she obtained the best results.", "Yes. Yun Seohui had taken responsibility and done an excellent job.", "But even so, why was she feeling so vain despite all this?", "Was it because she had to lower her head in humiliation?", "No, she had experienced countless similar situations in the past and was confident that she could endure more.", "Was it because Sinyoung\u2019s influence had diminished?", "She had been prepared for that.", "Was it because she was forced out of the position that she had sacrificed her childhood, her teens, and twenties for, which were the prime years of her life?", "This might be a part of the reason.", "Yun Seohui pondered for a while before being able to find a clue in a memory that suddenly flashed in her mind.", "A few years ago.", "Yun Seohui found a delicious-looking company in the same pharmaceutical field and had forcibly tried to push for the acquisition and merger of the company without their consent.", "However, the opposing company didn\u2019t bat an eye and returned a terrible counterattack, and as a result, Sinyoung was at risk of losing control of its own company.", "In retrospect, there had been no way out, just like this incident.", "When Yun Seohui visited the opposing company, the young female CEO of Haesol Research Institute looked at her, begging for forgiveness before saying this.", "[You\u2019re quite an interesting person, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m not being sarcastic. Really. I feel like you\u2019re similar to me.]", "[You probably feel everything will go your way, that you can grasp everything in your hands if you put your mind to it, and now living itself is boring\u2026. Am I correct?]", "[I\u2019m like that, too. Rather, I was like that. Before I met a certain person, that is. Our meeting seems like fate, so should I give you a piece of advice?]", "[The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. The world decides its own center, not you. It\u2019ll be good for you to realize this fast. You\u2019re going to die if you keep living like that.]", "[Me? I quickly stuck myself to that center as soon as I realized this. I didn\u2019t want to die.]", "\u2026Right.", "Everything was because of Seol Jihu.", "[If you can\u2019t forcibly snatch it, you can make it come to you instead.]", "[The cause and effects of every major action are surprisingly clear. And since the cause and effect is clear, retribution is even more so. Unless your brain is wired with the principle of causality\u2026]", "Thinking back about how ridiculous her first thoughts of Seol Jihu were when she first noticed him\u2026", "She only realized it after 3 years had gone by.", "Actually, she had felt it earlier, but it was already too late by then.", "She still didn\u2019t think her thoughts were wrong.", "Only, her opponent completely exceeded her expectations, making her thoughts seem laughable.", "Seol Jihu had flown past her with frightening speed, just as she was about to grab the ends of his clothes.", "He was so fast that she couldn\u2019t run after him, even if she tried.", "\u201cI think I understand that Unni\u2019s feelings now\u2026\u201d", "After talking to herself for a short moment, Yun Seohui buried herself in the chair and stretched her neck back.", "She listlessly looked up at the ceiling with lonely eyes.", "[I\u2019m still grateful for that day. Really.]", "Only that much\u2026", "[If possible, I would like to cherish the gratitude I felt towards Sinyoung back then.]", "She had sincerely helped him in Paradise and on Earth, but that was the extent of his gratitude.", "\u201cStill\u2014wasn\u2019t it too harsh to tell me to step down?\u201d", "Yun Seohui simpered and murmured to herself.", "\u201cDo you know how hard I worked to get here, and now you want me to leave everything behind and scram? Do you want me to die?\u201d", "She talked as if Seol Jihu was right there in front of her.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything.\u201d", "These were words she couldn\u2019t say during the meeting.", "Yun Seohui stared at the ceiling with a vicious glint in her eyes.", "Then suddenly, a sneer escaped her mouth. She had thought of Seol Jihu\u2019s expression when she had signed the contract without any hesitation.", "The reason she accepted everything without a word?", "Was it for Sinyoung? Since she could end everything if she sacrificed herself?", "No, that wasn\u2019t it. That was what people wildly guessed, but Yun Seohui\u2019s true intentions were completely different.", "It was because she wanted to see.", "\u2018I bet you\u2019ll be shocked if I do this.\u2019", "She had acted on a spontaneous fit of anger.", "\u201cHah!\u201d", "She suddenly burst into laughter.", "\u201cAhahahaha\u2026!\u201d", "She couldn\u2019t understand why she was laughing either.", "Then she suddenly stopped.", "\u201c\u2026What\u2019s the reason?\u201d", "She glared at the ceiling and angrily spat with a scary face.", "\u201cWhy is our Valhalla\u2019s representative so hell-bent on pushing me down?\u201d", "Words similar to that time\u2026", "\u201cHow can you do this to me?\u201d", "Once she started talking, words spilled out like a dam breaking loose.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. I wasn\u2019t the one who tried to kill you.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I really didn\u2019t know anything. It\u2019s not like I know everything. What was I supposed to do if I didn\u2019t know?\u201d", "Once she started, words poured out of her like water gushing out of a broken dam.", "\u201cI get it that you\u2019re angry. But do you know how hard I tried?\u201d", "\u201cDo you know how many times I protected you and your family back on Earth?

Why me? Huh?\u201d", "Her voice rang out in the empty silence.", "Before she knew it, Yun Seohui was crying with tears in her eyes.", "Then she suddenly snickered and broke into laughter.", "Inside the empty officetel, the sounds of crying and laughing alternated.", "\u201cHuu\u2026 Huuuuu\u2026.\u201d", "Barely managing to stop, Yun Seohui quickly took deep breaths and wiped her tears.", "\u201cAnyways, so this is how you\u2019re going to come out, huh?\u201d", "She suddenly took out a phone from her pocket and repeatedly turned it on and off.", "\u201cI\u2019ll live if I side with him and die if I don\u2019t, huh\u2026\u201d", "She muttered to herself before the end of her lips curled up.", "\u201cFine, then kill me.\u201d", "Her fingers that had busily moved stopped.", "The phone\u2019s screen was lit.", "\u201cRather than living long and thin\u2014screw it all.
