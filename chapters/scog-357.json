He probably made all that money from gambling.\u201d", "\u201cJihu applied for an entry ban to Seorak Land in March last year. I called them yesterday. They said he hasn\u2019t come back since.\u201d", "\u201cGod, you can be so naive sometimes. Are there casinos only in Korea? Don\u2019t they have them overseas, too? Ah, maybe he went on an overseas business trip as an excuse to visit a casino. Yeah, that sounds about right. Everything makes sense now.\u201d", "Seol Jinhee remarked sarcastically, her voice confident because her father had sided with her.", "\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok adjusted his glasses.", "\u201cJihu\u2019s never left the country.\u201d", "\u201cHow do you know?\u201d", "\u201cI got a call from the Hongeun-dong Reserve Army a while back. They said Jihu didn\u2019t come in for training. Because they couldn\u2019t get in touch with him, they\u2019ve been handling his case as notice non-deliverable. At first, I thought he was on a business trip abroad, but they said no. Military training is automatically postponed when you\u2019re abroad, but the Military Manpower Administration\u2019s immigration records show that he has no history of leaving the country.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok continued.", "\u201cWhich means he went on a domestic business trip. And Seorak Land is the only casino that citizens can access in our country. He really did quit gambling.\u201d", "His argument was perfectly logical, and Seol Jinhee hesitated.", "The truth was that Seol Jinhee knew how meticulous Seol Wooseok was.", "The fact that her brother was so sure meant that he had sufficient grounds to believe what he said.", "Still, her past experience advised her not to trust her brother. Seol Jihu had betrayed them far too many times.", "Her mind understood, but her heart simply wasn\u2019t convinced.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re being too lenient? Casinos are hardly the only places to gamble. What about horse racing? Illegal sports betting? Illegal casinos?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. Even at the height of his addiction, he would only play Blackjack or the slot machine at Seorak Land. Never anything else.\u201d", "\u201cBut you can\u2019t be 100% sure, can you? And\u2014 what was it again? Sinyoung? That\u2019s weird, too. Why would Sinyoung Pharmaceuticals want someone like him?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s true that he joined the company. There\u2019s no room for doubt. You know Jihu\u2019s resume has always been quite impressive. And I even called Sinyoung to check.\u201d", "\u201cYou called them?\u201d", "\u201cDid you really think I\u2019d just take his words for granted? I asked them and they immediately confirmed his position as a sales team employee. The team leader, Yun Seora, said a lot of good things about Jihu.\u201d", "\u2018No way.\u2019", "Seol Jinhee gave a snort.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s her name again? Yun Seora? Well, maybe I should give her a call myself. Obviously she\u2019s one of his friends or acquaintances.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Sinyoung\u2019s security is airtight. And I did look into it more closely. I was surprised when I found out that Yun Seora is the youngest lady of Sinyoung Pharmaceuticals.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026W-What?\u201d", "Seol Jinhee blinked in surprise.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a direct family member of Yun Seojin, the Chairman of Sinyoung Pharmaceuticals. Well, I suppose that\u2019s how she was able to become a team leader at such a young age.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok continued.", "\u201cBut that\u2019s not the end of it. When I met Jihu at the cafe next to the Sinyoung building, one of Sinyoung\u2019s directors stopped by to say hello.\u201d", "\u201cDirector?\u201d", "\u201cI recognized her. It was Yun Seohui, the eldest daughter of the Yun family.\u201d", "Seol Jinhee quickly grabbed her cell phone and searched for the name.", "She frowned.", "\u201cThis makes no sense\u2026. Didn\u2019t he say he was just an employee? Oppa, are you lying to us, too?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not lying. I wouldn\u2019t have believed it myself if I hadn\u2019t seen her with my own eyes. He must be getting a lot of attention at work.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok raised his voice.", "\u201cMy point is that I don\u2019t think Jihu could\u2019ve asked those people to lie for him.\u201d", "It did sound far-fetched that an ordinary person like Seol Jihu would make a personal request like that to the daughters of Sinyoung.", "Seol Jinhee closed her mouth.", "On the contrary, her mother was all smiles.", "Her eyes were slightly wet from tears of joy.", "\u201cI believed in Jihu. I knew he could do it if he put his mind to it.\u201d", "She nodded and sniffled.", "\u201c\u2026Father.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok cleared his throat and turned his eyes to his father.", "The man was silent.", "He was looking down at the table with expressionless eyes.", "\u201c\u2026Let me ask you something.\u201d", "Suddenly, their father\u2019s voice broke the uncomfortable silence.", "\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d", "\u201cPardon?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not only me or your mother or Jinhee who\u2019s been betrayed by that bastard. He also abused your trust and even hit you. So why are you so eager to help him?\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s right. Do you know what my friends call you? A pushover and a wuss!\u201d", "Despite Seol Jinhee\u2019s insults, Seol Wooseok remained calm and even.", "He lowered his gaze and replied in a low voice.", "\u201cThat still makes me angry when I think about it, but\u2026 I used to hit Jihu a lot, too.\u201d", "\u201cHit him? You?\u201d", "\u201cYes, when we were little. At one point, it got so bad that I almost strangled him. But Jihu\u2019s not the type to snitch, so you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok gave a bitter smile.", "His father listened to his son's confession with a dumbfounded look on his face.", "\u201cAnd frankly\u2026 I\u2019m not the only one who did Jihu wrong. You guys are accomplices, too.\u201d", "\u201cUs? When did we treat him wrong?\u201d", "\u201cWhen Uncle and Aunty passed away and we took Seonhwa and Seunghae under our wings.\u201d", "His father\u2019s face hardened.", "\u201cI understand your feelings now. It couldn\u2019t have been an easy decision for you to take responsibility for the children of your friends who passed away in an accident. But at that time, Jinhee and I were young. We were too immature to understand your decision.\u201d", "It was just like he said.", "Their intentions were noble, but the reality wasn\u2019t kind to them.", "The Seol family wasn\u2019t poor at the time, but they weren\u2019t rich either.", "Accepting two children into their home put a considerable financial burden on the family.", "Seeing their parents work overtime, struggling to make ends meet, Seol Wooseok and Seol Jinhee couldn\u2019t bring themselves to look at the Yoo sisters in a favorable light.", "And there definitely was a time when they hated the sisters for taking their mother\u2019s attention away from them.", "\u201cJihu and I fought because of Seonhwa and Seunghae.\u201d", "Seol Jihu was the one who stopped them whenever they tried to act out on impulse.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to Jihu that Jinhee, Seonhwa, Seunghae and I were able to grow together without things going wrong. Father, you know that.\u201d", "His father bit his lips.", "Of course, he knew.", "It was Seol Jihu who opened the hearts of the sisters who refused to communicate with the world after their parent\u2019s death.", "Seol Jihu was the one who acted as a mediator between Seol Wooseok, Seol Jinhee, and the Yoo sisters, making sure they all got along.", "He did what his parents couldn\u2019t do, and did what was essential to bringing the family together.", "Through all that, the little boy never once complained.", "\u201cSee you later, boss.\u201d His son used to say that phrase whenever he left for work. And when he came home at night, the boy would smile playfully and ask, \u201cDid you make a lot of money today, Daddy?\u201d", "His son\u2019s smile was what comforted him when the weight of reality crashed down on him both at home and at work. He was proud of his son, though he never really said it out loud.", "\u201cWooseok\u2019s right. Jihu may be a funny man, but he\u2019s always been quite mature since he was a kid. Whenever Wooseok and Jinhee fought over the seat next to me, Jihu would sit alone, saying he was fine.\u201d", "Their mother commented.", "\u201cOnce I fell asleep while looking after Seonhwa and Seunghye, and Jihu crawled in next to me. But I was half asleep and so tired that I pushed him away. I can't imagine how much it\u2019s hurt him. He was just a little boy\u2026 but he massaged my hands and shoulders without a word of complaint. Just thinking about that time, I\u2026.\u201d", "She wiped her eyes, wet from tears of reminiscence.", "Their father screamed with a grimace.", "\u201cWhy do you keep bringing up the past?\u201d", "\u201cFine! You don\u2019t have to see him if you don\u2019t want to, but I will. Just be quiet and stay in your room, okay? Don\u2019t disturb us like the last time.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "The father raised his voice.", "\u201cI know! I know how he was as a little kid. But why do you keep talking about the past? The bastard took advantage of my trust not once, not twice, but at least a dozen times! What more could he want? How long are you going to live in the past? The past is the past. Both you and Wooseok need to drink a glass of cold water and come to your senses!\u201d", "\u201cI understand how you feel, Father. You\u2019re right, Jihu made a big mistake. He left a huge scar on our family that probably will never be erased.\u201d", "\u201cHow can you talk to me this way knowing that?\u201d", "\u201cYou know how I am.\u201d", "Seol Wooseok replied.", "\u201cI know how you feel. I know. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been waiting so long to tell you this. I spent a lot of time thinking and finally, I\u2019m convinced.
