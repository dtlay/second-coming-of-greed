Once Hao Win left, the personal guards that had followed him to Carpe Diem\u2019s building went up to him.", "Hao Win didn\u2019t say a word and walked to the street with a somewhat stiff expression.", "Tk. A raindrop fell from the sky. Hao Win abruptly paused and tilted his head up.", "The sun was still in the middle of the sky, yet the sky was dark. Rain clouds had rolled in before he noticed, and it seemed it would rain any moment now.", "Tk, tk, tk, tk. As if to prove him right, more raindrops began to fall in the next moment.", "A man wearing black sunglasses glanced up before spreading open a jacket on his arm and approaching Hao Win.", "\u201cMing Jie.\u201d", "The man who was putting the jacket over Hao Win paused at the sudden call.", "\u201cYou once asked me why I chose Carpe Diem\u2019s leader, do you remember that?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Because he shined brighter than anyone else.\u201d", "Hao Win continued while still looking up at the sky.", "\u201cA man who accomplishes impossible feats. A witty problem-solver who brings a solution when everyone else is lost and sees the ingenious plan to completion. That is the Earthling and Irregular, Seol of Haramark.\u201d", "Hao Win smiled faintly.", "\u201cI witnessed it clearly at the Banquet. He visited the minority faction, consoling them to join his cause. He persuaded the majority faction and subdued anyone trying to break the harmony with violence. And when he brought up the idea of exchanging the Dissonant Wish\u2026 I was deeply moved. He used his cards at the perfect timing. And I knew immediately that I could never do the same.\u201d", "Ming Jie who was listening carefully said.", "\u201cIf you are trying to draw a comparison to Carpe Diem\u2019s recent action, I would like to point out that violence is an employable method as well.\u201d", "\u201cI acknowledge that.\u201d", "Hao Win agreed right away.", "\u201cSuppressing the enemy with your strength is a necessary method. I know that. But\u2026\u201d", "Saying this, Hao Win looked back at the imposing building.", "\u201cHe was drunk.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cGetting used to something\u2026 is similar to being inebriated.\u201d", "He spoke with a hint of regret.", "\u201cThe more you flaunt authority, the more you become addicted. The more you fall in love, the more you become enamored. And the more you use strength, the more you become drunk on it.", "\u201cSimilarly, the more you fall into madness, the deeper you fall. Almost like getting more inebriated as you drink.\u201d", "The gentle drizzle was drenching Hao Win\u2019s clothes before he noticed. Hao Win took his eyes off the building and sighed.", "He wasn\u2019t saying that it was bad to run while looking forward. There were certainly times when it was necessary.", "The problem was the mental state of the person running.", "Was he running while looking forward? Or was he unable to look anywhere else?", "That wasn\u2019t all. He had to tread carefully even if he was running with a sharp mind, but now he was rushing forward while intoxicated. He wasn\u2019t taking breaks to look back, nor was he looking around at the people running with him.", "Hao Win smacked his lips for a long time before turning his gaze back down.", "\u201cHow are the remaining seven organizations\u2019 movements?\u201d", "\u201cNothing seems out of the ordinary.\u201d", "\u201cSo they\u2019ve decided to lay low.\u201d", "\u201cFor now, at least. But given their personalities, I doubt they\u2019ll stay still for long.\u201d", "This couldn\u2019t continue. An unjust attack could come flying at his back at any moment. In the worst-case scenario, he might even trip on an obstacle right in front of him.", "The moment Seol Jihu fell, the hyenas biding their time would pounce excitedly and eat to their hearts\u2019 content, not leaving behind even a single piece of meat, making sure that he could not stand up ever again.", "Hao Win wanted to make Seol Jihu take a break, but the water had already been spilled. Just like Seol Jihu said, they were now in a situation where they had to see things to the end.", "If they stopped halfway, it would be worse than not starting at all.", "This was the cause of Hao Win\u2019s dilemma.", "\u201cI doubt anything bad will happen with Miss Foxy by his side, but\u2026 I guess there\u2019s no other way.\u201d", "Hao Win muttered under his breath. Ming Jie finally put the jacket over him and lowered his hand.", "\u201cHave you decided, sir?\u201d", "\u201cDecided or not, we don\u2019t have a choice. We\u2019ve been forced.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t that they were in a horrible situation with no way out. They just had to help Seol Jihu so he could run while only looking forward until this matter was fully resolved.", "In other words\u2026", "\u201cThe Triads will have to become Carpe Diem\u2019s shield for a while.\u201d", "Announcing resolutely, Hao Win looked back at Ming Jie.", "\u201cCan you contact a few rogues?\u201d", "\u201cI have their contact info\u2026 but may I know why?\u201d", "\u201cEven as a shield, I\u2019m not the type to sit around and take a beating. You can use shields to attack too. You know, bashing and striking.\u201d", "Hao Win cackled as he took out a pack of cigarettes. Ming Jie tilted his head, but didn\u2019t ask any further.", "\u201cI\u2019ll look into it.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t look for them in Eva, but in Haramark\u2026 no, it\u2019s fine as long as they\u2019re not from Eva. Remember, they cannot be from Eva.\u201d", "\u201cHow many will we need?\u201d", "Ming Jie asked bluntly.", "\u201cEnough to observe all of Eva\u2019s organizations. Bring them here as soon as possible. And be discrete.\u201d", "Hao Win revealed his teeth and smiled.", "\u201cIt\u2019s war.\u201d", "*", "The Carpe Diem building had several meeting rooms as Kim Hannah had created one on each floor in consideration of creating multiple smaller teams in the future.", "Today\u2019s meeting took place in the grand conference room which was spacious enough to fit over 100 people.", "\u201cEva\u2019s organizations have split up their territories well, but that\u2019s only when it comes to land. For business, they mostly operate together.\u201d", "Kim Hannah\u2019s voice had enough force to fill the entire room.", "\u201cThe only difference is which side is in charge and which side takes more benefits.\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked back at a chalkboard which contained three provisions.", "\u201cEva\u2019s organizations make money through three primary methods. The first is real estate, the second is slave hunt and trade, and the third is loan-sharking and prostitution.\u201d", "Jang Maldong furrowed his brows.", "\u201cAmong these, Leader Seol Jihu recently led the charge to ruin the slave hunt and trade. It\u2019s hard to say it\u2019s been stopped 100 percent, but with the royal administrator\u2019s declaration and the royal family strengthening their border patrol, the organizations should stay quiet for a while.\u201d", "In truth, Seol Jihu had more than ruined the slave hunt and trade as he had directly affected future prospects as well.", "Everyone knew that the organizations suffered a great loss. Now, Eva\u2019s organizations were choosing to lay low rather than take action.", "But that didn\u2019t mean they would let Carpe Diem do as it wished. They had to be scheming to make up their losses somehow. Since real estate was an asset they almost fully owned, they wouldn\u2019t be able to milk any more money out of it.", "\u201cSo, it\u2019s highly likely that they\u2019ll shift their focus on loan-sharking and prostitution.\u201d", "They were already milking this revenue stream, but now they would squeeze it dry. After all, even a dried squid would produce some water when wrung.", "\u201cPeople who aren\u2019t familiar with Eva call it the City of Priests, but the ones who are familiar call it the City of Luxury and Pleasure.\u201d", "Kim Hannah placed her hands on the long table and looked around.", "\u201cHas anyone gone outside at night?\u201d", "\u201cMm, I have.\u201d", "Hugo nodded while smiling in satisfaction.", "\u201cEva\u2019s nightlife is well known. For one, it\u2019s cheap. It\u2019s also fun picking and choosing who you\u2026\u201d", "Hugo trailed off, unable to finish his sentence, as Seol Jihu stared at him fixedly. Kim Hannah smiled.", "\u201cRight, Eva\u2019s nightlife is flocked by Earthlings. Why do you think that is?\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? They borrowed money from loan sharks and failed to pay up, so they were pulled into prostitution.\u201d", "Chohong spoke apathetically.", "\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Can you take a look at the paper I gave you?\u201d", "Kim Hannah said as she raised a piece of paper she had handed out earlier. After a few ruffles, her voice rang out again.", "\u201cI personally went out to gather this information. One woman couldn\u2019t endure Paradise\u2019s difficult livelihood and borrowed money from Eva\u2019s organization. The amount was 30 silvers. Four years went by and now\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah looked down at the paper and took a brief pause before looking back up.", "\u201cThe amount she owes is 70.8 silvers.\u201d", "That was an annual interest of 34 percent. It was the same as borrowing 15,150,000 won on Earth and having to return 35,743,000 won four years later.", "Seol Jihu gasped at the super high interest rate.", "\u201cFor just 70 silvers\u2026\u201d", "Yi Seol-Ah tilted her head and murmured carefully.", "\u201cJust?\u201d", "\u201cWell, look at you, aren\u2019t you a rich man.\u201d", "Kim Hannah and Maria glared at him simultaneously. Seol Jihu dropped his head.", "\u201cListen, most men have been conscripted away and only women are left in the city. They can\u2019t work as coachmen and no one will use them as porters. These women have to take care of their parents\u2019 and their children\u2019s livelihood by themselves. Can you still say it\u2019s just 70 silvers?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t shoot your mouth off if you haven\u2019t experienced it personally.\u201d", "Phi Sora also chimed in with a frustrated tone.", "Thinking about it again, Seol Jihu had only become rich from the Pagoda of Dreams expedition. Before that, his entire savings consisted of half a piece of gold, several hundred silver coins, and three or four decorations.", "And that was after he was successful in many other missions and made good money.", "More importantly, Earthlings and Paradisians had vastly different ways of making money and vastly different earnings. With a long war that had continued on for dozens of years, the reality of Paradise was that Paradisians who were at the lowest social class found it difficult to even see a single silver coin.", "There was a reason people said organizations were nobles, Earthlings were peasants, and Paradisians were slaves.", "Chohong locked her hands and stretched them up.", "\u201cUwaaaaah! So you\u2019re saying charging so much in interest is illegal and we should go beat them up for it?\u201d", "Kim Hannah shook her head.", "\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cLending money and receiving interest in return. That isn\u2019t illegal in the slightest.\u201d", "Chohong paused and blinked in confusion.", "\u201cThe annual interest rate of 34 percent, this amount has been agreed upon by the royal palace. They cannot and should not do anything to break it.\u201d", "Seol Jihu\u2019s eyes narrowed.", "\u201cEven 34 percent is a lot lower than where it started. Originally, the amount was excessively high, being quadruple of what it is now, and when people failed to pay back the amount, the loan-sharks would take the right to their property and land. Administrator Sorg K\u00fchne eventually got wind of it and did his best to protect the citizens\u2019 interests. While he succeeded in protecting the land rights, he couldn\u2019t do anything about the actual amount owed.\u201d", "In other words, even the absurd 34 percent interest was the result of hard negotiation.", "\u201c\u2026I wonder what would have happened to this city if not for the Federation and Tigol Fortress.\u201d", "Marcel Ghionea muttered to himself.", "But what Kim Hannah said next delivered a twist.", "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing to dig into.\u201d", "Seol Jihu and everyone else turned their attention to Kim Hannah.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing difficult. There\u2019s a very simple and easy solution.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it? Get on with it.\u201d", "Chohong made an irked expression, and Kim Hannah tilted her chin slightly. Then, she spoke.", "\u201cWe just have to buy out their debts. Simply put, we\u2019ll be paying off their debt in their place. Then Paradisian women will be able to escape the cycle of pain they\u2019ve gotten themselves into, right?\u201d", "In an instant, everyone made dumbfounded faces.", "\u201cThis way, we can also shake the foundation of the gold mine the organizations have been using for the past several years. Without women, they can\u2019t operate their business.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "The first one to react was unsurprisingly Maria.", "\u201cAre you crazy, Unni?\u201d", "\u201cNo way, that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d", "Chohong looked dumbstruck as well. They weren\u2019t the only ones who objected as others also chipped in, saying things like, \u201cThat\u2019s all you could come up with after all that?\u201d", "Only Seo Yuhui maintained her silence, her eyes closed in contemplation. Even Jang Maldong looked a little taken aback.", "\u201cMm, I know you mean well, Miss Kim Hannah, but\u2026\u201d", "He furrowed his brows, stopping short of finishing his sentence. Kim Hannah was smiling, enjoying the ruckus with her arms crossed. It was as if she expected this reaction.", "\u201cMiss Hannah?\u201d", "At that moment, Seo Yuhui opened her mouth.", "\u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d", "It was a question that was purely hypothetical. But Kim Hannah went, \u201cOh~\u201d in surprise.", "\u201cNo, we\u2019ll have to try it to know for certain, but it\u2019s more likely to fail.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2014\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s bait. It doesn\u2019t matter if you sprinkle it or not, but it\u2019s probably better to do it.\u201d", "\u201cYou mean there\u2019s a real plan.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s still in the works. I\u2019ll let everyone know when I confirm it.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui nodded. Kim Hannah looked around at everyone else.", "\u201cAny other concerns?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cFeel free to speak your mind. I understand you have misgivings about the plan. But if you\u2019re going to raise questions, can you do it now? I hate it when people cut in.\u201d", "Surprisingly, the mumble died down. Only doubtful gazes remained. It was unlikely that Paradise\u2019s infamous scammer would have brought up a losing scheme, but Chohong was reluctant as she just couldn\u2019t understand the true meaning.", "\u201cI mean\u2026 it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t do it. But it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Even if we\u2019re well-off, how can we pay off everyone\u2019s debts? Maybe if it\u2019s just a part of it\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYeah, just a part is fine.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cEven a king is unable to take care of all the poor. So we just have to help a little for the sake of this plan. That\u2019s more than enough.\u201d", "Kim Hannah took out a new piece of paper.", "\u201cI surveyed around 40 households yesterday. The sample size is small, but they each had around 87 silver coins in debt. Just by donating a gold coin, you can save about eleven people. Ten would be able to save 110.\u201d", "Kim Hannah smiled sweetly.", "\u201cAnd you all have gold eggs, gold coins, silver chunks, silver coins, gems, and more. Thousands in total.\u201d", "\u201cI have a question as well.\u201d", "Jang Maldong raised his hand.", "\u201cEven if we pay off their debt, that won\u2019t solve the underlying problem. These women have to use most of the money they make by prostitution to pay off the interest, but it isn\u2019t as if Paradisians aren\u2019t taking a single copper coin home. Of course, the organizations are leaving some for them so these women don\u2019t die of hunger, but it\u2019s true that this is how these women make their living.\u201d", "He was right. Just because the women would be relieved of their debts, it didn\u2019t mean they would be free to live happy lives. Unless their livelihood was guaranteed, they would have to borrow money again or continue prostitution.", "\u201cThat\u2019s true. But that problem can be solved by temporarily donating food as well. With our money, of course.\u201d", "Maria groaned yet again.", "\u2018Hm\u2026\u2019", "However, Seol Jihu was thinking that this plan was entirely doable in the short term. Only the prices of land and High Ranker equipment were absurdly expensive. Other items\u2019 prices were relatively normal.", "In the past, although it was only possible with the Haramark Royal Family\u2019s help, Seol Jihu had helped to accommodate hundreds of villagers from Ramman Village with a single gold bar.", "Chohong sent a sharp glance.", "\u201cYou\u2019re not forcing us, are you?\u201d", "\u201cOf course not. We\u2019re planning to use a part of the organization\u2019s funding. You don\u2019t have to pay anything if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d", "\u201cJeez, you make it sound like you\u2019re being nice and giving us a chance to be generous.\u201d", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s rare to get opportunities like this.\u201d", "\u201cHaha, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s hard to get opportunities to burn money like this.\u201d", "As Chohong commented sarcastically, Maria cheered her on from the side. Regardless, Kim Hannah raised two fingers.", "\u201cEven if you can receive two benefits from it?\u201d", "Chohong\u2019s eyebrows went up.", "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to say, \u2018Oh~ You can gain the favor of the public~\u2019 are you?\u201d", "\u201cThat is important to us, but if you don\u2019t care\u2026\u201d", "Kim Hannah obediently folded one finger. However, she still had one finger up."]}
