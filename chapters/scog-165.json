The difference got that big?\u201d", "\u201cIt was about even at first at 5 wins and 5 losses, but Sora Unni suddenly just sort of awakened and won six times in a row.\u201d", "While a rather unbelievable conversation was unfolding, Jang Maldong walked in.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s all this ruckus about?\u201d", "The appearance of Paradise\u2019s legend and elder made the room fall completely silent.", "Oh Rahee quietly got up from the floor.

Verbal abuse and a foot face slap?", "[Is the Old Man doing well?]", "Now that he thought about it, Oh Rahee seemed to know Jang Maldong.

These had to be habits ingrained into her from the education she received at a young age and her experience in commanding people.", "Although her words sometimes didn\u2019t match her actions like just now, the man didn\u2019t think it was anything strange.", "Her face was the same. Despite having ice-cold facial features, she had rich expressions.", "She had practiced them without a doubt, but never mind looking artificial, they looked more genuine than the authentic ones.", "But something felt off. It was almost like she was wearing clothes that didn\u2019t fit her.", "This invisible sense of incongruity was the reason the man felt nauseous whenever he stood in front of Yun Seohui.", "Of course, he didn\u2019t show any of this on the outside and did his best to smile.", "\u201cThank you. I\u2019m happy that you liked it.\u201d", "\u201cI loved it. This is exactly what I wanted. It\u2019s not formal and static, but full of vitality and vividness\u2026 Am I right in thinking that you heard and wrote this yourself?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right. It came from an Archer named Lara Wolff.\u201d", "\u201cLara Wolff?\u201d", "Yun Seohui\u2019s eyes widened before blinking repeatedly. If someone unfamiliar with her saw this, they would smile inadvertently.", "However, the man swallowed hard.", "\u201cShe completed Stage 1 and 2 of the Banquet. She said she owed a great debt to Seol Jihu.\u201d", "\u201cOh~? Yet she sang like a bird?\u201d", "\u201cShe showed signs of being wary at first. But when I told her Seol Jihu was Sinyoung\u2019s employee and that this report would be used as a reference for the September evaluation, she did her best to place him on a pedestal.\u201d", "\u201cWow! And it would have been perfect if you said she needed to speak truthfully and in detail to assess him fairly.\u201d", "\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d", "Yun Seohui grinned. Seeing that she seemed happy, the man carefully spoke up.", "\u201cUm\u2026 Executive Director Yun.\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cThere is a meeting with the royal family soon. President wanted you to think about the matter carefully\u2026.\u201d", "Resolving the reinforcement requests from six other cities was Scheherazade and Sinyoung\u2019s top priority.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m reading this.\u201d", "Her frail finger flicked the paper in her hand. The man fixed his posture and stood tall.", "Yun Seohui had a habit of acting playfully whenever she was relaxed. Although she sometimes said things that only she seemed to understand, nothing she said was nonsensical.", "\u201cManager.\u201d", "Hearing Yun Seohui call him, the man became nervous to his bones. He would need to concentrate strongly if he wanted to understand even a tiny bit of what she was about to say.", "\u201cWould you like to make a bet with me?\u201d", "\u201cA bet?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Betting on whether the Parasites\u2019 Seven Armies will show up in Haramark or not. How about it?\u201d", "\u201cT-The Seven Armies?\u201d", "The man stuttered.", "\u201cI\u2019ll bet on them coming. At least one, perhaps even two.\u201d", "\u201cBut the Federation is preparing for a frontal assault\u2026. If they did that, wouldn\u2019t they lose control over Tigol Fortress, which they spent so much effort to conquer?\u201d", "\u201cGenerally speaking, yes. But~ this Parasite Unni acts a little random sometimes.\u201d", "A look of confusion brushed past the man\u2019s face. Yun Seohui had to be the only person in Paradise who referred to the Parasite Queen in such a friendly manner.", "\u201cSometimes, I imagine. What if I were the Parasite Queen? What would I do to conquer this world? \u2026Then, I often find myself thinking the same thing Unni does.\u201d", "The man looked like he didn\u2019t know what to say or do.", "\u201cDid you know? That there has been a strange common point every time the Parasite Queen led the Seven Armies to attack the human forces.\u201d", "\u201cA common point?\u201d", "\u201cYes. A secretive common point between Parasite Unni and me.\u201d", "The man nibbled on his poor lips. Perhaps liking this reaction, Yun Seohui interlocked her fingers and made a pleased smile.", "\u201cI might chuck it up to coincidence if it happened once or twice\u2026 but she\u2019d always kill the children I have my eyes on. She would either Parasitize them and take them, or cleanly murder them.\u201d", "\u201cIs, is that true?\u201d", "The man\u2019s tone went up.", "\u201cYes, of course, it is.\u201d", "Answering with a clear voice, Yun Seohui crossed her arms. Her gaze went up to the ceiling.", "\u201cWho was it again? Ah, right. Marika Larisa. You\u2019ve heard of her, right?\u201d", "\u201cThe Magician from Romania? She was famous in the past when she was together with the Archer of Steel.\u201d", "\u201cRight. I was eyeing her because she was the only Magician who wielded photons rather than the elements, but Parasite Unni took her from me. By commanding Vulgar Chastity, that is.\u201d", "Yun Seohui crossed her legs and shrugged.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just once or twice that this happened.\u201d", "\u201cThen\u2026 this is war is\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cSeol Jihu. His reputation has spread across Paradise lately, hasn\u2019t it? This is what I think.\u201d", "The man looked as if he found this hard to believe. If Yun Seohui wasn\u2019t the one telling him all this, he would have snorted and turned his back on such nonsense a long time ago.", "\u201cBut, even so\u2026 Tigol Fotress is on the line\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cWell, we\u2019ll find out. The question is what we should do.\u201d", "The man organized his thoughts before speaking.", "\u201cExecutive Director Yun, if things are as you say, then can\u2019t we call Seol Jihu to Scheherazade? We can come up with a good reason.\u201d", "\u201cThen Parasite Unni\u2019s blade will be directed here. Although we might be in a safe position now, it won\u2019t be a final solution.\u201d", "\u201cThen why don\u2019t we just leave things be?\u201d", "\u201c?\u201d", "\u201cYou see\u2026 just as you say, Seol Jihu\u2019s position is going up by the day. Although this is my personal opinion, it might be difficult for us to do anything about that at this point\u2026.\u201d", "At that moment, his eyes met Yun Seohui\u2019s. Seeing her cold gaze, goosebumps shot up on his back.", "Her sharp eyes curled to the shape of a crescent moon.", "\u201cYou bring up an interesting point.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t expect his rate of growth to exceed even Sung Shihyun. Well, it\u2019s partly thanks to Director Kim Hannah doing a good job masking him\u2026 but anyway, it\u2019s true that he has gotten more difficult to control. You are certainly correct about that.\u201d", "Hearing this, the man finally let out the breath he had been holding in.", "\u201cBut is there a need to control him?\u201d", "The sharpness in Yun Seohui\u2019s expression slowly loosened.", "\u201cIf we can\u2019t force him to come to us, we just have to make it so that he comes to us himself.\u201d", "As Yun Seohui relaxedly fiddled with the report, her head slowly tilted back, and her black hair reaching her butt drooped down further.", "\u201cI told you. That it\u2019s interesting.\u201d", "Putting the report paper against the light in the ceiling, she made a reserved smile and laughed inaudibly.", "\u201cHis actions all have a clear cause and effect.

That person is also going back? I thought she returned.\u201d", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, right? It\u2019s not like an emergency draft call has been issued for us.\u201d", "\u201cBut she\u2019d usually\u2026.\u201d", "Seo Yuhui cut through the gate pathway while enduring the gazes of dozens of people. Then, she disappeared into the portal.", "Flash! With a burst of light, the scenery changed.", "Having returned to Earth, Seo Yuhui let out a soft sigh. Looking around at the familiar room, she grabbed her phone from the top of the drawer and quickly punched in the numbers.", "Trrr, trrr\u2026 It seemed like the dial would last for a while, but it suddenly cut off.", "\u2014Yes?", "A voice mixed with an electronic sound came out. Seo Yuhui closed her eyes.", "After a moment of hesitation, she took a deep breath and opened her mouth.", "\u201cPlease help us.\u201d", "After a long silence\u2026", "\u2014\u2026Tell me the details.", "A tranquil voice flowed out.", "*", "Seol Jihu\u2019s complexion looked better than one might imagine. It wasn\u2019t that he was no longer feeling worried or anxious. It was because he heard good news.", "Two, in fact.", "First was that Seo Yuhui became the second Level 8 in the history of Paradise. Because he knew about this and expected the advancement to go smoothly, he could accept it without being too shocked.", "But what surprised him the most was Scheherazade announcing that they would mostly reinforce Haramark and even declaring an emergency draft call.", "Seol Jihu wondered if Yun Seora had a hand in this matter, but from the newspaper that the assassin group got him, all evidence was pointing towards Sinyoung\u2019s Yun Seohui.", "Evidently, she had strongly suggested that Haramark was likely to become the main battlefield and had served a pivotal role in making the Scheherazade Royal Family form their decision.", "But not stopping at that, she apparently had pleaded for all Executors other than those of the three missing positions to gather.", "\u2018Yun Seohui\u2026.\u2019", "That was Yun Seora\u2019s older sister.
