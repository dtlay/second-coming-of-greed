It did sound childish.", "\u201cI\u2019ve never felt envy or hatred towards Valhalla, nor have I ever considered you my rival. Because the achievements Valhalla has made in recent years are not something that Sinyoung can match.\u201d", "Yun Seohui spoke in a low but articulate voice.", "\u201cOf course, I understand this is sudden and that it may be hard for you to believe me. I have no excuse for that. However\u2026.\u201d", "She let out a sigh and cleared her throat.", "\u201cIf I really thought badly of you\u2026 I would have done something about it a long time ago.

I\u2019m merely stating the fact that I had many chances to betray you, but I chose not to.\u201d", "A faint smile spread across Yun Seohui\u2019s face.", "\u201cBecause the thought has never once crossed my mind. I admired you, Representative of Valhalla, for all the incredible achievements you made for the sake of Paradise. I wanted to become your friend and help you in any way I could.\u201d", "She slowly lowered her gaze and continued.", "\u201cOf course, my opinion is mine alone\u2026.

Because of the consequences.\u201d", "\u201cWell, yes\u2026.\u201d", "Even Phi Sora couldn\u2019t find any fault with that.", "\u201cI mean, she did swear on her god as a priest\u2026. And our representative basically backed her into a corner\u2026.
